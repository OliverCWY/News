The chart-topping, electronic duo KLF provided many of the dance floor-fillers of the early 90s. Then in August 1994 the pop-producing pair, Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty, travelled to a remote Scottish island where, in a disused boathouse, they burnt two suitcases of cash amounting to one million pounds – all in the name of art. But why?

How to Burn a Million Quid is a comic, surreal, fast-moving account of this true story. It follows the agents of chaos as they blaze a trail to Sweden, the North Pole and the Sierra Nevada, via Northampton, before arriving finally on Jura. This sonic roller-coaster features Paul Higgins (The Thick of It, Line of Duty) as Bill, and Nicholas Burns (Nathan Barley, The World’s End) as Jimmy. Oh, and a talking salmon.
