That helped send JPMorgan's profit plummeting 69% in the first quarter. America's largest bank by assets said its net income fell to $2.9 billion in the first three months of the year, compared to $9.2 billion in the same period last year.

Net revenue dipped slightly to $29.1 billion from $29.9 billion year-over-year.

JPMorgan JPM CEO Jamie Dimon described the first quarter as an unprecedented challenge in the earnings release . However, Dimon noted that absent the loan reserve, the bank had a fairly decent first quarter, and it remains in a strong financial position.
