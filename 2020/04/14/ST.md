新加坡-从即日起，每个人出门时必须佩戴口罩，这是强制措施，以遏制冠状病毒的进一步扩散，这是强制性的。
他说，人们在进行跑步或慢跑等运动时可能会摘掉口罩，但事后必须戴上口罩。
负责疫情爆发的多部委特别工作组的共同主席黄先生表示，政府也在寻求减少被认为必不可少的服务数量。
在强制性使用口罩方面，黄宏发强调，新规定并不表示鼓励外出。
黄先生表示，要求在公共场合戴口罩的要求可能会延长到5月4日结束的断路器期限之后。

SINGAPORE - It is mandatory, with immediate effect, for everyone to wear a mask when they step out as part of stricter measures to curb the further spread of the coronavirus.
People may remove their masks when engaging in exercise such as running or jogging, but they must put them on afterwards, he said.
Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force tackling the outbreak, said the Government is also seeking to reduce the number of services considered essential.
On the mandatory use of masks, Mr Wong stressed that the new requirement does not mean going out is encouraged.
Mr Wong said the requirement to wear masks in public may extend even beyond the circuit breaker period, which ends on May 4.

截至周一（4月13日），新加坡已有2900例冠状病毒病例，而香港的病例数刚刚突破1000例，为1,009例。
自农历新年假期以来，香港的学校已关闭，而新加坡的学校则于4月7日全面关闭。

“在香港和新加坡，我相信绝大多数是合作的，在这两个国家中，只有一小部分顽固和不合作的人。

HONG KONG - Both Hong Kong and Singapore have been lauded globally for their handling of the Covid-19 crisis but the number of confirmed cases in Hong Kong has slowed to single digits, while it has soared in Singapore.
As of Monday (April 13), Singapore has more than 2,900 cases of coronavirus, while Hong Kong just passed the 1,000 mark at 1,009.
Hong Kong schools have been shut since the Chinese New Year holidays, while full closure of schools in Singapore took effect on April 7.
More importantly, Hong Kong residents are highly sensitive about their socio-political conditions and have little faith in the government, he said.
"In both Hong Kong and Singapore, I believe the vast majority are cooperative and in both, there is a small recalcitrant and uncooperative minority.

墨尔本（路透社）-澳大利亚和新西兰周二（4月14日）否决了放宽对旅行和公共聚会的严格限制的呼吁，尽管它们成功地遏制了Covid-19的蔓延。
但是澳大利亚总理斯科特•莫里森（Scott Morrison）表示，该国距离取消任何限制还有“数周之遥”。
澳大利亚在星期日和星期一仅记录了63例新感染病例，使2500万人口的总病例数达到6366。
新西兰是一个拥有500万人口的国家，周二仅收到8例新病例，总数为1,072例，是三周以来的最低每日增幅。
新西兰已经实施了严格的在家禁闭措施，而澳大利亚对行动，聚会和公共活动实行了严格的限制。

MELBOURNE (REUTERS) - Australia and New Zealand on Tuesday (April 14) brushed aside calls for an easing of tough restrictions on travel and public gatherings despite their success in curbing the spread of Covid-19.
But Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the country was still “many weeks away” from lifting any restrictions.
Australia registered just 63 new infections on Sunday and Monday, bringing the total number of cases to 6,366 for a population of 25 million.
New Zealand, a nation of five million, saw just eight new cases on Tuesday for a total of 1,072, its lowest daily increase in more than three weeks.
New Zealand has enforced a strict stay-at-home lockdown while Australia imposed tight restrictions on movement, gatherings and public activities.

朝鲜军方说，朝鲜星期二（4月14日）向日本海（也称为东海）发射了几枚可疑巡航导弹。
参谋长联席会议（JCS）在一份声明中说，从该国东部的蒙雄发射的“多枚弹丸”被认为是“短程巡航导弹”。
相比之下，巡航导弹在低空飞行-有时仅高出地面几米，很难被发现-并在整个飞行过程中保持动力。
JCS说，星期二的导弹在落入水中之前先经过日本海，也被称为东海。
平壤过去曾发射过巡航导弹。

SEOUL (AFP) - North Korea on Tuesday (April 14) fired several suspected cruise missiles towards the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, the South's military said.
The “multiple projectiles” fired from Munchon in the east of the country were believed to be “short-range cruise missiles,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a statement.
In contrast cruise missiles travel at low altitudes – sometimes just a few metres above the surface, making them hard to detect – and are powered throughout their flight.
Tuesday’s missiles travelled over the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, before coming down in the water, the JCS said.
Pyongyang has fired cruise missiles in the past.

在紫外线照射下，较暗的部分显示出未洗的区域，表明洗手不正确。
相比之下，使用七步法用肥皂洗手的C人的清洁度读数为26，处于“一般清洁”范围内。
在紫外线下，B人的手上仍然可见污渍，而C人的手则少得多。
然而，为了在Covid-19大流行期间维持个人卫生，他补充说，用肥皂和水彻底洗手就足够了，并建议抗菌肥皂还有其他好处。
但是，由于病毒需要物理冲洗和肥皂清洁剂才能破坏其结构，因此只要使用一个七步洗手过程，普通肥皂就足够了。

When under UV light, darkened parts show unwashed areas, signalling that the hand washing was not done correctly.
In contrast, Person C, who washed her hands with soap using the seven-step method, achieved a cleanliness reading of 26, which is within the "generally clean" range.
Under the UV light, Person B's hands still have visible stains on it, while Person C's hands are much less stained.
To maintain one's hygiene amid the Covid-19 pandemic, however, he added that washing hands thoroughly with soap and water would be sufficient, and suggested that anti-bacterial soap has an added advantage.
However, as viruses require physical flushing and soap detergent to break its structure, regular soap will suffice as long as one practises the seven-step hand washing process.
