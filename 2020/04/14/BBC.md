在小说中，她观察了流行病消退后想象中的世界。
随着我们增加阅读时间，为新世界的出现做准备，这些问题需要深思。

Camus’ The Plague, in which the city of Oran in Algeria is shut down for months as the plague decimates its people (as happened in Oran in the 19th Century), also abounds with parallels to today’s crisis.
Local leaders are reluctant at first to acknowledge the early signs of the plague dying rats littering the streets.
She is one of nine survivors who flee New York City during the fictitious 2011 Shen fever pandemic.
In her novel, she looks at what happens in her imagined world after the pandemic fades away.
These are questions to be pondered as we increase our reading time, and prepare for the new world to emerge.

“这真是广岛人的灵魂食品。”如果您去过广岛，即使您没有尝试过，也会闻到御好烧的味道。

It’s literally soul food for Hiroshima people.”If you’ve ever been to Hiroshima, you’ll have smelled okonomiyaki, even if you didn’t try it.

国家统计局（ONS）的新数据显示，今年英格兰和威尔士的护理院有217人死亡，其中提到了Covid-19。
该国两家领先的养老院公司周二发布了自己的数据，显示最近几周有521人死亡。
ONS的数据发布之际，主要慈善机构警告说，英国已将许多老年人从冠状病毒数据中“喷出”。
目前，政府的每日死亡人数不包括医院以外的死亡人数。
截至4月3日，在英格兰和威尔士登记的406例涉及Covid-19的死亡中，发生在医院外：

New figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) show that 217 deaths in care homes in England and Wales have mentioned Covid-19 this year.
Two of the country's leading care home companies published their own figures on Tuesday, showing 521 deaths in recent weeks.
The ONS figures come as leading charities warn that many older people are being "airbrushed" out of coronavirus figures in the UK.
Currently, the government's daily toll does not include deaths outside of hospitals.
Of the 406 deaths involving Covid-19 in England and Wales registered in the year up to April 3, that occurred outside hospitals:

国际货币基金组织将全球衰退描述为自1930年代大萧条以来最严重的衰退。
国际货币基金组织首席经济学家吉塔·戈皮纳特（Gita Gopinath）表示，这场危机可能在未来两年内使全球GDP减少9万亿美元（7.2万亿英镑）。
预计如果大流行在2020年下半年消退，明年全球增长率将反弹至5.8％。
“更糟糕的增长结果是可能的，甚至有可能。”
戈皮纳斯女士说，自大萧条以来，发达经济体和发展中经济体都将首次陷入衰退。

The IMF described the global decline as the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Gita Gopinath, the IMF's chief economist, said the crisis could knock $9 trillion (£7.2 trillion) off global GDP over the next two years.
It expects global growth to rebound to 5.8% next year if the pandemic fades in the second half of 2020.
"Much worse growth outcomes are possible and maybe even likely."
Global painMs Gopinath said that for the first time since the Great Depression, both advanced and developing economies were expected to fall into recession.

令人担忧的是，Imagination Technologies的中国所有者已重新努力将敏感安全软件的所有权转让给中国控制的公司。
Imagination Technologies于2017年9月被一家总部位于美国的中国国有投资公司Canyon Bridge收购，该公司又由一家中国国有投资基金中国改革集团拥有。

Imagination Technologies was acquired by a US-based but Chinese state-owned investment firm called Canyon Bridge in September 2017, which is in turn owned by a Chinese state-owned investment fund called China Reform.
There is no suggestion that Huawei is directly connected to Imagination, or its ultimate owners - the state-owned China Reform investment fund.
Neither Imagination Technologies, nor its owner China Reform returned the BBC's request for comment.

名为“一切”的游戏已有一段时间了。
但是，对于像我这样的人来说，这可以摆脱工作压力和妄想症的困扰，变成一种精致的无聊形式。
根据娱乐零售商协会（ERA）的数据，英国的游戏产业比2019年音乐和电影业的总和更有价值。
当锁定在3月开始时，游戏平台Steam报告了有史以来最高的同时登录用户数。
诸如刺客信条之类的代码指导性大片游戏虽然很成功，但在游戏方面有些困扰。

The game called Everything has been out for a while now.
For someone like me, though, it was an escape from the turbulence of work pressure and paranoia into an exquisite form of boredom.
According to the Entertainment Retailers Association (ERA), the games industry in the UK was more valuable than the music and film industry combined in 2019.
When the lockdown started in March, the gaming platform Steam reported its highest ever number of concurrent users logged on at once.
Code directed blockbuster games like Assassin’s Creed, and was successful, but something bugged her about gaming.

世界各地的其他珊瑚通常不具有相同的生物生存能力。
按照这个速度，到2100年，红海礁石可能是最后的礁石之一。
当Fine和研究小组将硝酸盐，铵盐和磷酸盐等营养物质引入实验时，珊瑚的生理机能受到损害，它们不再具有弹性。
芬说：“仅靠温度是不够的。”
“如果要确保亚喀巴湾和北部红海成为珊瑚礁的避难所，我们就必须消除当地的压力。”与Fine，Meibom和其他几位科学家和外交官一道，Kleinhaus呼吁联合国教科文组织宣布红海礁作为海洋世界遗产，以帮助确保该礁得以持久存在，并受到保护，免受当地威胁，否则可能会损害珊瑚的复原力。

Other corals around the world don’t typically possess the same biological ability to persist.
At this rate, the Red Sea reefs could be one of the last standing by the year 2100.
When Fine and the team introduce nutrients such as nitrate, ammonium and phosphate into the experiments, the corals’ physiology is compromised and they’re no longer as resilient.
“It’s not enough to be resilient to temperature,” Fine says.
“If we are to secure the Gulf of Aqaba and the northern Red Sea as a coral reef refuge, we have to remove the local stress.”Along with Fine, Meibom, and several other scientists and diplomats, Kleinhaus is calling on Unesco to declare the Red Sea reef as a Marine World Heritage Site, to help ensure that the reef persists and will be protected from local threats that could otherwise compromise the coral’s resilience.

现在，Najin和Fatu是世界上仅存的北部白犀牛-都无法怀孕。
它涉及精心保存的精子-死于苏尼，苏丹和其他北方雄性白犀牛。
非洲白犀牛有两个亚种-濒临灭绝的北部白犀牛和更普遍的南部白犀牛。
四只野生雌性南部白犀牛与它们的后代一起被封闭在自然栖息地中，与最后两只剩余的北部白犀牛相距不远。
下一步是将经过消毒的南部白犀牛与雌性放在一起-并可能代孕。

Now Najin and Fatu are the only northern white rhinos left in the world - and neither can carry a pregnancy.
It involves carefully preserved sperm - taken from Suni and Sudan and other male northern white rhinos before they died.
There are two sub-species of white rhinos in Africa - the near-extinct northern white rhino and the more prevalent southern white rhino.
Four wild female southern white rhinos have been enclosed with their offspring in their natural habitat not far from the last two remaining northern white rhinos.
The next step is to put a sterilised southern white rhino in with the females - and would-be surrogates.

最受欢迎的电子二人组KLF提供了90年代初期的许多舞池填充。

但是，如果您需要一些额外的动力来进行春季大扫除，则可能其中藏有宝藏。
有价值的金属和矿物质被锁在我们积聚在尘土飞扬的角落的旧产品内。
总的来说，我们的房屋和后院是一个“城市矿山”，里面装满了这些等待挖掘的重要材料。
它们中的每一种都包含铜，银甚至金，以及各种有价值的稀土元素。
因此，将其更多地视为将您的ard积物整理成整齐的堆放，以便以后回收的机会。

If you need a little extra motivation for the spring clean, though, there’s probably treasure hidden in there.
Locked inside the old products we hoard in dusty corners are valuable metals and minerals.
Collectively, our homes and backyards are an “urban mine” filled with these essential materials that are just waiting to be dug out.
Each of these contains copper, silver and even gold, along with a wide range of valuable rare earth elements.
So, view this more as an opportunity to sort your hoard into neat piles, for recycling later.
