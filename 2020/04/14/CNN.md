预计该委员会将在周二晚些时候将其计划发送给欧盟成员国，并在周三提交该计划。
该计划要求以科学为基础的退出战略，在成员国之间以“尊重与团结”进行协调。
这实际上是对成员国的决定。”马默说。

The Commission is expected to send its plan to the EU's member states later on Tuesday and to present it on Wednesday.
The plan calls for an exit strategy based on science, coordinated between member states with "respect and solidarity."
This is really a decision for member states," Mamer said.

伦敦（CNN商业报道）冠状病毒大流行正在使全球经济陷入自1930年代大萧条以来最严重的萧条，政府和卫生官员必须共同努力，以防止出现更糟的后果。
这是国际货币基金组织（IMF）的严厉警告，该组织周二表示，如果政策制定者未能协调全球对这种病毒的应对措施，衰退可能会延续到2021年。
“人们可能会称其为“大锁定”，这将大大削弱全球增长。
预计到2021年将部分恢复……但GDP的水平将保持在病毒爆发前的趋势之下，反弹强度尚不确定。”
它补充说：“更糟糕的增长结果是可能的，甚至有可能。”

London (CNN Business) The coronavirus pandemic is plunging the global economy into its deepest slump since the Great Depression of the 1930s and governments and health officials must work together to prevent an even worse outcome.
That's the stark warning from the International Monetary Fund, which said on Tuesday there was a risk of the recession extending into 2021 if policymakers fail to coordinate a global response to the virus.
"The Great Lockdown, as one might call it, is projected to shrink global growth dramatically.
A partial recovery is projected for 2021 ... but the level of GDP will remain below the pre-virus trend, with considerable uncertainty about the strength of the rebound," the IMF said.
"Much worse growth outcomes are possible and maybe even likely," it added.

伊朗国际象棋仲裁员在一月份比赛结束后仍未返回家中，她担心在网上因不戴合适的头巾而受到惩罚后受到惩罚。
巴亚特的担忧来自事件中拍摄的一张照片，该照片似乎表明她没有戴头巾。
巴亚特对美国有线电视新闻网（CNN Sport）说：“我知道我必须遮住头发，所以我像许多伊朗妇女一样这样做，但是我穿着宽松的头巾，因为我不相信头巾。”
在试图专注于手头的工作时，巴亚特随后向伊朗国际象棋联合会寻求保证，伊朗国际象棋联合会已经使她警惕了在家中酝酿的明显风暴。
美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）多次与伊朗国际象棋联合会联系，但未收到任何回应。

The Iranian chess arbiter is yet to return home to her family following the conclusion of the tournament in January, fearing punishment after she was criticized online for not wearing the appropriate headscarf.
Bayat's concerns stem from a photograph taken from the event which appears to show her not wearing a hijab.
"I knew that I had to cover my hair so I did that like many Iranian women but I was wearing a loose hijab because I don't believe in the hijab," Bayat told CNN Sport.
While trying to focus on the job at hand, Bayat was subsequently seeking reassurances from the Iranian Chess Federation who had alerted her to the apparent storm brewing at home.
CNN reached out to the Iranian Chess Federation on multiple occasions but has not received a response.

医生发现，将最病的冠状病毒患者放在肚子上-俯卧位-有助于增加进入肺部的氧气量。
从那以后，美国的医生一直在不同程度上将通气的ARDS患者放在肚子上。

一些医院还把不在重症监护室的冠状病毒患者放在肚子上。

Doctors are finding that placing the sickest coronavirus patients on their stomachs -- called prone positioning - helps increase the amount of oxygen that's getting to their lungs.
Ever since, to varying degrees, doctors in the United States have been placing ventilated ARDS patients on their stomachs.
Now they've doubled down on this with coronavirus patients, and it's paying off.

Some hospitals are also placing coronavirus patients who are not in the intensive care unit on their stomachs.

伦敦（CNN）最新的英国政府数据显示，在英国接受过冠状病毒检测的NHS员工和主要工人中，有三分之一返回了积极结果。
根据周一发布的数据，已经对16,888名属于“关键工人及其家庭”类别，并已表现出症状或与有症状的人生活在一起的人进行了测试。
不是有症状且与不符合英国测试标准的人一起生活的卫生工作者，因此人数不一定代表所有工作者。
政府承受着巨大的压力，要求加大对NHS工人及其家人的测试，并改善他们获得适当的个人防护设备（PPE）的机会。
卫生部长马特·汉考克（Matt Hancock）此前曾表示，最终目标是为所有NHS工人提供测试，而不论其症状如何。

London (CNN) A third of NHS staff and key workers who have been tested for coronavirus in the UK have returned positive results, new British government data shows.
According to figures released Monday, 16,888 people who fall into the category of "key workers and their households," and who have shown symptoms or live with symptomatic people, have been tested.
Health workers who are not symptomatic and do not live with people who are do not meet the UK's criteria for testing, so the number is not necessarily representative of all workers.
The government has been under intense pressure to ramp up testing for NHS workers and their families, and to improve their access to appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
Health Secretary Matt Hancock has previously said that the ultimate goal is to provide testing to all NHS workers regardless of symptoms.

此外，估计有520万人是美国原住民或阿拉斯加原住民，无法获得医疗保健和普遍贫困。
许多美洲原住民高耸于欧洲人之上，探险家惊叹于他们的体力和创造力。
他们带来了天花，麻疹和流行性感冒等疾病，许多美国土著人对此没有免疫力。
如果白人定居者没有试图彻底消灭疾病，美洲印第安人就不会那么容易受到疾病的侵害。
今天，在流行病几乎消灭了五个世纪之后，美洲原住民面临着另一个看不见的掠食者。

Add to that lack of access to health care and pervasive poverty among the estimated 5.2 million people that identity as Native American or Alaskan native.
Many of the Native Americans towered over the Europeans, and explorers marveled at their physical strength and ingenuity.
They brought diseases such as smallpox, measles and influenza, illnesses for which many Native Americans had no immunity.
The Native Americans wouldn't have been so vulnerable to diseases if white settlers were not trying to literally wipe them out.
Today, five centuries after epidemics almost wiped them out, Native Americans are facing another unseen predator.

莫斯科（CNN）莫斯科已经引入了一种数字跟踪系统来强制冠状病毒锁定-但批评人士说，该技术对隐私构成了前所未有的威胁。
莫斯科地区的莫斯科人和居民-14岁或以上的任何人-如果想在城市中四处走动，必须下载QR码。
正式而言，周三的通行证系统成为强制性规定，但有关当局已经在严厉打击城市中的未经许可的活动。
俄罗斯的科技巨头Yandex绘制了一张计算“自我隔离指数”的地图，该地图显示莫斯科居民在过去几天比违反一周前更加放心地违反了自我隔离规则。
但是，一旦完善，隐私权倡导者就会担心QR码系统可能会为入侵行为奠定基础，而这种行为不会随着大流行而消失。

Moscow (CNN) Moscow has introduced a digital tracking system to enforce a coronavirus lockdown -- but critics say the technology represents an unprecedented threat to privacy.
Muscovites and residents of the Moscow region -- anybody 14 years old or above -- must download a QR code if they want to move around their city.
Officially, the pass system becomes mandatory on Wednesday, but authorities are already cracking down on unauthorized movement in the city.
Yandex, Russia's tech giant, created a map calculating "self-isolation index," which showed that Moscow residents were more relaxed about breaching the self-isolation rules in the past days than a week before.
But once perfected, privacy advocates worry the QR code system could lay the ground for an invasive practice that won't disappear with the pandemic.

纽约（CNN商业资讯）随着冠状病毒大流行摧毁了全球经济，摩根大通（JPMorgan）拨出了惊人的68亿美元储备，以使自己免于贷款违约。
这使摩根大通第一季度的利润暴跌了69％。
摩根大通（JPMorgan）首席执行官杰米•戴蒙（Jamie Dimon）将第一季度视为收益发布中前所未有的挑战。
但是，戴蒙指出，由于没有贷款准备金，该银行第一季度的表现还算不错，而且财务状况仍然良好。
戴蒙说：“公司在这场危机中处于优势地位，而我们仍然保持着充足的资本和高度流动性。”

New York (CNN Business) As the coronavirus pandemic crushes the global economy, JPMorgan set aside a stunning $6.8 billion worth of reserves to insulate itself from loan defaults.
That helped send JPMorgan's profit plummeting 69% in the first quarter.
JPMorgan JPM CEO Jamie Dimon described the first quarter as an unprecedented challenge in the earnings release .
However, Dimon noted that absent the loan reserve, the bank had a fairly decent first quarter, and it remains in a strong financial position.
"The company entered this crisis in a position of strength, and we remain well capitalized and highly liquid," said Dimon.

为了遏制冠状病毒的持续蔓延，印度总理纳伦德拉·莫迪已将印度的全国禁闭期延长至5月3日，但他表示，某些避免爆发的州可能被允许恢复“重要活动”。
莫迪星期二在电视讲话中说，至关重要的是要防止该病毒影响该国尚未受影响的部分。
对印度13亿人口的21天锁定期于3月24日一天结束时生效，并定于4月14日星期二到期。
自从执行锁定以来，只有基本服务在运行。
这些包括水，电，卫生服务，消防，杂货店和市政服务。

New Delhi (CNN) Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has extended the country's nationwide lockdown until May 3 in a bid to contain the continued spread of the coronavirus, but said that some states which have avoided outbreaks may be allowed to resume "important activities."
Speaking in a televised address on Tuesday, Modi said it was vital that the virus is prevented from impacting parts of the country that remain unaffected.
The 21-day lockdown for India's 1.3 billion people came into force at the end of the day on March 24 and was set to expire on Tuesday, April 14.
Since the lockdown was enforced, only essential services have been operational.
Those include water, electricity, health services, fire services, grocery stores and municipal services.

据政府周一称，尼加拉瓜有9例确诊病例，正在观察12例，死于Covid-19。
副总统穆里略说：“我们的指挥官丹尼尔在这里，工作和指挥，协调我们为并将继续作出的一切努力，因为我们与该国保持了坚定的妥协。”

But there's been one notable exception -- President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, who has not been seen in public for over 40 days.
The last time the 74-year-old leader was seen in person was during a televised military event on February 21.
Instead, "Vice President Rosario Murillo, who is married to Ortega, told Nicaraguans to remain calm and continue working," the statement noted.
According to the government Monday, there are nine confirmed cases, 12 cases under observation and one death from Covid-19 in Nicaragua.
"Our commander Daniel is here, working and directing, coordinating all the efforts we make, that we are and will continue to make because we have a firm compromise with the country," Vice President Murillo said earlier this month.

根据两项新的研究，如果您严格遵循地中海饮食（以强调蔬菜，全谷类，鱼类和橄榄油而闻名）的饮食，则可以将认知障碍的风险降低一半。
Chew说，地中海饮食似乎并未减慢具有ApoE基因的人的认知能力下降，这大大增加了患阿尔茨海默氏病的风险。
该研究发现，高度坚持地中海饮食有助于降低所有阶段黄斑变性的风险。
如何开始地中海饮食想要跳上地中海饮食潮流并保护您的大脑和眼睛？
专家说，如果以鱼为王，则以橄榄油为地中海饮食中的王者-远离椰子油和棕榈油。

You can reduce your risk for cognitive impairment by half if you closely follow the Mediterranean diet, known for its emphasis on vegetables, whole grains, fish, and olive oil, according to two new studies.
The Mediterranean diet didn't appear to slow cognitive decline in people with the ApoE gene, which dramatically raises the risk for Alzheimer's disease, Chew said.
The study found that high adherence to the Mediterranean diet helped in reducing the risk of macular degeneration through all stages.

If fish is the king, olive oil is the queen in the Mediterranean diet -- stay away from coconut and palm oil, experts say.

人们会敞开窗帘来炫耀一个房间，里面装满了最好的家具，装饰品和艺术品，以此向商人证明他们是值得信赖的。
我不确定为什么我不喜欢窗帘。
距离很远，我从未见过有人用双筒望远镜潜入我的房子，所以我不在乎。
我认为许多荷兰人不使用窗帘，因为我们喜欢灯光，而且没有什么可隐藏的。
这种观点是我住在这里的原因中非常重要的一部分。

People would leave curtains open to show off a room full of the finest of furniture, decorations and art as a way of proving to merchants that they were trustworthy.
Why I don't like curtains, I'm not sure.
It's quite a distance and I've never seen anyone with binoculars lurking outside my house, so I don't care.
I think a lot of Dutch people don't use curtains because we like the light and we don't have anything to hide.
The view is a very pivotal part of the reason I'm living here.

这名男子对他公司的雇员感到惊讶，他们为他组织了一次达索（Dassault）Rafale B喷气式飞机的欢庆活动。
调查人员发现，这位不愿透露姓名的人从未表达过乘坐战斗机飞行的愿望，也没有以前的军事航空经验。
但是该名男子随行，参加了一次三架飞机的训练演习。
Rafale B被法国空军使用，最高时速接近每小时1400公里（每小时870英里）。
不幸的是，那是弹出器座椅按钮，而这名64岁的飞行员从战斗机上飞了出来。

The man had been surprised by employees at his firm, who had organized a joyride in a Dassault Rafale B jet for him as a treat.
The unnamed man had never expressed any desire to fly in a fighter jet and had no previous military aviation experience, investigators discovered.
But the man went through with the ride, joining a three-plane training exercise as a passenger.
The Rafale B is used by the French air force, and has a maximum speed of nearly 1,400 kilometers per hour (870 miles per hour).
Unfortunately, that something was the ejector seat button -- and the 64-year-old flew from the fighter jet.

## 马克·豪瑟（Marc Hauser）：跳伞运动员首次跳入喷气流以促进可持续能源

瑞士冒险家豪瑟（Hauser）被称为“喷射流超人”，是跳入喷射流的第一人，这一壮举上个月被吉尼斯世界纪录正式认可。
豪瑟（Hauser）希望提高人们对他所说的喷射流（大气中的高空气流）尚未开发的清洁能源潜力的认识。
在导演兼电影制片人克劳迪奥·冯·普兰塔（Claudio von Planta）的帮助下，豪瑟斯（Hauser）的飞跃在屡获殊荣的纪录片《追逐喷气流》中获得了不朽的成就。
豪瑟希望他的纪录片在开发可以利用射流能量潜力的技术中“点燃大火”。
在被迫前往澳大利亚跳伞之后，豪瑟认为他实际上跳入喷射流的机会“最大为10％”。

Dubbed the "Jet Stream Superman," Swiss adventurer Hauser is the first person to skydive into the jet stream, a feat which was officially recognized by Guinness World Records last month.
Hauser wanted to raise awareness about what he says is the untapped, clean energy potential of the jet stream, a high-altitude air current in the atmosphere.
With the help of director and filmmaker Claudio von Planta, Hauser's jump was immortalized in an award-winning documentary "Chasing the Jet Stream."
Hauser hopes his documentary "ignites the fire" in developing technology that can harness the energy potential of the jet stream.
After being forced to move to Australia for the jump, Hauser thought the chances of him actually jumping into the jet stream were "maximum 10%."

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
后来空袭被认为是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

但是，美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）采访了包括帕特里夏（Patricia）在内的五名十几岁和二十多岁的女性，他们声称格拉瑟（Glaser）在Bery's Place对其进行了性和情感虐待。
当女孩们反对时，他们说格拉泽会威胁要把他们赶出去。
一些幸存者说，格拉瑟（Glaser）介绍自己是一名医生，但支持起诉的律师告诉美国有线电视新闻网（CNN），他是物理治疗师-不是合格的医生。
Dilen于去年2月在Bery's Place进行的一次警察突袭中因警察的讯问而被捕，后来被释放。
但至少现在，他们说他们开始在贝里故居之外享受生活。

But five women in their late teens and early twenties interviewed by CNN, including Patricia, allege that Glaser sexually and emotionally abused them at Bery's Place.
When the girls objected, they say Glaser would threaten to cast them out on the streets.
Some survivors say Glaser introduced himself as a doctor, but lawyers supporting the prosecution told CNN that he is a physiotherapist -- not a qualified physician.
Dilen was arrested for questioning by police last February during a police raid at Bery's Place, and later released.
But for now, at least, they say they're beginning to enjoy their lives outside of Bery's Place.

## 香港冠状病毒检疫营内的情况

假日营地变成了隔离营地-隔离饮食-温度检查和穿PPE的工作人员在隔离区生活-感觉就像在学校，营地和监狱中一样奇怪。
我的工厂位于鲤鱼门公园，通常是香港岛东部一个绿树成荫的度假村。
这个假日公园是香港用作冠状病毒检疫中心的几处设施之一。
在此之前，我已经在家工作了三个月-因此，在隔离营中做同样的事情并没有多大区别。
但这证明了香港政府对遏制从海外进口的案件并推回本地自满情绪的重视程度。

Holiday camp turned quarantine campLife in quarantine -- with its regimented meals, temperature checks and PPE-wearing staff -- feels like an odd mix of being in school, at camp, and in prison.
My facility, in Lei Yue Mun Park, is normally a leafy holiday village in the east of Hong Kong Island.
This holiday park is one of several facilities being used as coronavirus quarantine centers in Hong KongSince March, that number has surged.
Prior to now, I'd already been working from home for three months -- so doing the same from a quarantine camp hasn't made much of a difference.
But it's a testament to how serious the Hong Kong government is about clamping down on cases imported from overseas, and pushing back on local complacency.
