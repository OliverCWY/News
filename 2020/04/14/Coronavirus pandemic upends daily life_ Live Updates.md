The European Commission is set to propose an action plan for a co-ordinated coronavirus lockdown exit across Europe.

Its proposed plan -- seen by CNN -- says measures to slow the spread of the virus have "come at a dramatic cost for our economy and society, and cannot last indefinitely."

The Commission is expected to send its plan to the EU's member states later on Tuesday and to present it on Wednesday.

European Commission Chief Spokesperson Eric Mamer told CNN Tuesday: “It is up to member states, it is their prerogative to determine when they want to take restrictive measures and when they want to move out of restrictive measures."

The plan says there are two main criteria to assess whether the time has come to begin to relax the restrictions: Has the spread of the disease has significantly decreased for a sustained period? And do health care systems have enough capacity to cope if case numbers were to rise again?

The plan calls for an exit strategy based on science, coordinated between member states with "respect and solidarity."

It says a successful exit strategy would also be dependent on measures being met, including an expanded coronavirus testing capacity to measure contagion and the population's immunity, along with a "harmonized" and "robust" system for contact tracing.

It notes that the exit should be gradual, starting at local levels. Gatherings of people should also be permitted gradually and economic activity should be "phased in."

"Once the exit phase is successfully entered, the next phase would be the recovery, in which the economy needs to pick up pace and get back on a growth path," the four-page document concludes.

"What we have been working on over the past weeks is a roadmap with recommendations, to ensure that when they start to move out of these restrictive measures, they do so in a manner which is effective," Mamer said.

He added that this includes, in particular, "taking into account obviously the situation in other EU countries and … in particular in neighbor countries.”

Mamer said the Commission would be making recommendations as to "what we believe are the main criteria which member states should use when they are taking these decisions."

“We are not going to going to be saying to any specific member state: ‘This is now the right point in time for you to start taking measures to ease the restrictions you have in place’. This is really a decision for member states," Mamer said.

“What we are going to be recommending is a series of criteria and conditions that we think should apply when assessing and ultimately deciding whether it makes sense to start to ease the measures.”
