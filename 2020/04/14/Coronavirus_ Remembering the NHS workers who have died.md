A midwife originally from Hong Kong. A hospital cleaner who became a nurse. A retired village GP who carried on caring for his former patients.

Thousands of people in the UK have now died with coronavirus, including doctors, nurses, surgeons and other NHS workers.

Here are some of their stories.

Originally from the Philippines, Mrs Ballesteros "loved her work as a nurse", her son, Rainier, said.

Kev, as he was known to friends and colleagues, was "renowned for his warm personality, diligence and compassion", Richard Parker, chief executive at Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals, said.

Mr Smith, a plaster technician at Doncaster Royal Infirmary, was "a valued member of the team for over 35 years". Mr Parker said he was "utterly heartbroken" to share the news of his death.

Elbert Rico

Mr Rico worked as a porter at John Radcliffe Hospital, in Oxford, after moving to the UK from the Philippines, in 2004. Married to a nurse at the hospital, he was "popular and hard-working", colleagues said.

His daughter, Carla, set up a GoFundMe page for his funeral which raised £12,000 in a day. "He would walk around the hospital with a smile on his face and very rarely would he call in sick from work," she said.

Oscar King Jr

Mr King Jr was also a porter at John Radcliffe Hospital and also originally from the Philippines.

He is believed to have worked at the hospital for 10 years and was described as a "beloved friend, loving husband, and devoted father" to his 10-year-old daughter.

Sara Trollope, 51

The mother of four was a matron at Hillingdon Hospital, where she cared for older patients with mental health problems and dementia. On Saturday, the trust confirmed her death at Watford General Hospital.

Her husband, Gary, said she was devoted to her family - to her daughters, Gemma and Freya, and twin sons, Kyle and Michael.

"Sara had that unbeatable combination of kindness, selflessness and total determination to get things right for patients", colleague Dr Paul Hopper added.

Donna Campbell

Ms Campbell, a mother of two, was a "treasured" member of staff who could "light up a room with her infectious laugh and bubbly personality", colleagues said.

"She was often found singing and dancing, entertaining patients and staff, making everyone smile," they added. Ms Campbell was a healthcare support worker who worked at the Velindre Cancer Centre, in Cardiff.

She died at the University Hospital Wales in Cardiff on 10 April.

Donald Suelto

Colleagues said the nurse, who was originally from the Philippines and worked at Hammersmith Hospital, in west London, "loved his NHS job".

Last month, he changed his Facebook profile picture to an image of him wearing a protective mask emblazoned with the words: "I can't stay at home, I'm a healthcare worker."

He died after going into self-isolation with coronavirus symptoms, a friend and fellow nurse said.

The grandmother, who worked at Royal Liverpool University Hospital, was an "unsung hero", her local NHS trust said.

Her job was to make arrangements to allow patients to safely leave hospital, having spent most of her career as a care worker for people with disabilities.

"Barbara was a much-loved wife, mum, nan, sister, auntie, friend and beautiful person," her family said. "She loved nothing more than spending precious time with her family."

His son Intisar described the consultant urologist as a "kind and compassionate hero" who had been in "such pain" when he wrote an appeal to the government on Facebook, warning about a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) for NHS workers.

"He wrote that post while he was in that state, just because of how much he cared about his co-workers," his son said.

"He was so caring, he would call us very often to come to his house," family friend and fellow doctor Golam Rahat Khan said.
