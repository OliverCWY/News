如果冠状病毒病例保持稳定，丹麦将从下周起重新开放幼儿园和学校，挪威的儿童将在一周后返回幼儿园。
丹麦“走钢丝”丹麦表示，如果冠状病毒病例保持稳定，则计划从4月15日起将儿童送回学校和幼儿园。
随着政府周一宣布将在本周开始放宽一些冠状病毒的限制，这些严格的遏制努力似乎正在获得回报。
奥地利卫生部表示，截至周四，奥地利确诊的冠状病毒病例数已达到12,969例。
随着这些国家和其他国家在保护公共卫生和保持经济活力之间走钢丝，很明显前方有许多陷阱。

Denmark will reopen kindergartens and schools from next week if coronavirus cases remain stable, and children in Norway will return to kindergarten a week later.
Denmark 'walking the tightrope'Denmark has said it plans to send children back to school and kindergarten from April 15 if coronaviruses cases remain stable.
Those strict containment efforts now appear to be paying off, as the government announced Monday that it would begin relaxing some coronavirus restrictions this week.
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Austria had reached 12,969 as of Thursday, the country's health ministry said.
As these countries and others walk the tightrope between protecting public health and keeping their economies alive, it's clear many pitfalls lie ahead.

根据约翰·霍普金斯大学在美国的病例统计，在美国至少有501,615例冠状病毒病例，并且至少有18,777人死于冠状病毒。
总数包括来自所有50个州，哥伦比亚特区和其他美国领土的案件，以及所有遣返的案件。
怀俄明州是唯一未报告因冠状病毒死亡的州。
IHME主管克里斯·默里（Chris Murray）博士周五晚间对CNN说：“反弹的风险非常大。”
这些预测是基于IHME运行的新的建模方案，该方案假设社会疏远政策将从下个月结束。

There are at least 501,615 cases of coronavirus in the US and at least 18,777 people have died in the US from coronavirus, according to a Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases in the United States.
The totals includes cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other U.S. territories, as well as all repatriated cases.
Wyoming is the only state that is not reporting a death from coronavirus.
"The risk of rebound is very great," IHME Director Dr. Chris Murray told CNN late Friday.
The projections are based on new modeling scenarios run by IHME that assume social distancing policies will end from next month.

如果药物组和安慰剂组的结果相同，则该药物可能没有效果。
在过去的几周中，特朗普发表了与羟氯喹研究有关的一些错误陈述。
医生说几周或几个月。
问题2：法国研究人员已经进行了一项临床研究，显示羟氯喹可以作为冠状病毒的治疗方法。
问题3：是否有人试图推迟羟氯喹的临床试验？

If the drug group and the placebo group have the same results, then it's likely the drug did not have an effect.
Over the past few weeks, Trump has made several erroneous statements relating to hydroxychloroquine studies.
Doctors say weeks or months.
Question \#2: French researchers have already done a clinical study showing hydroxychloroquine works as a treatment for coronavirus.
Question \#3: Have some people tried to delay hydroxychloroquine clinical trials?

那是因为当局采取了特殊的封锁措施，以减缓Covid-19病毒在普吉岛的扩散，普吉岛已成为该国的冠状病毒热点。
截至4月10日，共有170例确诊的Covid-19病例，这个拥有40万人口的小岛，在泰国的77个省中，人均感染率最高。
根据政府统计，普吉岛每10万人中有38.95例，曼谷则为21.90 / 10万。
由于发生冠状病毒，该机场目前对所有商业航班都关闭。
他告诉CNN Travel：“我们估计该岛上80％的酒店目前已经关闭或正在关闭。”

That's because authorities have taken extraordinary lockdown measures to slow the spread of the Covid-19 virus in Phuket, which has emerged as the country's coronavirus hotspot.
With 170 confirmed cases of Covid-19 as of April 10, this island of 400,000 or so residents has the highest infection rate per capita out of all of Thailand's 77 provinces.
According to government statistics, there are about 38.95 cases per 100,000 people in Phuket, versus 21.90 per 100,000 in Bangkok.
The airport is currently closed to all commercial flights due to the coronavirus outbreak.
"We have estimated that 80% of all hotels on the island are currently closed or in the process of closing down," he tells CNN Travel.

默兹说：“人们对该病毒充满了焦虑。”
梅尔兹说，航母“在失去一氧化碳后，以及对与这种病毒作斗争缺乏活动的认识中苦苦挣扎”。
许多水手告诉默兹，他们仍然担心他们前任指挥官的命运。
他讲话的声音也泄露给媒体，他在媒体上亵渎了他，还听到一些机组人员对他大喊大叫。
目前，罗斯福大约4,000名机组人员中的447名以及Crozier已对该病毒进行了阳性测试。

"There was lots of anxiety about the virus," Merz said.
The carrier crew was "struggling in the wake of losing their CO and their perception of the lack of activity regarding fighting the virus," Merz said.
Many sailors told Merz they were still worried about the fate of their former commanding officer.
Audio of his speech also leaked to media in which he used a profanity and some crew members were heard yelling back at him.
Currently, 447 of the Roosevelt's roughly 4,000 crew members, as well as Crozier, have tested positive for the virus.

Valery Hache /法新社/盖蒂图片社（CNN）-一群国际度假者乘坐私人飞机从伦敦飞往法国南部，他们登陆后被法国警察拒之门外。
马赛普罗旺斯机场于4月4日通知法国边境警察，一家英国公司希望从伦敦乘坐飞机飞往马赛，搭载10名克罗地亚，法国，德国，罗马尼亚和乌克兰国籍的乘客。
这名官员告诉美国有线电视新闻网，捷克裸体主义者告诉警察戴口罩。他告诉当局，他有“很多钱”，并希望“支付罚款并去戛纳”。

最近，三趾石龙子（Saiphos equalis）取得了非凡的成就：它产下了三个卵，并在同一孕中又生了另一个婴儿。
原因之一是有些种群通过产卵繁殖，而另一些种群则通过活产繁殖。
悉尼地区的石龙子产卵，尽管卵壳薄且胚胎几乎完全发育。
惠廷顿说，尽管如此，要确定自然选择在这种石龙鱼中所采取的路线是“不可能的”。
她的研究表明，“过渡性”三趾石龙子和活生生的三趾石龙子的子宫具有相似的功能，这可能使该物种从活生子变为产卵。

Recently, a three-toed skink (Saiphos equalis) pulled off an extraordinary feat: It laid three eggs and delivered another baby through live birth in the same pregnancy.
One reason is that some populations reproduce by laying eggs, while others reproduce through live birth.
Skinks around the Sydney area lay eggs, albeit ones with thin shells and embryos that are almost completely developed.
Still, it's "impossible" to determine what course natural selection is taking in this skink species, Whittington said.
Their research shows that the uterus of the "transitional" three-toed skinks and live-bearing three-toed skinks function similarly, which could make it possible for the species to reverse from live-bearing to egg-laying, she said.

（CNN）—并不是在任何地方都必须戴口罩，但是捷克共和国甚至对裸体主义者都严格遵守戴口罩的规定。
警方在一份声明中说：“不幸的是，许多享受日光浴的公民聚集在一起，有的没有戴着口罩。”
“在警察到达后，每个人都同意遵守政府的规定（在住所外面必须戴防护面具）。
“允许公民在指定地点没有衣服，但他们仍然必须掩住嘴巴，只能以适当的人数聚在一起。”
声明说，随后的警察巡逻发现有150人遇到，只有一半需要提醒人们戴口罩。

(CNN) — Face masks aren't mandatory everywhere, but strict rules on wearing them have been enforced in the Czech Republic -- even for nudists.
"Unfortunately, many of the sunbathing citizens were gathered in large groups, and some were not wearing face masks.," a police statement said.
"Upon the arrival of the police, everyone agreed to respect the government regulation [that face shields are compulsory outside the home].
"Citizens are allowed to be without clothes in designated locations, but they still must cover their mouths, and only gather in appropriate numbers."
The statement said a subsequent police patrol found that of 150 people encountered, only half needed reminding about masks.

泰勒（Taylor）撰写了《人民的灵魂：WPA作家的计划揭示了美国的萧条》一书，该书也被改编成同名纪录片，记载了WPA的一个方面，即联邦作家计划。
WPA的“联邦艺术计划”，“联邦剧院计划”，“联邦音乐计划”和“历史记录调查”在整个文科领域雇用了美国人。
佐拉·尼尔·赫斯顿（Zora Neale Hurston）受联邦作家计划（Federal Writer'Project）聘请时创作了她的小说《他们的眼睛正在注视上帝》。
“我们不必像联邦作家计划那样从头开始。”
他说，艺术家创作的21世纪程序“不必看起来像WPA那样的大型整体程序。”

Taylor penned the book "Soul of a People: The WPA Writers' Project Uncovers Depression America," which was also turned into a documentary with the same title, chronicling one aspect of the WPA, the Federal Writers' Project.
The WPA's Federal Art Project, Federal Theatre Project, Federal Music Project and Historical Records Survey employed Americans across the liberal arts spectrum.
Zora Neale Hurston worked on her novel "Their Eyes Were Watching God" while employed by the Federal Writers' Project.
"We don't have to start from scratch like the Federal Writers' Project did."
A 21st century program from artists "wouldn't have to look like the big monolithic program the WPA was," he said.

旧金山（CNN商业）苹果公司与Google合作，帮助当局使用蓝牙技术跟踪冠状病毒的暴露情况。
两家公司将在5月份首先发布基于现有公共卫生应用程序构建的界面，这些界面可在iOS或Android系统上运行，随后在接下来的几个月中，用户将可以选择使用更全面的平台。
根据Google的解释，测试冠状病毒呈阳性的智能手机用户可以将其结果输入到公共卫生机构的应用程序中，该程序将输入匿名的“标识符信标”。
然后，该标识符将与用户也与启用了该服务的任何人进行匿名交换。
然后，用户将其标识符记录上传到云中，如果暴露给任何对该病毒呈阳性的人，他们将收到通知。

San Francisco (CNN Business) Apple and Google are partnering to help authorities track exposure to the coronavirus using Bluetooth technology.
The companies will first release interfaces built on existing public health apps in May that can work on iOS or Android systems, followed by a more comprehensive platform in the coming months to which users will be able to opt in.
A smartphone user that tests positive for the coronavirus can input their result into an app from a public health authority, which will feed into an anonymous "identifier beacon," according to an explanation from Google.
That identifier will then be anonymously exchanged with anyone the user comes into contact with who also has the service enabled.
Users then upload their identifier records to the cloud, following which they will receive a notification if they have been exposed to anyone who has tested positive for the virus.

Tennis players are not employees of any organization or governing body.
We cannot play club matches, which is the biggest income for lower-income tennis players outside of playing tennis and coaching."

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
后来空袭被认为是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

但是，美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）采访了包括帕特里夏（Patricia）在内的五名十几岁和二十多岁的女性，他们声称格拉瑟（Glaser）在Bery's Place对其进行了性和情感虐待。
当女孩们反对时，他们说格拉泽会威胁要把他们赶出去。
一些幸存者说，格拉瑟（Glaser）介绍自己是一名医生，但支持起诉的律师告诉美国有线电视新闻网（CNN），他是物理治疗师-不是合格的医生。
Dilen于去年2月在Bery's Place进行的一次警察突袭中因警察的讯问而被捕，后来被释放。
但至少现在，他们说他们开始在贝里故居之外享受生活。

But five women in their late teens and early twenties interviewed by CNN, including Patricia, allege that Glaser sexually and emotionally abused them at Bery's Place.
When the girls objected, they say Glaser would threaten to cast them out on the streets.
Some survivors say Glaser introduced himself as a doctor, but lawyers supporting the prosecution told CNN that he is a physiotherapist -- not a qualified physician.
Dilen was arrested for questioning by police last February during a police raid at Bery's Place, and later released.
But for now, at least, they say they're beginning to enjoy their lives outside of Bery's Place.

## 香港冠状病毒检疫营内的情况

### What it's like inside a Hong Kong coronavirus quarantine camp

假日营地变成了隔离营地-隔离饮食-温度检查和穿PPE的工作人员在隔离区生活-感觉像是在学校，营地和监狱中混合在一起。
我的工厂位于鲤鱼门公园，通常是香港岛东部一个绿树成荫的度假村。
这个假日公园是香港用作冠状病毒检疫中心的几处设施之一。
在此之前，我已经在家工作了三个月-因此，在隔离营中做同样的事情并没有多大区别。
但这证明了香港政府对遏制从海外进口的案件并推回本地自满情绪的重视程度。

Holiday camp turned quarantine campLife in quarantine -- with its regimented meals, temperature checks and PPE-wearing staff -- feels like an odd mix of being in school, at camp, and in prison.
My facility, in Lei Yue Mun Park, is normally a leafy holiday village in the east of Hong Kong Island.
This holiday park is one of several facilities being used as coronavirus quarantine centers in Hong KongSince March, that number has surged.
Prior to now, I'd already been working from home for three months -- so doing the same from a quarantine camp hasn't made much of a difference.
But it's a testament to how serious the Hong Kong government is about clamping down on cases imported from overseas, and pushing back on local complacency.
