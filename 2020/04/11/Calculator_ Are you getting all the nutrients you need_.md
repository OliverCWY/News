Many nutrients are involved in supporting the immune system to function normally. “There are no foods or supplements that can protect you from the (Covid-19) virus”, says Sarah Stanner, Science Director at the British Nutrition Foundation. But, she continues, “our diet does help support the immune system to cope with infections, and so anything we can do to try and eat well can help us get all the nutrients our body needs”.

So are there nutrients we should be especially careful to consume enough of ? “While vitamin C and zinc supplements may be flying off the shelves, it’s important to remember the other key players in the immune system”, says Stanner. Nutrients important for healthy immune function include vitamin D, and as we mostly get this from sunlight we may need to supplement it when self-isolating.

Other nutrients linked to a healthy immune system include vitamin A, which helps support T cells (a type of white blood cells that can help identify pathogens, which can cause disease), and vitamins B6, B9 (folate) and B12, which are important for producing new immune cells. Vitamin C helps the immune cells to attack pathogens, enables us to clear away old immune cells from the site of infection and has a role in maintaining skin – our barrier to infection. Iron is involved in maintaining healthy immune cells, while selenium and zinc help produce new immune cells and copper assists with protecting and fuelling immune cells.
