New film – Trolls World Tour

The first of this year’s big Hollywood films to be released online rather than in cinemas is this sequel to 2016’s Trolls, an animated Dreamworks musical which managed to be fluffy, glittery and garishly coloured without being deeply annoying. The new cartoon’s bonkers premise is that the Troll villagers are actually Pop Trolls, and that they’ve never noticed the Rock Trolls, Funk Trolls, Country Trolls and more living nearby. It’s up to the perky Queen Poppy (voiced by Anna Kendrick) and her cynical pal Branch (Justin Timberlake) to bring harmony to the tribes. Adults will predict exactly what is going to happen, but young children will love the fast-paced silliness and positive messages too much to care. Available to rent from Prime Video, iTunes, Microsoft Store, Sky Store, Google Play and Rakuten. (NB)

New TV – Run

The eternal dilemma of whether to text your ex is the catalyst for this superb new comedy-thriller, created by Vicky Jones, best friend and longstanding collaborator of Fleabag’s Phoebe Waller-Bridge, in which a thirtysomething woman receives a phone missive from a former flame, which leads her to ditch her comfortable suburban family life to take a cross-country train journey across America with him. With a witty and emotionally truthful script, and a wonderfully warm and instinctive lead performance from the utterly marvellous Merritt Wever (Unbelievable), it is one more thing to keep you gripped over the next couple of months. Premieres on HBO on Sunday in the US, and on Sky Comedy and NOW TV on Wednesday in the UK. (HM)

Theatre – Fleabag

And talking of Fleabag, the original stage version of the Emmy-winning comedy phenomenon about a mischief-making twentysomething with a scabrous view of life has now been made available to stream in aid of charities fighting the pandemic, as well as people who have been affected by it. Filmed during its run last year in London’s West End, it sees Waller-Bridge performing a virtuosic monologue as she brings to vivid life her titular anti-heroine and a whole gallery of supporting characters. Available now on Soho Theatre on demand in the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Canada and Amazon Prime in the UK and US. (HM)

Book – Funny Weather by Olivia Laing

Subtitled ‘Art in an Emergency’, this couldn’t be timelier – the formidable writer Olivia Laing’s defence of art during a turbulent time. Bringing together an eclectic range of essays covering artists including Jean-Michel Basquiat and Georgia O’Keefe, writers such as Hilary Mantel and Ali Smith, and themes like loneliness and technology, it makes the case for why art matters – and how it can offer ‘fertile new ways of living’. Out on Wednesday. (FM)

Book – Coronavirus: A book for Children

With input from headteachers, a child psychologist and a professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, this digital book is free to download (publishers Nosy Crow request that donations be made to the UK’s National Health Service in lieu of payment). Illustrated by Axel Scheffler (The Gruffalo), it answers questions about quarantine, lockdown and the virus for those aged between five and nine. Scheffler has also worked with children’s author Julia Donaldson to create panels showing some of her best-known characters – including The Gruffalo and Stick Man – practising social distancing and coming to terms with life in self-isolation. (FM)

Pop music

As a treat for fans in lockdown, indie favourites The National are digging out classic live sets, rarities and unseen footage from their archive every Monday at 5pm ET (10pm BST) – they’re also hoping to raise funds to support their crew. Other artists who are regularly live-streaming performances include Metallica, with \#MetallicaMondays, and Elbow with \#elbowrooms. For fans of festivals and music documentaries Coachella: 20 Years in the Desert premieres on YouTube on 10 April, the date the US festival was due to launch. (RL)

Classical music – Max Richter’s Sleep

Five years since its BBC Radio 3 premiere live in London, minimalist composer Max Richter’s epic eight-hour orchestral ‘lullaby for a frenetic world’ returns to the station, but this time also broadcast simultaneously in over 19 countries, encouraging listeners across Europe to relax, listen – and yes, even sleep – during this special event to unify nations in quarantine.

Composed in consultation with US neuroscientist David Eagleman, the landmark wordless composition of strings, piano, electronics and voice was written as “an invitation to pause our busy lives for a moment”. But as we face an involuntary pause, now feels the right time to immerse ourselves collectively in a glacially-paced moment of beautiful textures. Broadcasting Saturday 23:00-07:00 on BBC Radio 3 and across the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). More station details here.

Art

Last month British artist Gareth Fuller was in compulsory lockdown in China for 14 days, and during that time created the Quarantine and Pandemic Survival Map, which he has released with a free download option. It’s a light-hearted, remarkably intricate ‘map of the mind’, which aims to help people navigate the extraordinary time that we are all going through. It offers “well-meaning humour in these hard times,” says Fuller.

Australia’s National Gallery of Victoria, meanwhile, is launching a new four-part virtual series of its popular drop-by drawing programme. Audiences can watch a video tutorial, featuring tips and tricks from some of the state’s best-known contemporary artists, including Lily Mae Martin, Kenny Pittock and Minna Gilligan. Taking inspiration from some of their works in the gallery’s collection, the classes aim to encourage the “mindful and therapeutic” activity of drawing. (LB)

Classic film – Bridesmaids (2011)

Remember how Bridesmaids was meant to set off a wave of comedies starring women? In fact, the number of comedies starring either women or men has dwindled, which makes this heartfelt, raucous and snort-out-loud funny tribute to female friendship all the more precious. Kristen Wiig stars as Annie, a Milwaukee baker who loses the one good thing in her crumbling life when her engaged BFF Lillian (Maya Rudolph) sidelines her in favour of the practically perfect Helen (Rose Byrne). Another cheering aspect of rewatching this is that Wiig and her co-writer, Annie Mumolo, have at long last scripted another comedy, Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar, which is due to come out in late-July. Fingers crossed. Available on Prime Video, Google Play, YouTube, Apple TV, Rakuten and Chili. (NB)

Classic TV – Red Dwarf

These days, Craig Charles hosts an excellent funk and soul show on BBC 6 Music – which incidentally is great for parties, when they still existed – but back in the 1990s, he starred in British sci-fi comedy Red Dwarf as Dave Lister: the last-known human alive, who managed to survive by being held in suspended animation at the time of a deadly radiation leak.

Set in deep space on a mining ship sometime in the 22nd Century, it followed the trials and tribulations of Lister and his crewmates including: a hologram of Arnold Rimmer (Chris Barrie), his deceased bunkmate, resurrected by senile on-board computer Holly to keep him sane; Cat (Danny John-Jules), who evolved from the descendants of pet cat Frankenstein; Service mechanoid Kryten (Robert Llewellyn), whose face is the butt of many jokes; and Kristine Kochanski, an alternative-reality version of Lister’s love interest. In the confined space of the ship, cooped up with a handful of people driving each other up the wall, it’s a surreal setting that couldn’t be more relevant to life as we know it now. Streaming on Britbox, Now TV/Sky, Amazon Prime Video and Netflix. (EM)
