People in the UK are being urged to resist visiting their local beach or park despite the warm weather.

Temperatures are expected to reach as high as 26°C (78.80°F) in some areas.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Breakfast: "It's too early to lift the [social-distancing] measures and people need to stay at home."

He added: "There will be a wide debate... about the extent of the measures and how long they're going to be in place for, but what I can tell you is that now it is absolutely vital that people stay at home and follow the social distancing measures."

This week, South Yorkshire Police apologised after a "well-intentioned but ill-informed" officer told a family not to play in their own front garden .

Mike Cunningham, chief executive of the College of Policing, told the BBC this morning: "What we're dealing with here is the issue of officers applying discretion."

He added: "Very often, in the vast majority of cases, they get that right - they apply discretion sensitively, carefully and with wisdom. And in some cases they get it wrong."
