BEIJING (CHINA DAILY/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Starting on Sunday (April 12), travellers who arrive in Beijing will be required to provide negative coronavirus test results when they check in to hotels in the capital, under a new measure announced on Friday.
Mr Zhou Weimin, a senior official at the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Tourism, said the authorities will strengthen control and management of people who come to Beijing and stay in hotels to avoid any loopholes.
Hotels will require guests to provide a national health clearance and a Beijing's health condition app, with both showing "normal".
Guests should also provide information about their contacts in Beijing and accept the health management requirement of the hotels.
Mr Zhou spoke during a daily news conference on Friday about Beijing's efforts against the epidemic.

伦敦（路透社）-卫生部长马特·汉考克（Matt Hancock）周六（4月11日）表示，英国尚未达到Covid-19高峰，这将允许放松严格的行动限制。
我们还没有看到足以说出我们已经达到顶峰的水平。”他对BBC电台说。
一些科学家认为，高峰期可能还要过几个星期，但汉考克表示，“没人知道”何时会达到高峰。
在Covid-19呈阳性后死亡的包括19名医疗保健工作者，其中包括11名医生。
汉考克先生说，已经向为国家卫生局工作的140万员工运送了7.61亿件个人防护装备，但是在确保这些物品到达前线方面存在问题。

LONDON (REUTERS) - Britain has not yet reached the Covid-19 peak which would allow for an easing of tight restrictions of movement, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Saturday (April 11).
We haven't seen a flattening enough to be able to say that we've reached the peak," he told BBC radio.
Some scientists have suggested the peak might still be some weeks off but Mr Hancock said "nobody knows" when it would be.
Among those to have died after testing positive for Covid-19 are 19 health care workers including 11 doctors.
Mr Hancock said 761 million PPE items had been delivered to the 1.4 million staff who worked for the National Health Service but there were issues in ensuring the items reached the frontline.

由于中国的反对，台湾不是世界卫生组织的成员，中国声称台湾为自己的岛屿，并认为台湾无权加入国际组织。
陈先生在阅读电子邮件时说：“今天的新闻资源表明，在中国武汉至少报告了七例非典型肺炎病例。”

但是，台湾怀疑来自中国的信息不准确，因此已于12月31日开始筛选来自武汉的入境者。
它还于1月2日启动了紧急行动中心，专家表示，该中心可以有效控制病毒的早期传播。

Taiwan is not a WHO member, because of objections from China, which claims the island as its own and deems it to have no right to membership of international bodies.
"News resources today indicate that at least seven atypical pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan, China," Mr Chen said, reading the e-mail.

However, Taiwan, suspicious that information emerging from China was not accurate, had begun screening arrivals from Wuhan on Dec 31.
It also activated its emergency operations centre on Jan 2, which experts say allowed it to effectively control the early spread of the virus.

巴黎（法新社）-第一名因新型冠状病毒而正式死亡的人是1月9日来自武汉的61岁中国男子。
在过去八天中，记录的死亡人数比前84天多。
在193个国家/地区登记了160万起已申报的案件，其中至少335,900被认为已追回。
法国流行病学家凯瑟琳·希尔（Catherine Hill）说：“所有指标都有问题，但病例数在很大程度上取决于检测的数量。”
截至格林尼治标准时间1900，星期五，全球案件总数已超过美国的28％-486,490。

PARIS (AFP) – The first person to officially die from the novel coronavirus was a 61-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan on Jan 9.
In the last eight days, more deaths were registered than in the preceding 84 days.
More than 1.6 million declared cases have been registered in 193 countries, of which at least 335,900 are considered recovered.
“There are problems with all the indicators, but the number of cases depends a lot on the number of tests,” said French epidemiologist Catherine Hill.
More than 28 per cent of the global number of cases have been registered in the US – 486,490 as of 1900 GMT on Friday.

首尔-韩国在星期六（4月11日）说，违反隔离令的人将被要求佩戴跟踪腕带。
这是在发现许多人违反了自我检疫规则之后得出的。
联合通讯社引述钟汉忠的话说：“经过深思熟虑，政府已决定将电子腕带戴在违反自我隔离规则的人身上，例如不经通知就出门，不接电话等。”
但是，该国没有法律强迫被检疫的人戴上腕带。
韩国疾病预防控制中心（KCDC）表示，希望受到检疫人员的“积极合作”。

SEOUL - South Korea on Saturday (April 11) said people who violate quarantine orders will be required to wear tracking wristbands.
This comes after a large number of people were found to have contravened self-quarantine rules.
"After deep consideration, the government has decided to put electronic wristbands on people who violate self-isolation rules, such as going outside without notice and not answering phone calls," Yonhap news agency quoted Mr Chung as saying.
However, there are no laws in the country to compel those under quarantine to wear the wristbands.
The Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said it expects "active cooperation" from those under quarantine.

旧金山公共卫生局局长格兰特·科尔法克斯博士说，该市在周三和周五再次对收容所的居民进行了测试。
纽约拥有美国最大的无家可归人口，已经在数十个庇护所中发现了冠状病毒病例。
当局说，在洛杉矶县，至少有十几名无家可归的人对该病毒呈阳性反应。

SAN FRANCISCO (NYTIMES) - Seventy people at San Francisco's largest homeless shelter have tested positive for the coronavirus, Mayor London Breed said on Friday (April 10).
The outbreak, which included two shelter employees, is the largest reported at a single shelter in the United States.
Dr Grant Colfax, the director of the San Francisco Department of Public Health, said the city tested residents of the shelter on Wednesday and again on Friday.
New York City, which has the country's largest homeless population, has identified coronavirus cases in dozens of shelters.

华盛顿（法新社）-一项对来自Covid-19病房的医院病房进行空气采样的新研究发现，该病毒可以传播至4m，是现行指南规定人们应该在公共场所之间相互离开的距离的两倍。
他们发现病毒最集中在病房的地板上，“也许是由于重力和空气流动导致大多数病毒液滴漂浮到地面上”。
研究小组写道：“此外，ICU医护人员鞋底的一半样本呈阳性。”
“因此，医务人员鞋底可能充当载体。”
作者写道，令人鼓舞的是，没有医院工作人员被感染，“表明适当的预防措施可以有效地预防感染”。

WASHINGTON (AFP) - A new study examining air samples from hospital wards with Covid-19 patients has found the virus can travel up to 4m - twice the distance current guidelines say people should leave between themselves in public.
They found that the virus was most heavily concentrated on the floors of the wards, "perhaps because of gravity and air flow causing most virus droplets to float to the ground".
"Furthermore, half of the samples from the soles of the ICU medical staff shoes tested positive," the team wrote.
"Therefore, the soles of medical staff shoes might function as carriers."
Encouragingly, no members of the hospital staff were infected, "indicating that appropriate precautions could effectively prevent infection", the authors wrote.

华盛顿（法新社）-巴拉克•奥巴马（Barack Obama）先生在数千名狂喜的支持者面前庆祝了他的“历史性”白宫挑战赛的开始。
现年77岁的前副总统拜登（Biden）在他的唯一残余对手伯尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sanders）于周三退出比赛后，比奥巴马和克林顿夫人在民主党初选中取得了更快的胜利。
但是拜登先生一直在努力突破全国媒体的格局。
拜登先生希望得到奥巴马的认可，奥巴马在民主党中仍然很受欢迎，其罕见的公开政治声明具有重要的意义。
像特朗普先生一样，拜登先生也不是没有缺点。

WASHINGTON (AFP) - Mr Barack Obama celebrated the kickoff of his "historic" White House challenge before thousands of ecstatic supporters.
Mr Biden, the 77-year-old former vice-president, clinched victory in the Democratic primaries more swiftly than both Mr Obama and Mrs Clinton, after his lone remaining rival, Mr Bernie Sanders, quit the race on Wednesday.
But Mr Biden has struggled to crack through in the national media landscape.
Mr Biden expects to earn the endorsement of Mr Obama, who remains very popular among Democrats and whose rare public political pronouncements carry significant weight.
Like Mr Trump, Mr Biden is not without his faults.

这是因为前排人员产生的气流，也称为气流。
其中一位研究人员贝特·布洛克（Bert Blocken）教授解释说：“如果有人在散步，跑步或骑自行车时呼气，咳嗽或打喷嚏，大多数微滴就会被它们的尾流或滑流所夹带。
在支流中紧跟着这个领先者跑或骑自行车的另一个​​人，然后穿过那滴小水滴。”
但是那些走路，跑步或骑自行车的人要多加小心。”
您还应该只与家庭成员一起跑步，因为（您已经与他们接触过），”梁医生说。

This is because of the air currents produced by the person in the front, also known as a slipstream.
Professor Bert Blocken, one of the researchers, explained: "If someone exhales, coughs or sneezes while walking, running or cycling, most of the micro-droplets are entrained in the wake or slipstream behind (them).
The other person who runs or cycles just behind this leading person in the slipstream then moves through that cloud of droplets."
But those who go walking, running or cycling should be a bit more careful," said Prof Blocken.
You should also run only with your household members, because (you've already been exposed to them)," said Dr Leong.
