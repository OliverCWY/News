卫生部长马特·汉考克（Matt Hancock）在接受BBC早餐采访时说：“现在取消（社会隔离）措施还为时过早，人们需要留在家里。”
本周，南约克郡警察道歉，原因是一名“意图良好但消息灵通的”警察告诉一家人不要在自己的前花园玩耍。
警务学院首席执行官迈克·坎宁安（Mike Cunningham）今天早上对英国广播公司（BBC）表示：“我们在这里要处理的是军官运用自由裁量权的问题。”
他补充说：“在大多数情况下，他们常常做到这一点-他们敏感，谨慎，明智地运用酌处权。

Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Breakfast: "It's too early to lift the [social-distancing] measures and people need to stay at home."
This week, South Yorkshire Police apologised after a "well-intentioned but ill-informed" officer told a family not to play in their own front garden .
Mike Cunningham, chief executive of the College of Policing, told the BBC this morning: "What we're dealing with here is the issue of officers applying discretion."
He added: "Very often, in the vast majority of cases, they get that right - they apply discretion sensitively, carefully and with wisdom.

“我们有点天真，认为这只会持续两周，”拉卢克说。
不过，拉卢克说，她希望他们愿意尝试同居赌博，并说她能理解为什么其他新婚夫妇决定着手研究新事物。
但是，其他人可能会“否认”他们的真实感受，他们选择了“他们认识的在正常情况下不应该再约会的人”。
但是隆德奎斯特（Lundquist）认为，在当前的形势下，与不合适的长期合作伙伴搭档不一定是一件坏事。
他说：“我认为，对于许多人来说，孤立非常可怕……所以每个人都需要做自己想做的事情来解决这个问题。”

“We were a bit naive thinking it would only last two weeks,” says Laluque.
However, Laluque says she wishes they’d taken the gamble of trying out cohabiting and says she can understand why other new couples decided to rush into things.
Others, however, may be “in denial” about their true feelings, having settled for “someone they knew under normal circumstances they shouldn't have gone on a fourth date with”.
But Lundquist believes shacking up with an unsuitable long-term partner isn’t necessarily a bad thing in the current climate.
“I think for many, isolation is pretty terrifying... so everybody needs to do what they need to do to get through this,” he says.

世界卫生组织负责人警告说，西班牙各地取消了复活节庆祝活动，鼓励人们进行远程崇拜。过早采取冠状病毒封锁措施可能会引发感染的“致命复苏”。
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus博士表示，即使有些国家在经济影响方面挣扎，各国也应对放松限制保持谨慎。
欧洲受灾最严重的国家（西班牙和意大利）都放松了一些措施，而封锁仍在继续。
他说：“过快地解除限制可能导致致命的死灰复燃。”

Europe's worst hit countries, Spain and Italy, are both relaxing some measures, while their lockdowns continue.
"Lifting restrictions too quickly could lead to a deadly resurgence," he said.
How are Spain and Italy easing curbs?

为什么我们不能解除锁定？
如果我们只是解除锁定，那么不可避免地会爆发另一场爆炸。
病毒的基本原理也没有改变-一个被感染的人会在没有锁定的情况下平均将其传播给另外三个人。
但这也是解除当前限制的机会，而不会导致案件激增。
可以取消哪些锁定措施？

Why can't we just lift lockdown?
If we just lift the lockdown, then another explosive outbreak is inevitable.
The fundamentals of the virus have not changed either - one person infected will, without a lockdown, pass it onto three others on average.
But it is also an opportunity to lift some of the current restrictions without leading to a spike in cases.
Which lockdown measures could be lifted?

石油生产国欧佩克及其盟国周四宣布了创纪录的减产计划，但在墨西哥对减产感到不满之后，该计划遭到质疑。
墨西哥后来表示，由于与美国达成了帮助削减关税的协议，他们将继续前进。
美国总统唐纳德·特朗普说，他已提议“帮助墨西哥”。
洛佩兹·奥夫拉多尔先生说，美国每天将进一步削减石油产量25万桶，使墨西哥仅削减10万桶。
FXTM货币策略和市场研究全球负责人Jameel Ahmad说，减产“不是最终的答案”。

Oil producers group Opec and allies on Thursday announced the record supply cut, but the plans were cast in doubt after Mexico baulked at the cuts.
Mexico later said they would move forward, thanks to a deal with the US to help shoulder the reductions.
US President Donald Trump said he had proposed to "help Mexico along".
Mr Lopez Obrador said the US would make 250,000 barrels per day in additional cuts to its oil output, allowing Mexico to cut just 100,000.
Jameel Ahmad, global head of currency strategy and market research at FXTM, said the production cut "is not the ultimate answer".

零售巨头亚马逊表示，它将建立自己的冠状病毒测试实验室，以监控员工的健康状况。
该公司表示，已经组建了一个团队来建立自己的“增量测试能力”。
亚马逊员工此前曾批评该公司对冠状病毒大流行的反应。
3月，亚马逊解雇了一名纽约仓库工人，该工人组织抗议该公司缺乏安全预防措施。
该公司承认测试资源有限，因此它组建了一支员工团队来开发自己的设备。

Image copyright Hardy Wilson/AmazonRetail giant Amazon says it will build its own coronavirus testing lab to monitor the health of its staff.
The company said it had assembled a team to build its own "incremental testing capacity".
Amazon staff have previously criticised the firm over its response to the coronavirus pandemic.
In March, Amazon fired a New York warehouse worker who organised a protest over a lack of safety precautions taken by the company.
The company acknowledged that testing resources were limited, so it had assembled a team of employees to develop its own facility.

总的来说，我们的房屋和后院是一个“城市矿山”，里面装满了这些等待挖掘的重要材料。

因此，将其更多地视为将您的ard积物整理成整齐的堆放，以便以后回收的机会。

If you need a little extra motivation for the spring clean, though, there’s probably treasure hidden in there.
Locked inside the old products we hoard in dusty corners are valuable metals and minerals.

Each of these contains copper, silver and even gold, along with a wide range of valuable rare earth elements.
So, view this more as an opportunity to sort your hoard into neat piles, for recycling later.

You’ve probably noticed how some of your colleagues take to leadership roles like a duck to water.
It couldn’t be more different for others: bossing around people feels awkward, and a nagging self-doubt shadows every decision.
If you’re in the latter group, you might wonder why the thought of being a leader fills you with dread, and why you find it so hard to even see yourself as a manager.
If your parents were shrinking violets, the odds are increased that you will be too.
And key here is the way your parents behaved toward you.

## 红海的超级珊瑚

### The super-corals of the Red Sea

世界各地的其他珊瑚通常不具有相同的生物生存能力。
按照这个速度，到2100年，红海礁石可能是最后的礁石之一。
当Fine和研究小组将硝酸盐，铵盐和磷酸盐等营养物质引入实验时，珊瑚的生理机能受到损害，它们不再具有弹性。
芬说：“仅靠温度是不够的。”
“如果我们要确保亚喀巴湾和北部红海成为珊瑚礁的避难所，我们就必须消除当地的压力。”与Fine，Meibom和其他几位科学家和外交官一道，Kleinhaus呼吁联合国教科文组织宣布红海礁作为海洋世界遗产，以帮助确保该礁得以持久存在，并受到保护，免受当地威胁，否则可能会损害珊瑚的复原力。

Other corals around the world don’t typically possess the same biological ability to persist.
At this rate, the Red Sea reefs could be one of the last standing by the year 2100.
When Fine and the team introduce nutrients such as nitrate, ammonium and phosphate into the experiments, the corals’ physiology is compromised and they’re no longer as resilient.
“It’s not enough to be resilient to temperature,” Fine says.
“If we are to secure the Gulf of Aqaba and the northern Red Sea as a coral reef refuge, we have to remove the local stress.”Along with Fine, Meibom, and several other scientists and diplomats, Kleinhaus is calling on Unesco to declare the Red Sea reef as a Marine World Heritage Site, to help ensure that the reef persists and will be protected from local threats that could otherwise compromise the coral’s resilience.

在1945年至1989年之间，波兰各地的城镇和村庄建立了3,000座教堂。
这些教堂既没有法律禁止，也没有被禁止，这些教堂-其中许多看起来像是从外太空到达的，令人大跌眼镜-对于建筑师来说是天赐之物。
“建立一个建筑实践是不可能的，”《天七建筑》（Day-VII Architecture）一书的合著者伊扎贝拉·西乔斯卡（IzabelaCichońska）解释说，这些书对这些教堂进行了分类。
他设计了三座教堂，包括波兰女王格洛夫（Glogów）的圣母玛利亚教堂。
尽管这些教堂中最好的教堂在视觉上大饱眼福，但它们的建筑也许比其设计更为独特。

In towns and villages across Poland, 3,000 churches were built between 1945 and 1989.
Neither legal nor prohibited, these churches – many of them eye-popping edifices that look as if they’ve arrived from outer space – were a godsend for architects.
“It was impossible to set up an architectural practice,” explains Izabela Cichońska, co-author of the book Day-VII Architecture, that catalogues these churches.
He designed three churches including Glogów’s Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Queen of Poland.
Despite the visual feast that the best of these churches represents, their construction is perhaps even more extraordinary than their design.

许多营养物质参与支持免疫系统正常运作。
但是，她继续说：“我们的饮食确实有助于支持免疫系统以应对感染，因此，我们可以尽一切努力尝试饮食，可以帮助我们获取人体所需的所有营养。”
对于健康的免疫功能而言重要的营养物质包括维生素D，而且由于我们大多是从阳光中获取维生素D，因此在自我隔离时可能需要补充维生素D。
维生素C帮助免疫细胞攻击病原体，使我们能够清除感染部位的旧免疫细胞，并在维护皮肤（我们的感染屏障）中发挥作用。
铁参与维持健康的免疫细胞，硒和锌有助于产生新的免疫细胞，铜有助于保护和促进免疫细胞的生长。

Many nutrients are involved in supporting the immune system to function normally.
But, she continues, “our diet does help support the immune system to cope with infections, and so anything we can do to try and eat well can help us get all the nutrients our body needs”.
Nutrients important for healthy immune function include vitamin D, and as we mostly get this from sunlight we may need to supplement it when self-isolating.
Vitamin C helps the immune cells to attack pathogens, enables us to clear away old immune cells from the site of infection and has a role in maintaining skin – our barrier to infection.
Iron is involved in maintaining healthy immune cells, while selenium and zinc help produce new immune cells and copper assists with protecting and fuelling immune cells.
