There are at least 501,615 cases of coronavirus in the US and at least 18,777 people have died in the US from coronavirus, according to a Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases in the United States.

The totals includes cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other U.S. territories, as well as all repatriated cases.

Wyoming is the only state that is not reporting a death from coronavirus.

Officials warn of risk of ending social distancing measures: If the US ends social distancing and other coronavirus mitigation strategies by May 1, as President Donald Trump has encouraged, case numbers in the country could rebound, officials warned.

The projections are based on new modeling scenarios run by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington that assume social distancing policies will end from next month.

"The risk of rebound is very great," IHME Director Dr. Chris Murray told CNN late Friday.

"If we were to stop at the national level May 1st, we're seeing (in models) a return to almost where we are now sometime in July, so a rebound ... Definitely there's a very substantial risk of rebound if we don't wait to the point where most transmission is near zero in each state."

The research center plans to release state-level analyses based on the new models next week, Murray said.

The warning comes after Trump said he wanted to reopen the country's economy, despite many researchers and medical staff saying it's far too early for such a move.
