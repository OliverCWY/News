但是一些分析人士认为，在南中国海，即使是短期的撤退也可以创造出解放军可以利用的机会。
许多分析家指出，由于南中国海的紧张局势，越南似乎越来越靠近美国。
但是，由于罗斯福在关岛被无限期隔离，目前尚不清楚在南海角色中更换罗斯福有多容易。

华盛顿代理海军大臣托马斯·莫迪（Thomas Modly）周二辞职，就在泄漏的音频透露他在致船员致辞中称西奥多·罗斯福（USodore Roosevelt）被驱逐的司令“愚蠢”之后的第二天。
他们是解除我们国家，弥合鸿沟，使这个国家成为世界历史上最伟大国家的人。”莫德里在辞职信中写道。

莫迪写道：“我曾希望在逆境中传递爱，责任，使命和勇气的信息。”

Washington (CNN) Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly resigned on Tuesday, a day after leaked audio revealed he called the ousted commander of the USS Theodore Roosevelt "stupid" in an address to the ship's crew.
They are the ones who lift our nation, heal our divides, and make this country the greatest in the history of the world," Modly wrote in his resignation letter.
Secretary Modly served the nation for many years, both in and out of uniform.
Secretary Modly did that today, and i wish him all the best."
"I had hoped to transmit a message of love, and duty, and mission, and courage in the face of adversity," Modly wrote.

伦敦（CNN商业）WhatsApp试图通过对转发的消息可以同时共享的次数设置新的限制，来阻止冠状病毒错误信息的迅速传播。
新限制是WhatsApp迄今为止最严格的限制。
聊天应用程序已逐渐加强对其转发功能的限制，用户可以轻松地选择多个组或多个人来接收消息。
两年前，一个用户可以一次将转发的消息传递给250个群组，每个群组都可以托管数百个用户。
现在是一个，尽管从理论上讲用户仍然可以将同一条消息逐一转发给个人或组。

London (CNN Business) WhatsApp is trying to stem the rapid spread of coronavirus misinformation by placing new limits on the number of times a forwarded message can be shared simultaneously.
The new limits are WhatsApp's strictest yet.
The chat app has been gradually tightening the restrictions on its forwarding function, where a user can easily choose multiple groups or people to receive the message.
Two years ago, a user could pass on a forwarded message to 250 groups at once, with each group capable of hosting hundreds of users.
Now it's one, although a user could theoretically still forward the same message to individuals or groups one by one.

（CNN）伊利诺伊州的一位市长上周恳请居民注意该州的居家秩序。
伊利诺伊州奥尔顿市市长布兰特·沃克（Brant Walker）在周五的简报会上说：“这是非常严峻的时期，我恳请您待在家里。”
出席者中：沃克的妻子。
沃克周一在一份声明中宣布，警方已于周日凌晨1点左右违反伊利诺伊州全州范围的命令，调查并停止了一次社交聚会。
沃克在声明中说：“我指示警察局长对待她，就像对待任何违反“待在家里”命令的公民一样，并确保她没有受到特殊待遇。

(CNN) A mayor in Illinois pleaded with residents last week to follow the state's stay at home order.
"These are very serious times and I'm begging you to please stay at home," Brant Walker, mayor of Alton, Illinois, said in a briefing on Friday.
Among those in attendance: Walker's wife.
Walker announced in a statement on Monday that police had investigated and stopped a social gathering in violation of Illinois' statewide order around 1 a.m. on Sunday.
"I instructed the Police Chief to treat her as he would any citizen violating the 'Stay At Home' order and to ensure that she received no special treatment," Walker's statement read.

（CNN）别误会-美国最高法院的保守派法官现在正在做出可能影响11月大选结果的裁决。
几天后，美国最高法院的保守派法官与威斯康星州的共和党人站在一边，他们希望通过实质上保证民主党的选民投票率较低来保护州最高法院的席位。
托尼·埃弗斯（Tony Evers）甚至召集立法机构召开不成功的特别会议，以试图推迟初选。
最高法院的保守派成员也在影响人们在大选之前可以获取的信息。
3月，最高法院采取了前所未有的步骤，推迟了原定于3月31日举行的口头辩论，其中包括涉及努力获取特朗普财务记录的几起案件。

(CNN) Make no mistake -- the conservative justices on the US Supreme Court are making decisions now that could influence the outcome of the November election.
Just a few days later, conservative US Supreme Court justices sided with Republicans in Wisconsin who wanted to protect a state Supreme Court seat by essentially guaranteeing that there would be a depressed voter turnout on the Democratic side.
Tony Evers even called the legislature into an unsuccessful special session to attempt to delay the primary election.
Conservative members of the Supreme Court are also influencing the information people have access to in advance of the election.
In March, the Supreme Court took the unprecedented step of delaying oral arguments, scheduled for March 31 -- including several cases involving efforts to obtain Trump's financial records.

但是今天，由于世界上93％的人口生活在禁止冠状病毒旅行的国家中，运动场已经暂时达到平衡。
CNN Travel仅与Henley Passport Index（有时被称为“护照之王”）的创始人ChristianKälin进行了交谈。
卡林说，值得注意的是，护照指数是比较地缘政治影响力的有效但粗略的工具。
护照指数排名第一，美国排名第七，而国籍质量指数排名第一。
“超越我们的控制”，爱尔兰在护照指数上仅排名英国第六位，仅排名第六。

But today, with 93% of the world's population living in countries with coronavirus travel bans , the playing field has been temporarily leveled.
CNN Travel spoke exclusively with Christian Kälin, creator of the Henley Passport Index, who is sometimes known as "The Passport King."
Kalin says it's worth noting that the passport index is an effective but crude tool in comparing geopolitical clout.
1 in the Passport Index and the United States at No.7, but the Quality of Nationality Index places them at No.
'Beyond our control'Ireland is just one place above the UK on the Passport Index, at No 6.

奥地利周一表示，它将在复活节后逐步开始重新开设商店，成为欧洲第一个这样做的国家。
由于旨在遏制冠状病毒的措施的经济成本日益高涨，政府解释其计划的压力越来越大。
担心如果限制时间太长，可能会破坏食品供应和医疗保健规定。
弄错了可能导致更多的爆发，对工作和公共生活的另一轮限制以及更多的经济痛苦。
布莱尔说：“如果持续很长时间……它也会影响您有效运行医疗保健系统的能力。”

Austria on Monday said it would gradually begin to reopen shops after Easter, becoming the first country in Europe to do so.
Pressure is building on governments to explain their plans because of the mounting economic costs of measures designed to contain the coronavirus.
It's compounded by fears that food supplies and health care provisions could be undermined if the restrictions are in place for too long.
Getting it wrong could lead to more outbreaks, another round of restrictions on work and public life, and much more economic pain.
"If it goes on for a long period of time ... it also affects your ability to operate your health care system effectively," Blair said.

（CNN）科学家每天都在不断学习有关神秘的新型冠状病毒和Covid-19的症状的知识，Covid-19的症状是这种疾病。
在所有Covid-19病例中，绝大多数都发现有发烧，咳嗽和呼吸急促。
总的来说，“我认为我们对患者可能出现的症状类型有了更多的了解，”古普塔说。
根据美国耳鼻咽喉头颈外科学会的说法，“尤其是在最终检测出冠状病毒呈阳性而没有其他症状的患者中，尤其发现了厌食症。”
实际上，Covid-19的许多症状都可能类似于流感，包括头痛和先前提到的消化问题，身体疼痛和疲劳。

(CNN) Scientists are learning more each day about the mysterious novel coronavirus and the symptoms of Covid-19, the disease it causes.
Fever, cough and shortness of breath are found in the vast majority of all Covid-19 cases.
Overall, "I think we're getting a little bit more insight into the types of symptoms that patients might have," Gupta said.
"Anosmia, in particular, has been seen in patients ultimately testing positive for the coronavirus with no other symptoms," according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.
In fact, many symptoms of Covid-19 can resemble the flu, including headaches and the previously mentioned digestive issues, body aches and fatigue.

（CNN）一群志愿者一直在为田纳西州的孟菲斯一家与冠状病毒大流行作斗争的医院修复27,000个急需的N95防护口罩-他们在周末完成了大部分工作。
孟菲斯浸信会纪念医院最近发现有数十个口罩在存储中，但由于弹性带已干转而需要更换，因此无法使用。
组织者Stephanie Lepone和Ginna Rauls几乎是偶然地偶然进入了这项艰巨的工作。
Lepone说她全职做工程师，有三个孩子，但是她想在家隔离时做些帮助。
他们已经开始为儿科医生的办公室制作布口罩，而Lepone邀请一个朋友，他是浸信会纪念医疗所的负责人，看他们是否需要布口罩。

(CNN) A group of volunteers has been working to repair 27,000 desperately needed N95 protective masks for a Memphis, Tennessee, hospital battling the coronavirus pandemic -- and they got most of them done in a weekend.
Baptist Memorial Hospital-Memphis recently found dozens of cases of the masks in storage but couldn't use them because the elastic straps had dry-rotted and needed to be replaced.
It was a huge job that organizers Stephanie Lepone and Ginna Rauls stumbled into almost by accident.
Lepone said she works full time as an engineer and has three kids, but she wanted to do something to help while she's quarantined at home.
They had started making cloth masks for a pediatrician's office and Lepone asked a friend, who's a director at Baptist Memorial Health Care, to see whether they needed cloth masks.

但是，随着全市乃至整个加利福尼亚州的全职在家以阻止致命的冠状病毒爆发，洛杉矶的空气中发生了一些戏剧性的变化。
瑞士空气质量技术公司IQAir表示，周二，洛杉矶看到了世界上任何一个主要城市中最干​​净的空气，该公司还监控着全球城市的污染水平。

But with the city -- and the entire state of California -- under stay-at-home orders to stem the deadly outbreak of coronavirus, something dramatic has happened to the air in LA.
On Tuesday, LA saw some of the cleanest air of any major city in the world , according to IQAir, a Swiss air quality technology company which also monitors pollution levels in cities around the globe.
EPA data shows that in March of this year, the Los Angeles area experienced the longest stretch of "good" air quality since at least 1995.

(CNN) When the bullets rang out, 5-year-old Jordan Allen Jr. was on the balcony of his Houston apartment stuck at home because of social distancing and he and his father were making TikTok videos.
He died Monday, nearly a week after being struck by a stray bullet in the drive-by shooting, CNN affiliate KTRK reported.
Jordan was not the intended target, and there are still no known witnesses or suspects, according to the Houston Police Department.
Jordan's dad, Jordan Allen Sr., was playing with his son when he stepped away to grab him some juice.
"There were multiple casings found in the parking lot and several cars had damage from possible gunfire," police spokesperson Jodi Silva told CNN.

这对夫妇的发言人周二告诉美国有线电视新闻网，该组织将如何运作以及其支持的原因的更多细节将在“适当的时候”发布。
他们说，该组织的名字不是基于他们的儿子Archie Mountbatten-Windsor，而是希腊词“ Arche”，意思是“行动的源头”。

(CNN) The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have revealed plans to launch a charitable organization called Archewell.
Reports of the newly-named foundation emerged in the British newspaper, The Telegraph, which claimed the couple filed paperwork in the United States last month and are currently planning how best to run the charity and accompanying website.
Further details of how the organization will operate and what causes it will support will be released "when the time is right," a spokesperson for the couple told CNN on Tuesday.
The organization's name is not based on their son, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, but rather the Greek word "Arche," meaning "source of action," they said.

（CNN）—宾夕法尼亚州的“涂鸦公路”（Graffiti Highway）是一条废弃的道路，如今已成为非官方的旅游胜地，但到处都是卡车装满的泥土，以阻止闯入者。
Guarna告诉WNEP，拥有该物业的Pagnotti Enterprises出于责任问题和人们聚集在此的担忧而雇用了他们来覆盖“涂鸦公路”。
瓜纳对新闻社说：“我认为几周前那里发生了一场大火，人们刚刚开始起火。”
一位访客告诉WNEP，他在网上观看了参加聚会的人的视频。
Anthony Procopio对WNEP表示：“我认为业主已经受够了，并决定要把所有的东西都填满。”

(CNN) — Pennsylvania's "Graffiti Highway," an abandoned stretch of road that's become an unofficial tourist attraction, is being covered with truckloads of dirt to discourage trespassers.
Guarna told WNEP that Pagnotti Enterprises, which owns the property, hired them to cover the "Graffiti Highway" because of liability issues and concerns that large crowds were gathering there.
"I think a few weeks ago, there was a fire there, people just starting fires," Guarna told WNEP.
One visitor told WNEP that he'd seen videos online of people having parties.
"I'm assuming the owners got fed up and decided they were going to fill everything in," Anthony Procopio told WNEP.

法赫迪堡（Al Fahidi Fort）拥有迪拜博物馆，该博物馆提供了摩天大楼和购物中心之前的区域快照。
迈克尔·埃西（Michael Essey）是电影制片人，曾在迪拜电影公司（Dubai Film）工作，该公司的任务是使该市的博物馆上线。
迪拜博物馆是他在这座城市中的最爱。
虚拟参观国际博物馆理事会（ICOM）同意埃西（Essey）的观点，即没有比现在更合适的时间探索世界上的虚拟展览，这不足为奇。
迪拜360“这些虚拟游览活动绝大多数都是免费的，”费尔南德斯说。

The Al Fahidi Fort houses the Dubai Museum, which offers a snapshot of the region before the skyscrapers and malls.
Michael Essey is a film producer who works for Dubai Film, a company that was tasked with bringing the city's museums online.
The Dubai Museum is his favorite in the city.
Virtual visitsIt might come as no surprise that the International Council of Museums (ICOM) agrees with Essey's opinion that there's never been a more fitting moment to explore the world's virtual exhibits.

作为香港海洋公园的长期居民，盈盈和乐乐的父母可能即将来临。
动物园官员周一宣布，经过十年的自然交配尝试和“通过试验和学习”，两者终于成功了。
由于冠状病毒的爆发，公园自1月下旬开始对游客关闭。
新闻稿说：“自三月下旬以来，莹莹开始花更多的时间在水中嬉戏，而乐乐一直在其栖息地周围留下气味标记，并在该地区寻找莹莹的气味。”
根据海洋公园的数据，仅约有1800只大熊猫仍留在其自然栖息地中。

Parenthood might be around the corner for Ying Ying and Le Le, which are longtime residents of Ocean Park in Hong Kong.
Zoo officials announced Monday that after 10 years of attempts at natural mating, and "through trial and learning," the two have finally succeeded.
Due to the coronavirus outbreak, the park has been closed to visitors since late January .
"Since late March, Ying Ying began spending more time playing in the water, while Le Le has been leaving scent-markings around his habitat and searching the area for Ying Ying's scent," reads the press release.
There are only around 1,800 giant pandas that remain in their natural habitat, according to Ocean Park.

## 历史上最致命的空袭发生在二战期间的东京，您可能从未听说过

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
后来空袭被认为是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

## 木摩天大楼革命终于到来了吗？

### Has the wooden skyscraper revolution finally arrived?

Mjøstårnet的高度达到280英尺，于去年开放后成为世界上最高的木材建筑。
长期倡导和设计木制建筑的建筑师Michael Green表示，“现在有很多东西在融合。”
Or Framework是位于俄勒冈州波特兰的一座雄心勃勃的148英尺高的木塔，在去年因成本担忧而被取消之前，该塔被设定为美国最高的木塔。
考虑到在2018年之前，俄勒冈州成为美国第一个允许使用18层木制建筑的州，而在美国，没有任何地方允许任何超过6层的建筑物，这一决定意义重大。
该组织表示，除了担心森林砍伐外，洒水喷头不能有效防止烈焰扩散到木结构建筑中。

Reaching 280 feet in height, Mjøstårnet became the world's tallest timber building upon opening last year.
According to architect Michael Green, a longstanding advocate for -- and designer of -- wooden buildings, there are "a whole bunch of things converging right now."
Or Framework, an ambitious 148-foot-tall timber tower in Portland, Oregon, that was set to be the USA's tallest wooden tower before was canceled amid cost concerns last year.
The decision is significant given that, before 2018, when Oregon became the first US state to allow 18-story wooden buildings, nowhere in America permitted anything higher than six.
In addition to concerns about deforestation, the group says sprinklers are ineffective at preventing blazes from spreading through wood buildings.
