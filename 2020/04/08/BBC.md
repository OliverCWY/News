Mr Raab, who is deputising for the PM, said Mr Johnson was receiving standard oxygen treatment and was breathing without any assistance, such as mechanical ventilation or non-invasive respiratory support.
Speaking at Tuesday's Downing Street coronavirus briefing, Mr Raab said the prime minister was being monitored closely in critical care, as was usual clinical practice.
"And I'm confident he'll pull through, because if there's one thing I know about this prime minister, he's a fighter.
'Very clear directions'At the briefing, Mr Raab was also asked about whether his role deputising for Mr Johnson gave him full prime ministerial responsibility.

截至周一，纽约市监狱中的286名囚犯和331名工作人员的冠状病毒检测结果呈阳性。
纽约市监狱系统的暴发是整个美国惩教机构中最严重的一次，就像纽约州在该病毒进入美国以来在Covid-19总数和死亡总数方面领先全美一样。
州长透露，纽约一直是美国冠状病毒爆发的中心，在周一至周二的24小时内，死亡人数最多。

As of Monday, 286 inmates and 331 staffers in New York City's jails have tested positive for the coronavirus.
The outbreak in New York City's jail system is one of the worst at correctional facilities throughout the US, just as New York state leads the country in both total Covid-19 cases and deaths since the virus reached the US.
The governor disclosed that New York, which has been the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak in the US, saw its highest number of fatalities in a 24-hour period between Monday and Tuesday.
Tyson, of New York's Bronx borough, was the first inmate to die of Covid-19 at Rikers Island, one of New York's largest prisons.

据报道，希拉里·克林顿（Hillary Clinton）在竞选活动期间每天吃一个辣椒，以防患病。
同时，自从2013年不明智的“碧昂丝饮食”以来，辣椒仍然没有恢复，因为该饮食建议食用辣椒，枫糖浆，柠檬和水的混合物以减轻体重。

But recently, some spices have been unofficially promoted from everyday culinary staples to all-healing superfoods.
Hillary Clinton reportedly ate one chilli pepper a day while on the campaign trail in an attempt to ward off illness.
Meanwhile, cayenne pepper still hasn’t recovered since the ill-advised “Beyoncé diet” back in 2013, which suggested consuming a concoction of cayenne pepper, maple syrup, lemon and water to lose weight.
But do spices really add any health benefits to our food, or help us ward off illness?

州长曾试图将初选推迟到6月，但周一被州最高法院阻止。
威斯康星州是第一个以亲投票方式举行初选的州，因为在冠状病毒大流行期间，全民住宿令席卷了全美。
选举前夕，威斯康星州最高法院否决了州长托尼·埃弗斯（Tony Evers）的最后一刻行政命令，以暂停亲自投票。
但是，共和党议员立即将埃弗斯（Evers）（民主党人）带到州最高法院，保守派在该州拥有4-2多数席位。
特朗普总统在周二的白宫简报会上说，威斯康星州最高法院已做出正确的决定，允许该州进行初选。

The governor had tried to postpone the primary to June, but was blocked on Monday by the state Supreme Court.
Wisconsin is the first state to hold a primary with in-person voting since stay-at-home orders swept the nation amid the coronavirus pandemic.
On the eve of the election, Wisconsin's Supreme Court blocked Governor Tony Evers's last-minute executive order to suspend in-person voting.
But Republican lawmakers immediately took Mr Evers - a Democrat - to the state Supreme Court, where conservatives hold a 4-2 majority.
At a White House briefing on Tuesday, President Trump said the Wisconsin Supreme Court had made the right decision to allow the state's primary election to go ahead.

英国的``职位保留计划''可能在三个月内花费30-40亿英镑，是最初估计规模的三倍。
这就是为什么休假计划和其他政府支持计划尽快将现金拨到第一线如此重要的原因。”
该计划的成本取决于企业的承担程度和需要休假的时间。
如果没有这样的计划，大规模失业的经济和社会代价将远远超过这一数字。”

That's why it's so important that the furlough scheme and the other government support schemes get cash out to the front line as quickly as possible."
The cost of the scheme depends on firms' take-up and the length of time workers need to be furloughed for.
The economic and social cost of mass unemployment in the absence of such a scheme would be far, far greater."
"I'd also like to see former employers step up during this time of national emergency and rehire former employees using the furlough scheme, which has been specially designed to save peoples incomes during this period."

这家德国航空公司表示将退役40多架飞机，警告说它预计需求不会持续数年。
停放的飞机，虽然他说旅行需求在其他灾难和衰退之后已经反弹，但在健康风险减弱之前，他希望其他航空公司效仿汉莎航空。
汉莎航空说：“要完全取消全球旅行限制要花费数月的时间，要使全世界的航空旅行需求恢复到危机前的水平还需要数年。”
Aboulafia先生说，危机在某种程度上使汉莎航空加快了抛售旧式，燃油效率较低飞机的计划，其中汉莎航空称其中一些已经计划出售。
阿波拉菲亚先生说，这是一个很好的机会，“有一天有需求时，准备用更好的飞机对其进行重建。”

The German airline said it would de-commission more than 40 aircraft, warning that it does not expect demand to return for "years".
Parked aircraftWhile he said that travel demand has bounced back after other disasters and recessions, until the health risks abate he expects other airlines to follow Lufthansa's lead.
"It will take months until the global travel restrictions are completely lifted and years until worldwide demand for air travel returns to pre-crisis levels," Lufthansa said.
Mr Aboulafia said in part the crisis is allowing Lufthansa to accelerate plans to dump older, less fuel-efficient aircraft, several of which Lufthansa said were already scheduled to be sold.
It is a good opportunity to "prepare for rebuilding it with better aircraft one day when demand comes back," Mr Aboulafia said.

You’ve probably noticed how some of your colleagues take to leadership roles like a duck to water.
It couldn’t be more different for others: bossing around people feels awkward, and a nagging self-doubt shadows every decision.
If you’re in the latter group, you might wonder why the thought of being a leader fills you with dread, and why you find it so hard to even see yourself as a manager.
If your parents were shrinking violets, the odds are increased that you will be too.
And key here is the way your parents behaved toward you.

彼得，现年71岁，达林顿一世，铅笔，虽然我看上去很简单，但值得您惊奇和敬畏……如果您能够意识到我所象征的奇迹，便可以帮助拯救人类如此不幸地失去的自由。
正如上面引用的精彩论文《 I-Pencil》所描述的，甚至看似简单的物体（例如石墨铅笔）也来自世界各地成千上万的手。
如果我们完全诚实的话，我们所有人中可能都存在一些仇外心理，种族主义，性别歧视和偏执狂。
对于我们担心与我们不同的其他人（仇外心理）和他们的观点不宽容（偏执），这也是正确的。

Is bigotry in our DNA, a remnant of our fear of “the other” way back when that was necessary?
Peter, 71, DarlingtonI, Pencil, simple though I appear to be, merit your wonder and awe … if you can become aware of the miraculousness which I symbolise, you can help save the freedom mankind is so unhappily losing.
Even seemingly simple objects like a graphite pencil are the work of thousands of hands from around the world, as the wonderful essay I-Pencil, quoted above, describes.
If we are completely honest, there is perhaps a little bit of xenophobia, racism, sexism and bigotry deep within all of us.
This is also true for our fear of others who are different to us – xenophobia – and intolerance of their viewpoints – bigotry.

超大质量的黑洞将位于光盘的中心位置，距离发布黑洞的第一张图像已有一年，这一具有历史意义的突破背后的团队又有了新的印象。
这次我们看到了巨大的激发气体或等离子体射流的底部，它以接近光速的速度从另一个黑洞中尖叫出来。

但是在新的EHT图片中，我们可以解决该喷射流离开黑洞附近的细节。

The supermassive black hole will be somewhere at the disc's centreOne year on from publishing the first ever image of a black hole, the team behind that historic breakthrough is back with a new picture.
This time we're being shown the base of a colossal jet of excited gas, or plasma, screaming away from another black hole at near light-speed.

But in the new EHT picture, we can resolve detail close to the point where this jet leaves the black hole.
