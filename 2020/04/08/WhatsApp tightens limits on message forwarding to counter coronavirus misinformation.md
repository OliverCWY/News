London (CNN Business) WhatsApp is trying to stem the rapid spread of coronavirus misinformation by placing new limits on the number of times a forwarded message can be shared simultaneously.

Facebook FB A message received by a person on the-owned platform that has already been forwarded five times can now only be passed on to one chat at a time.

The new limits are WhatsApp's strictest yet.

The chat app has been gradually tightening the restrictions on its forwarding function, where a user can easily choose multiple groups or people to receive the message. Two years ago, a user could pass on a forwarded message to 250 groups at once, with each group capable of hosting hundreds of users.

By last year, the company had reduced that limit to five groups at a time. Now it's one, although a user could theoretically still forward the same message to individuals or groups one by one.
