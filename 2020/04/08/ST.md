安倍晋三强调说，日本城市并没有像外国城市那样处于封锁状态，公共交通仍在运行，而诸如银行，超级市场和邮局等基本服务仍在运营。
这七个县的总人口为5610万，约占日本1.26亿总人口的44.5％。
根据确诊病例的增长率等标准选择了七个县。
北海道于2月下旬单方面宣布紧急状态，而没有得到中央政府的任何投入，但也没有列入名单，因为它成功地遏制了该病毒的传播。
在紧急状态下，要求公众保持“自我约束”，避免不必要地外出。

Mr Abe stressed that Japanese cities are not under lockdown like that in foreign cities, with public transport still running and essential services like banks, supermarkets and post offices in operation.
These seven prefectures together are home to 56.1 million people, or about 44.5 per cent of Japan’s overall population of 126 million.
The seven prefectures were chosen on the basis of criteria like the rate of increase in confirmed cases.
Hokkaido, which made a unilateral state of emergency declaration in late February without any input from the national government, was also not on the list, having succeeded in curbing the spread of the virus.
With the state of emergency declaration, the public has been asked to exercise “self-restraint” and avoid going out unnecessarily.

伦敦-英国首相鲍里斯·约翰逊（Boris Johnson）在冠状病毒感染恶化后的一天多，仍处于重症监护状态。
约翰逊先生今年6月满56岁，之前没有任何医疗投诉。
然而，英国首相一直在努力降低体重。他显然体重超过100公斤，身高1.75m，使他成为严重超重的一类。
这一集证实了一种保密文化，这种文化常常掩盖了英国首相的真实健康状况。
约翰逊先生的发言人周二表示，总理的情况稳定，他保持良好的情绪。

LONDON - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains in intensive care, more than a day after his coronavirus infection worsened.
Mr Johnson, who turns 56 in June, has had no previous medical complaints.
The British Prime Minister has struggled, however, to keep his weight down; he apparently weighs over 100kg which, at a height of 1.75m, puts him in the seriously overweight category.
The episode confirms a culture of secrecy which often hides the true health condition of British prime ministers.
Mr Johnson’s spokesman said on Tuesday that the Prime Minister’s condition was stable and he remained in good spirits.

对印度恢复羟氯喹出口的最直接的要求来自美国，美国总统周一甚至警告印度，对禁止其出口的决定进行报复。
这种抗疟疾药物是几十年前开发的，但近几周已成为人们梦co以求的药品，因为它被认为可以有效治疗Covid-19。
他还于周六与莫迪先生进行了对话，敦促他释放该药以出口到美国。
印度的冠状病毒病例从3月15日的110例急剧上升到4月7日的4,421例。
MEA表示，允许对乙酰氨基酚和羟氯喹出口的决定是在对可能的要求进行“全面评估”之后进行的。

The most vocal demand for India to resume exports of hydroxychloroquine has come from the United States, whose president on Monday even warned India of retaliation over its decision to ban its export.
The anti-malaria drug was developed decades ago but has become a coveted pharmaceutical product in recent weeks as it is believed to be effective in the treatment of Covid-19.
He had also spoken to Mr Modi on Saturday, urging him to release the drug for export to the US.
Coronavirus cases in India have risen sharply from just 110 on March 15 to 4,421 on Apr 7.
The MEA has said the decision to permit export of paracetamol and hydroxychloroquine follows a “comprehensive assessment” of possible requirements.

泰国内阁周二（4月7日）批准了价值1.9万亿泰铢（合825亿新元）的一揽子经济措施，以减轻冠状病毒爆发的影响。泰国财政部长Uttama Savanayana表示。
Uttama先生说，在这1万亿泰铢的借款中，6,000亿泰铢将用于公共卫生工作和救济措施，其余的将用于重建经济和创造就业机会。
最新的措施是在最近采取了数十亿美元的刺激措施以应对冠状病毒对经济的冲击之后，经济正步入衰退。
他说，BOT还将设立一项价值4000亿泰铢的公司债券稳定基金，为那些在2020-2021年到期的高质量公司提供过渡性融资。
Veerathai说：“ BOT继续密切监视局势，并准备采取必要的进一步措施。”

BANGKOK (REUTERS, BLOOMBERG) - Thailand's Cabinet approved a package of economic measures worth 1.9 trillion baht (S$82.5 billion) on Tuesday (April 7) to alleviate the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, Finance Minister Uttama Savanayana said.
Of the one trillion baht borrowing, 600 billion baht will be for public health works and relief measures, and the rest for rebuilding the economy and job creation, Mr Uttama said.
The latest steps follow billions of dollars of stimulus measures recently introduced to cope with the impact of the coronavirus on the economy, which is heading into a recession.
The BOT will also set up a corporate bond stabilisation fund worth 400 billion baht to provide bridge financing to high-quality firms with bonds maturing during 2020-2021, he said.
"The BOT continues to closely monitor the situation and stands ready to take further steps as necessary," Mr Veerathai said.

在周日（4月5日）的新闻发布会上，台湾卫生部长陈世忠在他旁边放了一个电蒸锅。
FDA局长吴守美说：“我们提醒大家不要加水，因为这会损坏静电层。
她指的是三层医用口罩的中间层，可以过滤掉细菌。
对于患有呼吸道或慢性疾病的人以及到医院就诊的人，一次性使用口罩应丢弃。”
根据FDA官员和赖教授的说法，每个口罩在无效之前可以蒸三到五次。

At a press conference on Sunday (April 5), Taiwan's Health Minister Chen Shih-chung had an electric steamer placed next to him.
Said FDA director-general Wu Shou-mei: "We're reminding everyone not to add water, as this will damage the layer with static electricity.
She was referring to the middle layer of the three-ply medical masks, which filters out the bacteria.
For people with respiratory or chronic illnesses and those visiting hospitals, masks should be discarded after one use," Ms Wu added.
According to both FDA officials and Prof Lai, each mask can be steamed three to five times before becoming ineffective.

雅加达（雅加达邮报/亚洲新闻网）-当局周一（4月6日）表示，印尼首都雅加达已经成立了一个特别警察部门，以保护因害怕居民可能试图阻止丧礼而担心的冠状病毒受害者的埋葬。
一支由120人组成的强大雅加达小组在周末启动，将监视受害者的尸体，将他们的尸体从医院带到这座庞大城市中的两座墓地，那里的病毒尸体被用塑料包裹并迅速掩埋。
他补充说，任何阻碍医务人员或干扰墓葬的人都可能面临长达一年的监禁。
但是，如果他们不停止行动，我们将采取坚定的行动，将他们带到派出所。”
乔科（Jokowi）在周一的一次有限会议上说：“我要求对高危人群，医生及其家属，接受监视的人以及受监视的患者进行PCR和快速检测。”

JAKARTA (THE JAKARTA POST/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Indonesia's capital Jakarta has launched a special police unit to guard the burials of coronavirus victims over concerns that scared residents could try to block funerals, the authorities said on Monday (April 6).
Launched at the weekend, the 120-strong Jakarta team will watch over victims' bodies as they are taken from hospitals to two cemeteries in the sprawling city, where virus corpses are being wrapped in plastic and quickly buried.
Anyone blocking medical staff or interfering with burials could face up to a year in jail, he added.
But if they don't stop then we'll take firm action and bring them to the police station," he said.
"I have asked for people at high risk, doctors and their families, people under monitoring and patients under surveillance be prioritised in the PCR and rapid testing," Mr Joko, better known as Jokowi, said during a limited meeting on Monday.

马尼拉-总统罗德里戈·杜特尔特（Rodrigo Duterte）扩大了对菲律宾北部三分之一地区的为期一个月的封锁，菲律宾北部该国一半人口居住，因为这里的专家尚未确定冠状病毒大流行的全部影响。
他重申，在整个吕宋岛禁闭行动三周后，要判断菲律宾是否已经“拉平曲线”还为时过早。
政府的经济计划机构警告说，由于封锁，至少有一百万工人可能失业。
除其他外，它将向1800万低收入家庭提供5,000比索至8,000比索的补贴。
杜特尔特先生随后警告违规者，他的锁定措施可能会因造成麻烦而被枪杀。

MANILA - President Rodrigo Duterte has extended a sweeping, month-long lockdown over the northern third of the Philippines, where half the country's population live, as experts here have yet to ascertain the full impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
He reiterated that it was still too early to tell if the Philippines was already "flattening the curve", three weeks into the Luzon-wide lockdown.
The government's economic planning agency has warned that at least a million workers could lose their jobs because of the lockdown.
Among other things, it will provide 5,000 pesos to 8,000 pesos in subsidies to 18 million low-income families.
Mr Duterte later warned violators of his lockdown measures that they could be shot for causing trouble.

普特拉贾亚（星空/亚洲新闻网）-资深部长伊斯梅尔·萨布里·雅科布（Ismail Sabri Yaakob）周二（4月7日）表示，希望从海外归国的马来西亚人必须在五星级酒店进行检疫。
他说，即使那样，他们也只能选择在政府宪报刊登的酒店住宿。
针对在社交媒体上盛行的这一问题，拿督斯里·伊斯梅尔·萨布里（Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri）解释了为什么某些四星级和五星级酒店被列为隔离中心。
“大使馆已与我们联系，允许其代表在酒店被隔离，并将为外交官承担全部住宿费用。
他补充说，希望在检疫期内入住五星级酒店的马来西亚人将必须承担全部费用。

PUTRAJAYA (THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Malaysians returning from overseas who want to be quarantined at five-star hotels will have to bear the cost themselves, said Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob on Tuesday (April 7).
He said even then, they can choose to stay only at hotels gazetted by the government.
Responding to the issue, which went viral on social media, Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri explained why certain four- and five-star hotels are gazetted as quarantine centres.
"Embassies have approached us to allow their representatives to be quarantined at hotels and will bear the full cost of stay for their diplomats.
Malaysians who want to stay at five-star hotels during their quarantine period will have to fully bear the expenses, he added.

香港（法新社）-困在家里没有游客，没有太多其他事情要做，在躲避了十年的问题后，香港的一对大熊猫终于决定放行。
就像地球的一半一样，莹莹和乐乐之间只有彼此真正相伴，因为冠状病毒引起的封锁使客人无法进入主题公园。
但是，如果发生了受精，应颖最早可能在6月出现荷尔蒙波动和行为变化。
这一消息是一个罕见的好消息，因为香港正受到冠状病毒引起的衰退和行动限制。
许多Facebook评论者推测，人群的缺乏可能增强了Ying Ying和Le Le的信心。

HONG KONG (AFP) - Stuck at home with no visitors and not much else to do, a pair of pandas in Hong Kong finally decided to give mating a go after a decade of dodging the issue.
Like half the planet, Ying Ying and Le Le have only really had each other for company since coronavirus-caused lockdowns shut off the flow of guests to their theme park pad.
But Ying Ying might exhibit hormonal fluctuations and behavioural changes as early as June if fertilisation has occurred.
The announcement was a rare bit of good news as Hong Kong reels under a recession and movement restrictions caused by the coronavirus.
Many Facebook commenters speculated that the absence of crowds might have boosted Ying Ying and Le Le's confidence.

华盛顿（法新社）-总统唐纳德·特朗普周一（4月6日）宣布与美国制造业巨头3M达成一项协议，将在对外分配纠纷后提供数百万个口罩，以对抗冠状病毒大流行。
他说：“我们已经与3M达成了非常友好的协议，每月将再交付5550万个高质量的口罩。”
“在接下来的几个月中，我们将为我们的一线医护人员提供1.665亿口罩，因此3M传奇结束得非常愉快。”
一些批评家指责3M不爱国行为，因为它继续向其他国家出售N95防毒口罩。
该公司表示将继续向加拿大和拉丁美洲出售口罩。

WASHINGTON (AFP) - President Donald Trump on Monday (April 6) announced a deal with US manufacturing giant 3M to provide millions of face masks to combat the coronavirus pandemic after a dispute over foreign distribution.
"We have reached a very amicable agreement with 3M for the delivery of an additional 55.5 million high quality face masks each month," he said.
"We're going to be getting over the next couple of months 166.5 million masks for our frontline healthcare workers, so the 3M saga ends very happily."
Some critics accused 3M of unpatriotic behaviour because it continued to sell N95 respirator masks to other countries.
The company said it would continue to sell masks to Canada and Latin America.

发言人埃里克·梅默（Eric Mamer）在电视新闻发布会上说，欧盟委员会将制定集团整体战略的指导方针。
欧盟委员会一直在努力安排一种统一的欧盟方法，这反映出它对成员国的健康和警务政策缺乏发言权。
欧盟领导人对封锁所造成的经济损失越来越感到震惊。
在3月10日领导人的最后一次视频会议上，一位与会者说：“我们刚刚陷入封锁。
一位欧盟官员说，如果成员国开始“蓄意废除”封锁，这将构成问题。

The European Commission will set out guidelines for a bloc-wide strategy, spokesman Eric Mamer told a videolink news conference.
The European Commission has struggled to arrange a common EU approach, reflecting its lack of say over member states' health and policing policies.
EU leaders are becoming increasingly alarmed at the economic damage wreaked by the lockdowns.
At the leaders' last video conference on March 10, one participant said: "We have just slid into lockdown.
That, one EU official said, poses a problem if member states start to end their lockdowns "willy-nilly".

我通过其网站订购了两道菜-烤农场新鲜鸡肉（$ 11.95）和椰浆饭（Nasi Lemak Ayam Masak Merah）（$ 11.95）。
尽管如此，“烤农场新鲜鸡肉”还是美味的，肉中带有烟熏木炭味。
它搭配了健康的五谷米饭和美味的香蒜酱，以及蔬菜（例如西兰花，炒洋葱和樱桃番茄）中掺有牛至的橄榄油。
Nasi Lemak Ayam Masak Merah的吸引力较小。
对于较大的团体，Grain提供捆绑餐，价格从两个人的19.95美元到五个人的47.95美元不等。

I ordered two dishes through its website - Grilled Farm Fresh Chicken ($11.95) and Nasi Lemak Ayam Masak Merah ($11.95).
Still, the Grilled Farm Fresh Chicken was delicious, with the meat having a smokey charcoal flavour.
It came with healthy multi-grain rice and a nice pesto, as well as vegetables such as broccoli, sauteed onions and cherry tomatoes seasoned with oregano-infused olive oil.
The Nasi Lemak Ayam Masak Merah was less appealing.
For bigger groups, Grain offers bundle meals priced from $19.95 for two persons to $47.95 for five persons.
