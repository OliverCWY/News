马来西亚警方周六（4月4日）表示，有4万人参与了Covid-19感染链，其中包括与Tabligh群有关的人。
他说：“我们通过帮助该部确定最近参加了在斯里兰卡八打灵清真寺的集会的大约11,000个平躺成员来分析数据。
“从这些数据来看，该团队改进并使用了特定的方法来确定密切联系，旅行以及可能受到相关人员影响的人的网络。
他补充说，许多禁忌分子已经过筛查，并敦促公众不要批评或歧视他们。
他说，该团队还试图获取有关海外住民的信息，有关这些住民的详细信息将提供给移民局，以便他们返回时采取必要的行动。

KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysian police on Saturday (April 4) said 40,000 people are involved in a Covid-19 chain of infection, including those linked with the tabligh cluster, Bernama news agency reported.
"We analysed the data by helping the ministry to identify up to about 11,000 tabligh members who attended the assembly at the Sri Petaling Mosque recently.
"From this data, the team refined and used specific methods to identify the network of close contacts, travel and who might be affected by those involved.
He added many of the tabligh members had been screened and urged the public not to criticise or discriminate against them, Bernama reported.
He said the team was also trying to get information on tabligh members who were overseas, and details on them would be given to Immigration for necessary action to be taken upon their return.

卫生部在周六表示，SHN专用设施不仅提供酒店客房。
卫生部说：“因此，根据现有能力，我们已经优先考虑了来自这些特定国家的回返者的设施。”
它补充说，那些从其他国家返回的人可以在其居住地服役14天的SHN。
多部委特别工作组将继续监视动态且不断发展的Covid-19局势，并与私营部门密切合作以相应地调整我们的SHN设施的能力。

SINGAPORE - Singaporeans returning from Asean countries, France, India and Switzerland from 11.59pm on Sunday (April 5) will serve their 14-day stay-home notice (SHN) in hotels instead of in their own homes, the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced on Saturday.
On Saturday, MOH said the dedicated SHN facilities do not just provide hotel rooms.
"Therefore based on the current capacity, we have prioritised the facilities for returnees from these specific countries," said MOH.
Those returning from other countries can serve their 14-day SHN at their place of residence, it added.
The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will continue to monitor the dynamic and evolving Covid-19 situation, and work closely with the private sector to adjust our capacity of SHN facilities accordingly.

曼谷-在周五晚上发生骚动之后，泰国已禁止从星期六（4月4日）至星期一的所有入境旅客航班，其中有152名泰国国民抵达曼谷的素万那普机场，但拒绝接受国家检疫。
泰国民航局表示，该飞行禁令不适用于国家和军用飞机，紧急降落，人道主义，医疗和货运航班，旨在遏制冠状病毒的爆发。
总理巴育（Prayut Chan-o-cha）周四还下令“放慢行车速度”，直到4月15日。
在周五全国宵禁开始之前，高峰时段在街上看到的汽车少得多，这是一种不寻常的景象。
她还在做饭，甚至在宵禁之前，都只允许餐馆外卖和送货。

BANGKOK - Thailand has banned all incoming passenger flights from Saturday (April 4) to Monday, following a commotion on Friday night in which 152 Thai nationals arriving at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport refused to be put under state quarantine.
The flight ban, which does not apply to state and military aircraft, emergency landing, humanitarian, medical, and cargo flights, is aimed at curbing the coronavirus outbreak, according to the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand.
Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha on Thursday also ordered a “slowdown” of incoming travellers until April 15.
Prior to the start of the nationwide night-time curfew on Friday, much fewer cars were seen on the streets during rush hour, an unusual sight.
She is also cooking some meals, with restaurants only allowed to open for takeaways and deliveries even before the curfew.

该命令旨在遏制Covid-19在该国的蔓延，该国已经确认了近42,000例病例。
但是一些专家已经开始质疑，从长远来看，关闭经济是否会导致更多人丧生。
约翰逊先生在对新型冠状病毒检测呈阳性后一直处于自我隔离状态，他已邀请反对党领导人下周与医学顾问进行简报，其中包括工党新领导人基尔·史塔默。
他说：“作为党的领导人，我们有责任在国家紧急状态的这一时刻共同努力。”
另外，政府表示将释放被认为是低风险且在释放后数周之内的囚犯。

The order is designed to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the country, which has almost 42,000 confirmed cases.
But some experts have started to question whether the shuttering of the economy will cost more lives in the long run.
Mr Johnson, who has been in self-isolation after testing positive for the novel coronavirus, has invited opposition party leaders to a briefing next week with medical advisers, including the new leader of the Labour Party, Keir Starmer.
“As party leaders we have a duty to work together at this moment of national emergency,” he said.
Separately the government said it would free prisoners who were deemed to be low risk and were within weeks of release.

“第二天我再次戴眼镜，人们仍然感到震惊，因为他们认为女性戴眼镜是非常不自然的。
但是在我之后，其他女性广播公司也开始戴眼镜。”

More recently, she started wearing a men's suit with necktie in a nod to the 2008 biographical film Colette, which stars Keira Knightley as a feministic French novelist.
Meet Lim Hyun-ju, a media personality who dares to challenge social norms in technologically-advanced but ideologically-backward South Korea.
She was careful to sound out her colleagues first about wearing glasses, and no one, male or female, felt it would create problems.
"I wore glasses again the next day, and people were still shocked because they think it is very unnatural for women to wear glasses.
But other female broadcasters started wearing glasses too, after me."

新加坡-当病毒入侵人体时，疾病的发展通常取决于免疫系统对感染的反应方式。
大多数时候，免疫系统会产生保护性反应。
例如，如果免疫系统过度运转，它可能会刺激称为细胞因子的蛋白质的过度生产，从而引起炎症。
细胞因子是免疫系统的分子信使。
在这里研究三名Covid-19病人时，科学家发现病人的免疫系统在处理入侵病原体的方式上显示出明显的变化。

SINGAPORE - When a virus invades a body, the development of the disease is often determined by how the immune system reacts to the infection.
Most of the time, the immune system mounts a protective response.
If the immune system kicks into overdrive, for instance, it could stimulate the over-production of proteins called cytokines, which can cause inflammation.
Cytokines are molecular messengers of the immune system.
In studying three Covid-19 patients here, the scientists found that the patients' immune system showed marked changes in the way they dealt with the invading pathogen.

华盛顿（纽约时报）-特朗普政府正在利用朝鲜战争时期的法律将其重定向到3M在其他国家/地区生产的美国口罩，这是迫使北卡罗来纳州明尼苏达州公司切断海外口罩销售的激烈运动的一部分。 。
但是在这种情况下，政府正在援引法律，迫使3M将在海外工厂制造的口罩发送到美国，并停止出口该公司在美国制造的口罩。
一些贸易和法律专家担心，这些举动可能适得其反，并促使外国政府对发往美国的急需的医疗必需品采取镇压措施。
在星期五（4月3日）晚上，特朗普政府发布了一项行政命令，指示联邦紧急事务管理和卫生官员使用法律授权保存呼吸器，口罩和手术手套供家庭使用。

WASHINGTON (NYTIMES) - The Trump administration is using a Korean War-era law to redirect to the United States surgical masks manufactured by 3M in other countries as part of a heated pressure campaign to force the Minnesota company to cut off sales of surgical masks abroad.
But in this case, the administration is invoking the law to compel 3M to send to the US masks made in factories overseas and to stop exporting masks the company manufactures in America.
Those moves, some trade and legal experts fear, could backfire and prompt foreign governments to clamp down on desperately needed medical necessities destined for the US.
On Friday (April 3) evening, the Trump administration issued an executive order directing federal emergency management and health officials to use the law's authority to preserve respirators, surgical masks and surgical gloves for domestic use.

女子锦标赛没有年龄限制。

Olympic football is usually restricted to under-23 teams for the men's tournament, with three overage players allowed per team.
There is no age limit for the women's tournament.
This would effectively raise the age limit by one year, as requested by both South Korea and Australia.
It also recommended the postponement of the under-20 women's World Cup, due to be co-hosted by Panama and Costa Rica in August and September, and the under-17 women's World Cup in India, originally scheduled for November.
A decision the on the Futsal World Cup in Lithuania in September should be made by the end of this month, it said.

河内（路透社）-越南向一艘越南渔船沉没后，越南向中国提出了官方抗议。越南一艘渔船被一艘中国海上侦察船撞向有争议的南海诸岛附近。
越南渔业协会在其网站上发表的一份声明中说，所有渔民都被中国渔船还活着，并转移到附近的另外两艘越南渔船上。
越南和中国多年来一直卷入一场潜在的能源丰富的争端中，越南称之为东海。
这起事件标志着越南渔船在不到一年的时间内第二次被中国渔船附近的中国渔船击沉。
去年，一艘中国石油调查船在越南控制的水域进行了超过三个月的作业，导致两国船只之间的紧张对峙。

HANOI (REUTERS) - Vietnam has lodged an official protest with China following the sinking of a Vietnamese fishing boat it said had been rammed by a Chinese maritime surveillance vessel near islands in the disputed South China Sea.
All the fishermen were picked up by the Chinese vessel alive and were transferred to two other Vietnamese fishing vessels operating nearby, the Vietnam Fisheries Society said in a statement posted to its website.
Vietnam and China have for years been embroiled in a dispute over the potentially energy-rich stretch of water, called the East Sea by Vietnam.
The incident marks the second time in less than a year a Vietnamese fishing vessel has been reportedly sunk by a Chinese vessel near the China-controlled Paracels.
A Chinese oil survey vessel conducted operations in Vietnamese-controlled waters for more than three months last year, causing a tense stand-off between vessels from the two countries.
