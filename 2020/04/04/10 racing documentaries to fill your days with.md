Video of Road - Official Trailer

The blurb: “Road is the heartbreaking and adrenaline-fuelled tale of a family who have dominated road racing for over thirty years.”

What we say: One of the very best motorsport documentaries out there, with Liam Neeson on narration duties to attest to its calibre. It’s all the more poignant since one of its stars – William Dunlop – passed away competing in the sport he loved in 2018, but Road does a sublime job of portraying just why he and his ilk end up so dangerously addicted to racing away from the health and safety of regular circuits.
