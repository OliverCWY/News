"I think it's difficult to give a particular explanation as to why any particular part of the country has a higher rate at any one time," NHS England Director Stephen Powis said, when asked about the 47% rise in hospital admissions in the Midlands. There has also been a 35% increase in hospital admission rates in Yorkshire and the North East but a slight fall reported in London.

He added that "perhaps unsurprisingly, London is a major urban centre [and] has an infection rate which is maybe a week or so ahead of the rest of the country".

He noted that it was normal for different areas of the country to experience different rates of infections during outbreaks, including with influenza in a normal year.
