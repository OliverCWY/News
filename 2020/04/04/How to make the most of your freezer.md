Wrapping food well and eliminating exposure to air will help keep its flavour and texture. It’s tempting to throw a packet from the supermarket into the freezer, but you may get better results from rewrapping the food so there’s minimum of exposure to air. If you’re storing food in a resealable bag, seal the bag almost completely and then use a straw to suck out any air (don’t do this with raw meat, though\!).

By using freezer bags, you can ensure all excess air is removed, and they take up the minimum of space. You can wash and re-use bags. If you would rather use a plastic box, select one that can be filled as completely as possible.

When you label a box or bag, use the table above to work out the use-by date, and write this on the label. This will helps you know at a glance what to use first and what can be left for another night.

(Ed. Accurate labelling will also eliminate the egg-white-fish-stock mix-up I made when trying to make a pavlova\!)

Try portioning your leftovers into smaller sizes. They’ll be easier to reheat or defrost. If the food requires defrosting before cooking, do this in the fridge.

And, of course, always ensure food is completely cooled (ideally refrigerated) before you put it in the freezer.
