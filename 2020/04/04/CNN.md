据意大利医生联合会称，北部省份的10,000多名医护人员已感染该病毒，原因是缺乏适当的防护设备，导致医疗机构内部的传染病蔓延。
Michele Monti上校回应了电话并告诉CNN，虽然他将其视为“孤立事件”，但消息很明确。
蒙蒂告诉美国有线电视新闻网：“这不是暴力，二十个人装满了他们的购物车，他们不想付钱，所以我们进行了干预，他们平静地离开了食物。”
在黑手党博客上写了自己的恐惧之后，他对CNN说：“黑手党正在煽风点火，并将很快点燃这种大火。”
反黑手党检察官费德里科·德·拉霍（Federico De Raho）告诉美国有线电视新闻网，社会不安是社会动荡的温床。

More than 10,000 health care workers in the northern provinces have been infected with the virus, according to the Italian Doctor's Federation, as a lack of proper protective gear made contagion inside healthcare facilities a contributor to the rampant spread.
Col. Michele Monti responded to the call and told CNN that while he viewed it as an "isolated incident" the message was clear.
"It wasn't violent, and the 20 people filled their carts said they didn't want to pay so we intervened and they calmly left without the food," Monti told CNN.
"The mafia is fanning the flames and will soon ignite this fire," he told CNN, after he wrote about his fears on his blog.
Anti-mafia prosecutor Federico De Raho told CNN that social unease is the breeding ground for social unrest.

西班牙卫生部周六公布的数据显示，西班牙科尔多瓦（CNN）现在再有809人死于冠状病毒，死亡总数为11,744人。

破纪录的日本厚生省证实，周四再有235例冠状病毒感染和3例死亡。
东京都知事小池百合子（Yoriko Koike）和安倍晋三（Abe）呼吁公众留在家里，避免旅行，并进行社交疏远。
小池知事周五宣布，东京为冠状病毒患者提供的750张床位中有628张被占用，其中大部分是症状较轻的人。

"Japan needs to have the courage to change, when we are aware we are on the wrong path," Iwata said.
"Testing people with a low probability of novel coronavirus would be a waste of resources," Japan's Health Ministry told CNN in a statement.
\#breaking Japan Health Ministry confirms 235 more infections and 3 deaths from coronavirus on Thursday.
Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike and Abe are pleading with the public to stay home, avoid travel, and practice social distancing.

亚特兰大（CNN）这是一个很多人都想回答的问题：究竟有多少人从Covid-19中康复？
多诺万说：“在中国境外发现的病例是基于当地媒体报道的国家一级的估计，可能大大低于实际数字。”
根据约翰·霍普金斯大学（Johns Hopkins University）仪表板的数据，截至周六，全球已有223,000人从Covid-19中康复。
迄今为止，没有证据表明从Covid-19中恢复的人可以被新型冠状病毒再次感染-尽管总体上没有很多数据，Hota说。
“这是一个未被充分研究的群体，” Hota关于康复的Covid-19患者说。

Atlanta (CNN) It's a question that many want answered: Exactly how many people recover from Covid-19?
"Recovered cases outside China are country-level estimates based on local media reports and may be substantially lower than the true number," Donovan said.
As of Saturday, more than 223,000 people worldwide have recovered from Covid-19, according to data from the Johns Hopkins University dashboard.
There's no evidence to date that people who recover from Covid-19 can get re-infected with the novel coronavirus -- though there isn't a lot of data in general, Hota said.
"This is a little bit of an understudied group," Hota said about recovered Covid-19 patients.

（CNN）本周，委内瑞拉一艘海军船只在该国北部沿海与一艘客轮相撞，并输掉了一场战斗，撞了几次，然后意外下水并下沉。
这艘德国拥有的RCGS Resolute游轮的所有人称，该船已在星期二上午在国际水域接受维修，当时武装海军船驶近并命令其改变方向。
据该公司称，当“开枪射击，此后不久，海军舰艇以135度角的速度驶向右舷并故意与RCGS Resolute相撞时，遭遇升级。”
哥伦比亚邮轮服务公司的声明说：“海军舰船继续向右舷撞船，显然是试图将船头转向委内瑞拉领海。”
但是，RCGS Resolute用钢板加固，可帮助其在冰中航行。

(CNN) A Venezuelan naval boat picked and lost a fight with a passenger cruise liner off the country's northern coast this week, ramming it several times before accidentally taking on water and sinking.
The proprietors of the German-owned RCGS Resolute cruise ship said its vessel had been receiving maintenance in international waters on Tuesday morning when the armed navy boat approached it and ordered it to change direction.
The encounter escalated when, according to the company, "gun shots were fired and, shortly thereafter, the navy vessel approached the starboard side at speed with an angle of 135 degrees and purposely collided with the RCGS Resolute."
"The navy vessel continued to ram the starboard bow in an apparent attempt to turn the ship's head towards Venezuelan territorial waters," Columbia Cruise Services' statement read.
However, the RCGS Resolute is reinforced with steel plating to help it navigate through ice.

纽约（CNN商业）随着经济继续流失工作，一些群体比其他群体更有可能面临失业风险。
与其他群体相比，少数民族工人，青少年和许多情况下的妇女正在失业。
经济与政策研究中心高级经济学家迪安·贝克说：“毫无疑问，他们受到的打击越来越严重。”
“他们在诸如旅馆，饭店和零售业等遭受重创的部门工作。”
随着企业关闭或远程运营，少数族裔也失去工作，例如保管服务。

New York (CNN Business) As the economy continues to hemorrhage jobs, it's becoming apparent that some groups are more at risk of unemployment than others.
Minority workers, teens and, in many cases, women, are losing jobs at a higher pace than other groups.
"There's no doubt about it, they're getting hit worse," said Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic & Policy Research.
"They're working in sectors like hotels, restaurants and retail that are being harder hit."
Minorities are also losing jobs such as custodial services as businesses close or are operating remotely.

国家家庭暴力热线首席执行官凯蒂·雷·琼斯说：“家庭暴力根植于权力和控制之中，我们所有人现在都感到权力和控制正在丧失。”
尽管警察和拥护者并未看到家庭暴力案件全面泛滥，但全国各地仍出现一些热点。
居家秩序对受害人的影响随着96％的美国人受到居家命令生活，一些城市的家庭暴力报告急剧上升。
现年63岁的Rhonda Voss是北卡罗来纳州的一名家庭暴力活动家和幸存者，他说在家中被困是家庭暴力受害者的噩梦。
关于与冠状病毒有关的致命家庭暴力案件的报道全国各地已经有数起与冠状病毒有关的家庭暴力死亡事件。

"Domestic violence is rooted in power and control, and all of us are feeling a loss of power and control right now," said Katie Ray-Jones, the CEO of the National Domestic Violence Hotline.
While police and advocates haven't seen jumps in domestic violence cases across the board, some hot spots are emerging around the country.
How stay-at-home orders impact victimsWith more than 96% of Americans living under stay-at-home orders, some cities are seeing significant jumps in domestic violence reports.
Rhonda Voss, 63, a domestic violence activist and survivor in North Carolina, said being cooped up at home is a domestic violence victim's nightmare.
Reports of deadly domestic violence cases tied to coronavirusThere have already been several domestic violence fatalities around the country which police have tied to coronavirus.

"He always took care of me, got me my coffee and help me in every way," she told CNN Friday.
Like other families across the US right now, Lewinger had to say goodbye to her husband virtually, over FaceTime in their case.
"Right now, not seeing anybody, it sometimes just feels like he's at work," she said.

Washington, DC (CNN) Less than a month ago, Mitch Patel's hotel business was booming.
His company, Vision Hospitality Group, owns 37 hotels in six states and it had seen record business in January and February, according to Patel.
Things were going so well, he was planning to open two more hotels this year, and seven next year.
But then, in early March, Patel met with executives from Marriott, the brand many of his hotels operate under, to discuss business.
The hotel business there had plummeted amid the coronavirus outbreak.

她说，需要更多地进行测试，以“保护我们的孩子，我们的家人，我们的朋友和我们的社区”。

(CNN) Pink said on social media Friday that she and her son spent weeks in isolation after positive tests for Covid-19 but a few days ago they both tested negative for the deadly infection.
She said when she and 3-year-old Jameson started showing symptoms two weeks ago they were already sheltering in place.
Pink said she felt fortunate her doctor was able to get her and her son tested.
"It is an absolute travesty and failure of our government to not make testing more widely accessible," she wrote on Twitter.
She said testing needs to be more available to "protect our children, our families, our friends and our communities."

越来越少的人在外面闲逛。
全球遏制冠状病毒传播的遏制措施似乎使世界变得更加安静。
在世界各地，地震学家正在观察到的环境地震噪声要少得多，这意味着汽车，火车，公共汽车和人们日常生活中产生的振动。
而且在没有这种噪音的情况下，地球的上地壳运动的程度略微降低了。
他说，这个噪音水平与地震学家在圣诞节那天看到的水平相当。

And fewer and fewer people can be found milling about outside.
Global containment measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus have seemingly made the world much quieter.
Around the world, seismologists are observing a lot less ambient seismic noise -- meaning, the vibrations generated by cars, trains, buses and people going about their daily lives.
And in the absence of that noise, Earth's upper crust is moving just a little less.
That noise level is on par with what seismologists would see on Christmas Day, he said.

游轮停飞。
全球疫情爆发后，航空公司立即采取了严厉的措施，从平凡的措施（如暂停热毛巾服务）到极端的措施（如给整个飞机喷洒消毒剂）。
那么，乘客将来会期望什么使他们对疾病的传播放心呢？
显然，飞机通过跨大陆运送受感染的乘客来加速了病毒的传播，但在机舱内传播的风险却鲜为人知。
“与飞机不同，游轮是疾病的巨大孵化器。

Cruise ships are grounded.
In the immediate wake of the global outbreak, airlines adopted stringent measures ranging from the mundane, like suspending hot towel service, to the extreme, like fogging an entire aircraft with disinfectant.
So what can passengers expect in the future to give them peace of mind about the spread of disease?
While it's clear that planes have accelerated the spread of the virus by transporting infected passengers across continents, the risks of transmission within the cabin are less known.
"Unlike airplanes, cruise ships are massive incubators of disease.

## 历史上最致命的空袭发生在二战期间的东京，您可能从未听说过

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
后来空袭被认为是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

## 木摩天大楼革命终于到来了吗？

### Has the wooden skyscraper revolution finally arrived?

Mjøstårnet的高度达到280英尺，于去年开放后成为世界上最高的木材建筑。
长期倡导和设计木制建筑的建筑师Michael Green表示，“现在有很多东西在融合。”
Or Framework是位于俄勒冈州波特兰的一座雄心勃勃的148英尺高的木塔，在去年因成本担忧而被取消之前，该塔被设定为美国最高的木塔。
考虑到在2018年之前，俄勒冈州成为美国第一个允许使用18层木制建筑的州，而在美国，没有任何地方允许任何超过6层的建筑物，这一决定意义重大。
该组织表示，除了担心森林砍伐外，洒水喷头不能有效防止烈焰扩散到木结构建筑中。

Reaching 280 feet in height, Mjøstårnet became the world's tallest timber building upon opening last year.
According to architect Michael Green, a longstanding advocate for -- and designer of -- wooden buildings, there are "a whole bunch of things converging right now."
Or Framework, an ambitious 148-foot-tall timber tower in Portland, Oregon, that was set to be the USA's tallest wooden tower before was canceled amid cost concerns last year.
The decision is significant given that, before 2018, when Oregon became the first US state to allow 18-story wooden buildings, nowhere in America permitted anything higher than six.
In addition to concerns about deforestation, the group says sprinklers are ineffective at preventing blazes from spreading through wood buildings.
