On Thursday, Spain's death toll surpassed 10,000, and the country joined Italy as one of only two to report five figure death tolls.

The ministry's most recent data shows there are now 78,733 active cases of Covid-19 in Spain, an increase of 2,511 from Thursday — but also the smallest daily rise since March 20.

A total of 6,532 people have been admitted to intensive care units since the pandemic began.
