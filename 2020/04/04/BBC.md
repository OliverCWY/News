在被问及中部地区住院人数增加47％时，NHS英格兰地区负责人斯蒂芬·鲍维斯（Stephen Powis）表示：“我很难对为何该国任何特定地区的比率都一次高涨做出特别的解释。”
约克郡和东北地区的住院率也增加了35％，但伦敦的住院率略有下降。
他补充说：“也许不足为奇的是，伦敦是主要的城市中心，而且感染率可能比该国其他地区高出一周左右”。
他指出，该国不同地区在暴发期间经历不同的感染率是正常的，包括正常年份的流感。

"I think it's difficult to give a particular explanation as to why any particular part of the country has a higher rate at any one time," NHS England Director Stephen Powis said, when asked about the 47% rise in hospital admissions in the Midlands.
There has also been a 35% increase in hospital admission rates in Yorkshire and the North East but a slight fall reported in London.
He added that "perhaps unsurprisingly, London is a major urban centre [and] has an infection rate which is maybe a week or so ahead of the rest of the country".
He noted that it was normal for different areas of the country to experience different rates of infections during outbreaks, including with influenza in a normal year.

詹妮·奥菲尔（Jenny Offill）的天气一系列广为流传的小插曲，广受赞誉的小说《天气》由图书管理员利兹（Lizzie）讲述，他坦率地谈到了她的日常工作和日常焦虑。
《电讯报》说：“天气取得了罕见的胜利……这是对现实生活的一种极端现实的描述。”
然而，这部初次登场的小说写得很轻巧，令人不经意间也充满了幽默感。
《观察家》说，这是“杰作”，“这种世代相传的书”。
它通过将想象和外推行为与历史事实相结合来实现其目标。”英国广播公司文化说，这是一部“深刻的人类”小说。

Weather by Jenny OffillA series of episodic vignettes, the widely acclaimed novel Weather is narrated by librarian Lizzie, who speaks with frankness about her daily preoccupations and ordinary anxieties.
“Weather achieves a rare triumph… it’s an uncannily realistic portrait of what it’s like to be alive right now,” says the Telegraph.
Yet this debut novel is written with a light touch, and makes for a witty, if uncomfortable, social satire.
It is “a masterpiece” and “the kind of book that comes along only once in a generation” says the Observer.
It achieves its aim by merging acts of imagination and extrapolation with historical fact.” It is a “profoundly human” novel, says BBC Culture.

一项受到密切关注的国际调查显示，冠状病毒大流行可能引发比1930年代大萧条更大的全球衰退。
采购经理人指数数据显示，包括英国，美国和欧元区在内的主要地理区域的制造业和服务业3月份活动均创历史新低。
数据由IHS Markit和特许采购与供应协会（CIPS）发布。
IHS Markit说：“自从2012年7月首次获得数据以来，对未来的信心是该调查记录的最低水平。”
至于英国的数字，他说：“总而言之：太可怕了，可能并没有反映出整个灾难。”

Manufacturing and services sectors in key geographical areas, including the UK, US and the eurozone, saw record falls in activity during March, according to Purchasing Managers’ Index data.
The data is published by IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS).
“Confidence about the future was the lowest recorded by the survey since data were first available in July 2012,” said IHS Markit.
As for the UK figures, he said: "In one line: horrendous, and probably not reflecting the full devastation."

The 3.5% unemployment rate in February was hovering near historic lows.

## 为什么呼吸慢可以帮助您放松

### Why slowing your breathing helps you relax

keywords/关键词: role system breathing nerve vagus heart restorative helps state rhythm relax slowing slow

同样重要的是，心脏周围动脉中的压力敏感压力感受器会进入迷走神经。
在长时间的呼气过程中，通过反复刺激迷走神经，缓慢的呼吸可能会使神经系统移向更安静的状态，从而导致积极的变化，例如心率降低和血压降低。
（要了解迷走神经及其在关节炎，糖尿病和心血管疾病等疾病中的作用的更多信息，请阅读Gaia Vince在Mosaic上发表的深入文章，或听她的广播纪录片。）
也许这些做法是通过无意识地意识到这种恢复性呼吸节奏及其将人们带入轻松但专注的精神状态的能力而发展起来的。
这可能是由于呼吸缓慢带来的心理舒适性以及对疼痛敏感性的任何直接生理变化。

Just as importantly, the pressure-sensitive baroreceptors, in the arteries around the heart, feed into the vagus nerve.
By repeatedly stimulating the vagus nerve during those long exhalations, slow breathing may shift the nervous system towards that more restful state, resulting in positive changes like a lower heart rate and lower blood pressure.
(To find out more about the vagus nerve and its role in conditions like arthritis, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, read Gaia Vince’s in-depth article at Mosaic, or listen to her radio documentary.)
Perhaps those practices evolved through an unconscious recognition of this restorative breathing rhythm and its capacity to send people into a relaxed but focused state of mind.
This may be due to the psychological comfort that comes from slow breathing, as much as any direct physiological changes to the pain sensitivity.

## 为什么旧金山最好的酸面团

1848年，詹姆斯·W·马歇尔（James W Marshall）在旧金山以北的山丘中发现了黄金，这引发了史诗般的规模迁移。
不知何故，这种面包比其他地方味道更鲜，更香，因此诞生了旧金山酸面团。
170多年后的今天，旧金山是酸面包的代名词。
旧金山和酸面包之间的另一个联系是：该地区长期存在的，注重原料的精神。
他们碰巧遇到了当时未被列入目录的细菌，因此给它起了一个名字：旧金山的乳酸杆菌，继旧金山之后，仍然认为它是海湾地区特有的。

When James W Marshall discovered gold in the hills north of San Francisco in 1848, it sparked a migration of epic proportions.
Somehow, the bread tasted tangier and more flavourful than it did elsewhere, and thus San Francisco sourdough was born.
More than 170 years later, San Francisco is synonymous with sourdough bread.
Another link between San Francisco and sourdough bread: the region’s long-running, ingredients-focused ethos.
They happened upon a then-uncatalogued bacterium, so they gave it a name: lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, after San Francisco, still believing it was Bay Area-unique.

在割草机运转之前，请确保草在积极生长。
理想情况下，将有两到三英寸的生长，以避免伤害草和根部。
选择干燥的一天，然后先修剪一下割草机刀片。
整理边缘也将带来巨大的变化，因此，如果您没有任何阴影，请使用铁锹锐化边框边缘，或抓住一些大剪刀，将手和膝盖放下并进行剪裁！

Make sure your grass is actively growing before giving the mower a run around.
Ideally there will be between two and three inches of growth, to avoid injuring the grass and any infection of the roots.
Choose a dry day and give your mower blades a sharpen-up first.
Neatening up the edges will also make a huge difference so, if you don’t have a strimmer, use a spade to sharpen the border edges, or grab some large scissors, get down on your hands and knees and get snipping\!

Schlafly’s cultural conservatism included working against abortion rights and same-sex marriage, issues that have become political lightning rods again in the Trump era.
“She might be one of the most liberated women in America,” Abzug says.
Schlafly has won, but “She is not going to have the last word,” Steinem tells Friedan.

现在很难想象，但是有一段时间人们正好在一年中只有几个月的时间里获取糖。
现在，我们的糖一年四季都来了，通常只需打开一瓶软饮料或麦片盒即可，其营养价值通常更低，而且更容易食用。
不需要专家就可以证明我们的现代食糖摄入量不如我们的觅食时期健康。
但是研究人员还得出结论，当高糖摄入与过量卡路里结合使用时，这种情况最容易发生，而且对健康的影响“更有可能”是由于糖摄入增加了过量卡路里的机会，而不仅仅是糖的影响。
糖，也称为“添加糖”，包括食用糖，甜味剂，蜂蜜和果汁，经过提取，精制并添加到食品和饮料中以改善口感。

It’s hard to imagine now, but there was a time when humans only had access to sugar for a few months a year when fruit was in season.
Now, our sugar hits come all year round, often with less nutritional value and far more easily – by simply opening a soft drink or cereal box.
It doesn’t take an expert to see that our modern sugar intake is less healthy than it was in our foraging days.
But the researchers also concluded that this occurs most often when high sugar intake is combined with excess calories, and that the effects on health are "more likely" due to sugar intake increasing the chance of excess calories, not the impact of sugar alone.
Sugar, otherwise known as "added sugar", includes table sugar, sweeteners, honey and fruit juices, and is extracted, refined and added to food and drink to improve taste.

很好地包装食物并消除暴露在空气中将有助于保持其风味和质地。
试图将一包从超市扔进冰箱，但重新包装食物可能会得到更好的结果，因此将空气暴露的可能性降到最低。
通过使用冷冻袋，可以确保除去所有多余的空气，并且它们占用的空间最小。
给盒子或袋子贴标签时，请使用上表确定使用日期，并将其写在标签上。
而且，当然，在将食物放入冰箱之前，请务必确保其已完全冷却（理想情况下已冷藏）。

Wrapping food well and eliminating exposure to air will help keep its flavour and texture.
It’s tempting to throw a packet from the supermarket into the freezer, but you may get better results from rewrapping the food so there’s minimum of exposure to air.
By using freezer bags, you can ensure all excess air is removed, and they take up the minimum of space.
When you label a box or bag, use the table above to work out the use-by date, and write this on the label.
And, of course, always ensure food is completely cooled (ideally refrigerated) before you put it in the freezer.

喜剧演员罗曼什·兰加纳森（Romesh Ranganathan）选择了亚恩·马特尔（Yann Martel）迷人的畅销书《 Pi生活》。
小说讲述了皮特·帕特尔（Pi Patel）的故事，他是一个在海上漂流数月的男孩，被困在一条带老虎的救生艇上。
随着冒险的进行以及Pi与老虎的刀锋关系（由于管理员错误，他被命名为Richard Parker），这种关系变得越来越引人注目。
Ranganathan说：“因为这是一个与您建立了关系并真正了解的脆弱的小男孩，这让我感到更加恐惧。”
最后还有惊人的转折……但是您必须阅读这本书（好吧，或者看电影大片改编）以了解它的含义。

Stand-up comedian Romesh Ranganathan picks Yann Martel’s enchanting bestseller Life of Pi.
The novel tells the story of Pi Patel, a boy who spends months adrift at sea, trapped on a lifeboat with a tiger.
As the adventure unfolds, and Pi’s knife-edge relationship with the tiger (who’s named Richard Parker, thanks to an admin error) develops, it becomes increasingly compelling.
“Because it’s this fragile little boy that you’ve formed a relationship with and got to really know, it just feels all the more scary,” says Ranganathan.
There’s also a stunning twist towards the end… but you’ll have to read the book (okay, or watch the blockbuster film adaptation) to find out what it is.
