Stand-up comedian Romesh Ranganathan picks Yann Martel’s enchanting bestseller Life of Pi. The novel tells the story of Pi Patel, a boy who spends months adrift at sea, trapped on a lifeboat with a tiger.

As the adventure unfolds, and Pi’s knife-edge relationship with the tiger (who’s named Richard Parker, thanks to an admin error) develops, it becomes increasingly compelling. “You want them to really get on and bond,” Ranganathan says. “It’s sort of almost like a buddy movie in a way.”

Pi faces moments of real jeopardy and danger, from a huge storm and circling sharks, to a hyena disemboweling a zebra on-board the boat. “Because it’s this fragile little boy that you’ve formed a relationship with and got to really know, it just feels all the more scary,” says Ranganathan.

There’s also a stunning twist towards the end… but you’ll have to read the book (okay, or watch the blockbuster film adaptation) to find out what it is.
