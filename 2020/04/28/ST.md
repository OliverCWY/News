We will see - you'll probably be hearing in the not too distant future," Mr Trump said.

华盛顿（法新社）-在百老汇和电视演员尼克·科德罗（Nick Cordero）的医生在重症监护室接受科维迪19的治疗近三周后，他被迫截肢。
可以肯定的是，由于各种原因，在重症监护患者中会发生所谓的“血栓形成事件”，但Covid-19患者中的发生率远高于预期。
血凝块不仅对我们的四肢有危险，而且会进入肺部，心脏或大脑，在这些地方可能导致致命的肺栓塞，心脏病发作和中风。
Bikdeli说，专家们发现风险是如此之大，以至于Covid-19患者“可能甚至需要在进行影像学检查之前就需要预防，预防性地使用血液稀释剂”。
其次，在重症监护中，一个人很可能会形成凝块，因为他们会静置这么长时间。

WASHINGTON (AFP) - After he had spent nearly three weeks in an intensive care unit being treated for Covid-19, Broadway and TV actor Nick Cordero's doctors were forced to amputate his right leg.
To be sure, so-called "thrombotic events" occur for a variety of reasons among intensive care patients, but the rates among Covid-19 patients are far higher than would be otherwise expected.
Blood clots aren't just dangerous for our limbs, but can make their way to the lungs, heart or brain, where they may cause lethal pulmonary embolisms, heart attacks, and strokes.
The experts found the risks were so great that Covid-19 patients "may need to receive blood thinners, preventively, prophylactically," even before imaging tests are ordered, said Bikdeli.
Next, being in intensive care makes a person likelier to develop a clot because they are staying still for so long.

华盛顿（路透社）-美国总统唐纳德·特朗普周一（4月27日）表示，中国本可以在冠状病毒席卷全球之前停止它，并表示他的政府正在对发生的事情进行“严重调查”。

据路透社统计，冠状病毒的爆发已经杀死了全世界20.7万人，其中包括美国的5.5万人。

The coronavirus outbreak has killed more than 207,000 people around the world, including more than 55,000 in the United States, according to a Reuters tally.
Earlier on Monday, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro accused China of sending low-quality and even counterfeit coronavirus antibody testing kits to the United States and of“profiteering” from the pandemic.
The United States is heavily reliant on China for basic equipment and drugs.
