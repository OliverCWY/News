Once seen as a model of Covid-19 response, Singapore is now battling a second wave of the virus with over 14,000 cases in total. But the question being asked here is - is the government doing enough testing?

The majority of Singapore's cases have been linked to migrant workers who live in cramped dormitories, shared by up to 17 people. Up to 12 dormitories have now been marked as isolation zones, and thousands of workers inside have been quarantined.

But Alex Au of migrant rights group Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2), said not enough testing was being done, adding that it was "unclear" who would get tested and who wouldn't.

"We're hearing reports that workers who are running a fever are not seen by doctors for several hours or up to a day - they're just told to take paracetamol and monitor," he told the BBC.

"In another case, a man who had a 39 degree fever had a doctor treating him. So who gets tested and who doesn't is very unclear.

"I suspect it is an indication that maybe testing capacity is under strain, so they're picking and choosing who they test. I can't say for certain but I suspect we're on the brink of an overwhelmed healthcare system."

Singapore's health minister said the rate of testing had not slowed down, and that around 3,000 workers a day were being tested.

Gan Kim Yong said that 21,000 workers - or 1 in 15 - in dorms have already been tested.

"This is far higher than the testing rates seen in other countries like Korea, which is one in 90, as well as other countries like the United States, United Kingdom, or even Hong Kong,” Mr Gan said.
