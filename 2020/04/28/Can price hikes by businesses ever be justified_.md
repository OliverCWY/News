Shaping regulation – and reputation

Yet all the transparency in the world may not be enough for consumers worried by the state of their finances. People are instinctively repelled by anything they perceive as price gouging, and moral psychology research suggests that this is a powerful feeling.

Apsana Begum, a member of parliament representing the densely populated East London area of Poplar and Limehouse, says she’s heard plenty of people vent about high prices. Especially in the early days of the crisis, it was hard for people to pay two or three times the normal prices for toilet roll and hand wash at smaller businesses. “This was actually causing a lot of anger locally, and understandably so.”

Begum is sympathetic to the small businesses struggling to keep the lights on and applauds the many traders that have not sought to profit from the emergency. Some butchers, especially, report increased prices from suppliers and are just trying to pay the bills. Other costs that may have increased, for retailers of all sizes, include hazard pay and more overtime for existing staff, the hiring of temporary employees, higher transport costs and purchases of more protective and cleaning equipment (even though some governments are covering portions of these expenses).

Yet Begum believes that overall the government needs to do more to safeguard a sense of community responsibility among retailers. Last month she tabled an early day motion (a motion submitted for parliamentary debate) calling for stronger government action against price hikes. Begum urges more analysis of how businesses in different categories, including suppliers and wholesalers, are affected by the crisis. Also helpful, she says, would be further resources directed to the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which is fielding complaints from consumers and pleading with businesses not to price gouge.

Nicole Kar, head of UK competition at the law firm Linklaters, believes that this motion could lead to action if it’s accompanied by a groundswell of people complaining on social media, consumer advice organisations campaigning and – especially – further government consideration of “wartime” measures against profiteering. In many countries, she explains, price gouging is not in itself illegal. In the UK, only monopolistic practices or collusion between businesses would typically be illegal.

France has capped retail and wholesale prices of hydroalcoholic gels for sanitising hands. China has prohibited unnecessary stockpiling of some protective medical equipment and food. Australia has made it illegal for retailers to purchase items like goggles and resell them for a mark-up of more than 20%. US states have a patchwork of laws, but California’s anti-price gouging statute limits price increases to 10% if a state of emergency is declared.
