在受到医疗专业人员的严厉批评之后，特朗普表示，他的言论是讽刺的。
在星期一的Covid-19新闻发布会上，一位记者指出，马里兰州的紧急热线最近几天接到了数百个电话，以寻求有关特朗普发表评论的指导。
当被问及他是否对增加电话量负有全部责任时，特朗普先生回答：“不，我不。”
在周一的玫瑰园新闻发布会上，特朗普还被问到是否会推迟十一月份的总统选举。
特朗普说：“我期待这次选举。”

Following heavy criticism from medical professionals, Mr Trump said his remarks were made sarcastically.
During Monday's Covid-19 news conference, a reporter noted that the state of Maryland's emergency hotline had received hundreds of calls in recent days seeking guidance about Mr Trump's comments.
When asked whether he took responsibility at all for the increase in calls, Mr Trump replied: "No, I don't."
During Monday's Rose Garden press conference, Mr Trump was also asked whether he would delay the presidential election in November.
"I look forward to that election," Mr Trump said.

在2016年投票支持唐纳德·特朗普的三位美国人对美国总统对这种病毒的反应进行了评分，包括他最近对消毒剂的评论。
田纳西州和北卡罗来纳州的两个人赞扬特朗普先生的决定，但印第安纳州的一名支持者因缺乏一致的信息而感到沮丧。
BBC新闻于2017年1月总统就职前首次与这些选民进行了交谈，此后已与他们相遇了好几次。

VideoThree Americans who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 rate the US president's response to the virus, including his recent comments about disinfectant.
While the two from Tennessee and North Carolina praise Mr Trump for his decisions, one supporter from Indiana is frustrated by the lack of a consistent message.
BBC News first spoke to these voters before the president's inauguration in January 2017 and has caught up with them several times since.

他们谈论了来自Covid-19感染的“印度降低死亡率背后的奥秘”，并说印度正在“逆转冠状病毒趋势”。
印度已经报道了超过27,000例感染，另一个问题是印度是否“遗失”了Covid-19死亡。
显然，仅计算医院死亡人数不足以准确计算出Covid-19的死亡人数。
接下来是如何定义Covid-19死亡的问题。
比利时伊拉斯姆大学医院重症监护医学教授让·路易·文森特（Jean-Louis Vincent）告诉我，“在许多国家，包括印度”，有关Covid-19死亡的报道不足。

Clearly, counting hospital deaths alone is not going to be sufficient enough to get an accurate number of Covid-19 fatalities.
Then there's the question of how to define a Covid-19 death.
Jean-Louis Vincent, a professor of Intensive Care Medicine at Belgium's Erasme University Hospital, told me there was under-reporting of Covid-19 deaths "in many countries, including India".

像巴兹特里卡（Bazterrica）一样，阿姆斯特尔（Amstell）在观看《地球人》（Earthlings）之后进行了纯素食–纪录片也是他制作《屠杀》的直接灵感。
它设定在2067年，这是英国完全素食主义者的空想的未来。
发行时，Bong解释了他在写Okja的过程中如何去了一家屠宰场，然后进行了纯素食两个月。
Carnage和Okja都于2017年发布，他们都期望过去三年的素食热潮。
看到这本书将如何影响新一代的读者和消费者，将会很有趣。

Amstell, like Bazterrica, went vegan after watching Earthlings – and the documentary was also his direct inspiration for making Carnage.
It is set in 2067, an imagined utopian future where the UK is fully vegan.
At the time of its release, Bong explained how he visited a slaughterhouse while writing Okja, and subsequently went vegan for two months.
Both released in 2017, Carnage and Okja anticipated the vegan boom of the past three years.
It will be interesting to see how the book will influence a new generations of readers and consumers.

曾经被视为Covid-19响应的典范，新加坡现在正在与第二波病毒作斗争，总数已超过14,000例。
新加坡的大多数案件都与居住在拥挤的宿舍中的移徙工人有关，最多有17人。
“我怀疑这表明测试能力可能受压，因此他们正在选择要测试的人。
新加坡卫生部长表示，检测速度并未减慢，每天约有3,000名工人正在接受检测。
甘金勇说，已经有21,000名工人（即15人中有1人）在宿舍中接受了测试。

Once seen as a model of Covid-19 response, Singapore is now battling a second wave of the virus with over 14,000 cases in total.
The majority of Singapore's cases have been linked to migrant workers who live in cramped dormitories, shared by up to 17 people.
"I suspect it is an indication that maybe testing capacity is under strain, so they're picking and choosing who they test.
Singapore's health minister said the rate of testing had not slowed down, and that around 3,000 workers a day were being tested.
Gan Kim Yong said that 21,000 workers - or 1 in 15 - in dorms have already been tested.

自12月以来，叙利亚的内战已导致约一百万人逃离家园。一份报告警告说，由于冲突或灾难，全世界有创纪录的5080万人在国内流离失所，冠状病毒构成了新的威胁。
IDMC说，另外有五百万人因地震和洪水等自然灾害而流离失所。
报告还补充说，国内流离失所者的数量（逃离冲突或灾难但留在自己国家的人数）现已达到历史最高水平。
新报告称，即使没有大流行，全球范围内的国内流离失所者人数也标志着集体失败。
IDMC报告还指出了由病毒引起的内部流离失所事件。

It adds that the number of people internally displaced - those who flee conflict or disaster but remain in their own countries - has now reached a record high.
But even without the pandemic, the number of internally displaced people across the globe is a sign, the new report says, of collective failure.
The IDMC report also notes incidents of internal displacement attributed to the virus.

Luckin Coffee在其官方的微博帐户上确认，该产品正在接受国家市场监管局（SAMR）的检查。
Luckin Coffee并未立即回应BBC的要求以发表进一步评论。
自五月份在纽约首次亮相以来，这些增长数据帮助该公司的美国股票市值几乎翻了三倍。

Luckin Coffee did not immediately respond to a request from the BBC for further comment.
Those growth figures had helped the company's US stock market value almost triple since its debut in New York in May.

人们本能地被他们认为是价格欺诈的一切所排斥，并且道德心理学研究表明这是一种强大的感觉。
上个月，她提出了一项提早动议（一项提交议会辩论的动议），呼吁政府采取更强有力的措施来反对价格上涨。
Begum敦促对包括供应商和批发商在内的不同类别的企业如何受危机影响进行更多分析。
她解释说，在许多国家，价格欺诈本身并不是非法的。
美国各州法律各不相同，但如果宣布进入紧急状态，加利福尼亚州的反价格欺诈法规将价格上涨幅度限制在10％。

People are instinctively repelled by anything they perceive as price gouging, and moral psychology research suggests that this is a powerful feeling.
Last month she tabled an early day motion (a motion submitted for parliamentary debate) calling for stronger government action against price hikes.
Begum urges more analysis of how businesses in different categories, including suppliers and wholesalers, are affected by the crisis.
In many countries, she explains, price gouging is not in itself illegal.
US states have a patchwork of laws, but California’s anti-price gouging statute limits price increases to 10% if a state of emergency is declared.

## 冷冻，新鲜或罐头食品：什么更有营养？

### Frozen, fresh or canned food: What’s more nutritious?

最近几周，由于购物者希望储备持久的食品，因此罐装和冷冻食品的销量激增。
Hachem说：“如果准备长时间存放在货架上，则可能会使蔬菜失去一些营养价值，”
2007年，戴维斯加州大学戴维斯分校的前食品科学与技术研究员戴安娜·巴雷特（Diane Barrett）对许多研究进行了研究，研究了新鲜，冷冻和罐装水果和蔬菜的营养成分。
她发现，例如，菠菜如果在20°C（68°F）的室温下保存，将在7天内损失100％的维生素C含量；如果冷藏，它将损失75％。
但是，相比之下，胡萝卜在室温下保存一周仅损失其维生素C含量的27％。

In recent weeks, as shoppers have looked to stock up on food that lasts, sales of canned and frozen food have surged.
“Vegetables destined for cooking fresh might lose some of their nutritional value if they stay for long on the shelves,” Hachem says.
In 2007, Diane Barrett, a former food science and technology researcher at the University of California, Davis, reviewed numerous studies looking into the nutritional content of fresh, frozen and tinned fruits and vegetables.
She found that spinach, for example, loses 100% of its vitamin C content in seven days if stored at a room temperature of 20C (68F); it loses 75% if refrigerated.
But carrots, by contrast, only lose 27% of their vitamin C content when stored for a week at room temperature.

您不能在迟到五分钟的会议上花时间参加会议–在这个瑞士城市中，主要工业，化学和制药业都与精度和控制有关。
但是，如果您深入探究巴塞尔的表象，就会发现令人困惑的矛盾，这些矛盾使巴塞尔变得十分有趣。
巴塞尔狂欢节被称为法斯纳赫特（Fasnacht），是纪律和酒后狂欢活动的独特融合。
但这就是巴塞尔，Fasnacht实际上是在Ash Ashes星期三之后的第一个星期一开始的，也就是说，在Lent已经开始之后。
Hirscheneck是结束一天的好地方，就像喷泉和Fasnacht一样，在巴塞尔还有很多其他地方，非常有趣。

It’s not somewhere you can waltz into a meeting five minutes late – not in this Swiss city whose major industries, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, are all about precision and control.
But if you dip beneath its surface, you discover the beguiling contradictions that make Basel serious fun.
Known as Fasnacht, Basel’s Carnival is a peculiar mixture of discipline and booze-fuelled jollity.
But this being Basel, Fasnacht actually begins on the first Monday after Ash Wednesday ­– that is, after Lent has already begun.
A great place to end your day, Hirscheneck is, like the fountains and Fasnacht and so much else in Basel, serious fun.

“这很有道理，” Stacey Fordham在她位于英国布里斯托尔的零废物商店Zero Green中，站在工匠食用油，天然健康产品以及面食，谷物和豆类分配器中，说道。
她的商店是该市接受英国最大社区货币布里斯托尔英镑的500家企业之一。
什么是社区货币？
世界上有成千上万的社区货币，这一概念已经存在了数十年，并且在过去的几年中，随着越来越多的数字化货币变得越来越流行。

“Bristol Pounds stand for so many things that we do.
It just made sense,” says Stacey Fordham, standing amid artisan cooking oils, natural wellbeing products and dispensers for pasta, grains and pulses at her zero-waste shop, Zero Green in Bristol, England.
Her store is one of around 500 businesses in the city that accept the Bristol Pound, Britain's largest community currency.
What’s a community currency?
There are thousands of community currencies in the world and the concept has been around for decades, and in the past couple of years, they’re becoming more popular as more have become digital.

因此，您没有把它们做成冰沙或香蕉蛋糕，而是把它们扔掉了，大声地想着是什么使它们如此快地变成棕色。
如果我们要在减少碳排放和最大程度地减少环境影响的同时支持不断增长的世界人口，那么解决过多的食物浪费是最大的挑战之一。
但是越来越多的世界注意到，许多食物从一开始就从未被食用过。
2011年，联合国粮食及农业组织（FAO）委托撰写了一份关于我们食品链效率高低的特别报告，由此引发了粮食损失和食物浪费的问题。
根据一些粗略的估计，研究得出的结论是，全球用于人类消费的食物中有三分之一是丢失或浪费的。

So instead of making a smoothie or a banana cake, you throw them away, wondering aloud what made them go brown so fast.
If we are to support a growing world population while cutting carbon emissions and minimising environmental impact, then tackling excessive food waste is one of the biggest challenges.
But increasingly, the world is noticing that much of that food is never eaten in the first place.
The issue of food loss and food waste took off in 2011 when the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) commissioned a special report into how efficient – or inefficient – our food chain was.
The study concluded, based on some rough estimates, that globally one-third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted.

当艾比·斯坦（Abby Stein）跨性别出现时，她通过超正统的Hasidic社区发出了冲击波。
我不知道还有其他人像我一样，但是我知道自己的感受-我只是把自己看作一个女孩。
Hasidic社区是我所知道或听说过的最性别隔离的社会-我对性别隔离的社区进行了大量研究。
我是Hasidic社区中第一个以跨性别形式出现的人，但是自那以后已经有很多人了，很显然，我为此受到了谴责。
我绝对认为我可以为此感到赞赏-Hasidic社区永远不会再一样了。

When Abby Stein came out as trans, she sent shock waves through the ultra-Orthodox Hasidic community.
I didn't know there were other people like me, but I knew what I felt - I just saw myself as a girl.
The Hasidic community is the most gender-segregated society I've ever known or heard about - and I have researched gender-segregated communities quite a bit.
I was the first person in the Hasidic community to come out as trans, but there have been quite a few people since, and obviously, I'm being blamed for that.
I definitely think I can take some credit for it - the Hasidic community is never going to be the same again.

古代金山巨石的复杂性非同寻常。
在三个站点中，太阳观测站不仅可以精确测量至极点和春分点，而且可以精确测量leap年。
但是如果不是两个人偶然发现石头上奇怪的蚀刻，他们将被隐藏在森林中。
没有任何科学背景，小林佳树（Yoshiki Kobayashi）和德保志保（Shiho Tokuda）便开始了解世界上三个最先进的太阳观测站是如何工作的。

The ancient Kanayama Megaliths are extraordinary in their complexity.
Across three sites, the solar observatories accurately measure not only solstices and equinoxes but also leap years.
But they would have been left hidden in the forest if it weren't for two people who stumbled upon some strange etchings in the stones.
Without any scientific background, Yoshiki Kobayashi and Shiho Tokuda set out to understand how three of the the world's most sophisticated solar observatories worked.
