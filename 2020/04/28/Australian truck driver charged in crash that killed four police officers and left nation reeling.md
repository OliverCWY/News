(CNN) A truck driver in Melbourne, Australia, faced court on Monday after killing four police officers in a crash last week that sparked an outpouring of grief and anger across the country.

The driver, 47-year-old Mohinder Singh, was charged with four counts of culpable driving. Another man, Richard Pusey, has also been charged on multiple indictable offenses, including speeding, failure to render assistance, destruction of evidence and drug possession.

Last Wednesday, Pusey, 41, was speeding down a Melbourne freeway in a Porsche at 140 kilometers per hour (about 87 miles per hour). He was then pulled over by two police officers on the emergency stopping lane, and failed a drug test. Two more officers arrived to help impound the Porsche, according to Victoria state police.

Singh, who was driving a large refrigerated truck, switched from a traffic lane into the stopping lane, crashing into the police vehicle and the Porsche at 100 kph (about 62 mph). The four officers died on the scene and Singh suffered a "medical episode," but Pusey was not injured, police said.

At a hearing on Friday, Singh's lawyer Steven Pica said his client remained "distressed and saddened at the tragic consequences of his acts."
