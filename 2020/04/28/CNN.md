伊恩·拉希夫（Ian Lahiffe）返回北京后的第二天早上，就在他的前门外安装了监视摄像机。
根据现在属于Informa Tech一部分的IHS Markit Technology的报告，截至2018年，中国安装了3.49亿个监控摄像头，几乎是美国摄像头数量的五倍。
为了执行家庭隔离，地方当局再次诉诸技术-并公开使用监控摄像头。
法律立场中国目前没有专门的国家法律来规范公共场所使用监控摄像头。
常州居民周威廉（William Zhou）现在看来，人们前门的监控摄像头并不在那里。

A surveillance camera was installed outside Ian Lahiffe's front door the morning after he returned to Beijing.
According to a report from IHS Markit Technology, now a part of Informa Tech, China had 349 million surveillance cameras installed as of 2018, nearly five times the number of cameras in the United States.
To enforce home quarantine, local authorities have again resorted to technology -- and have been open about the use of surveillance cameras.
The legal stanceChina currently has no specific national law to regulate the use of surveillance cameras in public spaces.
William Zhou, Changzhou residentFor now, it appears that the surveillance cameras on people's front doors are not there to stay.

研究人员周一报道，随着Covid-19病毒开始传播，整个美国的死亡人数激增，许多人从未归因于新的冠状病毒。
在同一时间，各州报告有8000人死于Covid-19。
研究小组写道：“在纽约市，这种差异更加明显，全因死亡的超额死亡人数是肺炎和流感死亡人数的三到四倍。”
一些州，例如纽约，似乎跟上了Covid-19的死亡人数。
该小组在MedRxiv上在线发表的预印本中写道：“例如，加利福尼亚报告了101例因COVID-19死亡和399例过度的肺炎和流感死亡。”

(CNN) Deaths across America spiked as Covid-19 began its spread, and many were never attributed to the new coronavirus, researchers reported Monday.
During the same time, states reported 8,000 deaths from Covid-19.
"In New York City, this discrepancy was even more stark, with three to four times as many excess all-cause deaths as pneumonia and influenza deaths," the team wrote.
Some states, such as New York, seemed to keep up with the Covid-19 deaths.
"For instance, California had 101 reported deaths due to COVID-19 and 399 excess pneumonia and influenza deaths," the team wrote in a preprint published online in MedRxiv (pronounced Med Archive).

艾未未（CNA）由史蒂芬·钟（Stephy Chung）撰写，全世界都在努力采取前所未有的封锁措施，艾未未发现自己处在熟悉的领域。
艾未未认为，中国早期有选择地处理信息提供了“病毒传播的机会”。
但是，了解中国的动机对艾未未而言是所谓的掩盖行为，或者暗示该国的感染人数和死亡人数被低报的暗示同样重要。
正如艾未未所看到的那样，如果没有信息的“控制和操纵”，中国就不会成为一个国家。
艾未未的“记住”。

Written by Stephy Chung, CNNAs the world grapples with unprecedented lockdown measures, Ai Weiwei finds himself in familiar territory.
According to Ai, China's selective handing of information early on provided a "chance for the virus to spread."
However, understanding China's motivations is as important to Ai as the alleged cover-up, or the suggestion that the country's infection numbers and fatalities have been under-reported.
As Ai sees it, China would not function as a state without the "control and manipulation" of information.

不同的人收到不同的尼安德特人基因片段，因此对现代人类基因组进行的广泛研究可以揭示不同方面。
该研究的另一方面揭示了更多有关尼安德特人基因在现代人类DNA中构成疾病的潜在风险的信息。
事实证明，与我们其余基因相比，尼安德特人的DNA只是杯水车薪。
“但是，我们的研究表明，直接位于尼安德特人基因旁的人类基因变异是对这种风险的更好解释。”
Skov开发了一种在人类DNA中追踪尼安德特人基因的方法。

Different people received different pieces of Neanderthal genes, so a wide study analyzing the genomes of modern humans can reveal different aspects.
Another aspect of the study revealed more information about the potential risk of disease that Neanderthal genes pose in modern human DNA.
It turns out that Neanderthal DNA is only a drop in the bucket compared with the rest of our genes.
"However, our study shows that the human gene variants located directly beside the Neanderthal genes are better explanations for the risk."
Skov developed a method to trace Neanderthal genes in human DNA.

”“是的，正如我所说，真的很抱歉，……”“对不起？
在那短暂而令人振奋的时间里，很容易理解为什么拥有自己的酒店吸引了如此众多的记者和其他创意专业人士。
更糟糕的是，出于对业务的热心，我将自己在岛上建造的房子抵押给了我来之不易的贷款。
我所购买的业务本质上是稳定的，该岛的旅游经济强劲且不断增长，可以依靠我的员工保持收支平衡，按揭付款。

Four months later, having already developed a slightly queasy sense that I might have made a mistake, confirmation that I wasn't cut out for the hospitality trade duly arrived over breakfast in the hotel dining room, one November Sunday morning.
”"Yes, well, as I said, really sorry and ... ""Sorry?
During that brief, exhilarating time it was easy to understand why having your own hotel appeals to so many journalists and others from creative professions.
To make things worse, in my zeal to get into the business I'd mortgaged the house I'd built on the island to clinch my hard-won loan.
The business I'd bought was essentially solid, the island's tourist economy was strong and growing and my employees could be relied on to keep things ticking over on a breakeven, pay the mortgage basis.

你知道的：一件连帽的丝绒夹克和裤子，在战利品上散布着光芒四射的Juicy Couture徽标（我们知道这很细微）。
但是，glamazon非常喜欢这套服装，因此她决定放弃设计师们带来的真正的时装。
J.Lo在整个十年的大部分时间里都穿着不同的裤子版本，从桃红色的数字搭配细高跟鞋和报童风格的帽子（还记得吗？）
他们所有人都采用Juicy Couture作为外观，当与Uggs一起运动时，显得更加特别。
“与卡戴珊同伴保持联系”（金在Juicy Couture上也很重要）于2007年首播。

You know the one: a hooded velour jacket and pants, with a bedazzled Juicy Couture logo spread across the booty (subtle, we know).
But the glamazon loved the outfit so much she decided to forgo the real couture her stylists had brought on set.
J.Lo wore different iterations of the pants throughout much of the decade, from a peachy number paired with stilettos and newsboy-style cap (remember that?)
All of them adopted Juicy Couture as their look du jour, made all the more special when sported with Uggs.
"Keeping up with the Kardashians" (Kim was also big on Juicy Couture) first aired in 2007.

“你正在走原子弹的道路。”
这块板是75年前在广岛和长崎投下的原子弹放在一起的地方。
法雷尔说，虽然对我来说快了两分钟，但对于埃诺拉·盖伊（Enola Gay）上的男人来说，还远远没有达到。

绰号“小男孩”的原子弹在其上方2,000英尺处引爆。

"You're walking the path of the atomic bomb."
This slab is where the atomic bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki 75 years ago were put together.
While it's two quick minutes for me, it was far from it for the men aboard Enola Gay, Farrell says.

The atomic bomb nicknamed "Little Boy" detonated 2,000 feet above it.

尽管NASA表示蠕虫徽标很有可能在未来再次出现，但该组织的官方徽标仍是“肉丸”设计，该设计是在机构成立1959年后引入的，从1975年开始被蠕虫所取代1992年。

美国宇航局首席历史学家比尔·巴里在电话中说：“我认为最大的问题是它的宣布方式。”
但也有一个事实，就是他讨厌蠕虫徽标。
幸亏有设计爱好者，美国宇航局现任行政长官吉姆·布莱登斯汀（Jim Bridenstine）于4月初在Twitter上宣布了该蠕虫的归还，但对这种徽标的看法却有所不同，这是“受美国宇航局蠕虫时代的美国宇航局任务启发”的。

While NASA says there's "a good chance" the worm logo will pop up again in the future, the organization's official logo remains the "meatball" design introduced a year after the agency was established, in 1959, and replaced by the worm from 1975 until 1992.

"I think the big problem was how it was announced," said Bill Barry, NASA's chief historian, over the phone.
But there was also the fact that he hated the worm logo.
Thankfully for design buffs, NASA's current administrator, Jim Bridenstine, who announced the return of the worm on Twitter in early April, views the logo differently, having grown up "inspired by NASA missions during the era of the NASA worm."

## 历史上最致命的空袭发生在二战期间的东京，您可能从未听说过

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
后来空袭被认为是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

## 为了安全起见，他们被送到庇护所。相反，这些妇女说她们遭到了性虐待

但是，美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）采访了包括帕特里夏（Patricia）在内的五名十几岁和二十多岁的女性，他们声称格拉瑟（Glaser）在Bery's Place对其进行了性和情感虐待。
当女孩们反对时，他们说格拉泽会威胁要把他们赶出去。
一些幸存者说，格拉瑟（Glaser）介绍自己是一名医生，但支持起诉的律师告诉美国有线电视新闻网（CNN），他是物理治疗师-不是合格的医生。
Dilen于去年2月在Bery's Place进行的一次警察突袭中因警察的讯问而被捕，后来被释放。
但至少现在，他们说他们开始在贝里故居之外享受生活。

But five women in their late teens and early twenties interviewed by CNN, including Patricia, allege that Glaser sexually and emotionally abused them at Bery's Place.
When the girls objected, they say Glaser would threaten to cast them out on the streets.
Some survivors say Glaser introduced himself as a doctor, but lawyers supporting the prosecution told CNN that he is a physiotherapist -- not a qualified physician.
Dilen was arrested for questioning by police last February during a police raid at Bery's Place, and later released.
But for now, at least, they say they're beginning to enjoy their lives outside of Bery's Place.

## 香港冠状病毒检疫营内的情况

### What it's like inside a Hong Kong coronavirus quarantine camp

假日营地变成了隔离营地-隔离饮食-温度检查和穿PPE的工作人员在隔离区生活-感觉像是在学校，营地和监狱中混合在一起。
我的工厂位于鲤鱼门公园，通常是香港岛东部一个绿树成荫的度假村。
这个假日公园是香港用作冠状病毒检疫中心的几处设施之一。
在此之前，我已经在家工作了三个月-因此，在隔离营中做同样的事情并没有多大区别。
但这证明了香港政府对遏制从海外进口的案件并推回本地自满情绪的重视程度。

Holiday camp turned quarantine campLife in quarantine -- with its regimented meals, temperature checks and PPE-wearing staff -- feels like an odd mix of being in school, at camp, and in prison.
My facility, in Lei Yue Mun Park, is normally a leafy holiday village in the east of Hong Kong Island.
This holiday park is one of several facilities being used as coronavirus quarantine centers in Hong KongSince March, that number has surged.
Prior to now, I'd already been working from home for three months -- so doing the same from a quarantine camp hasn't made much of a difference.
But it's a testament to how serious the Hong Kong government is about clamping down on cases imported from overseas, and pushing back on local complacency.
