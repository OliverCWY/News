Hong Kong (CNN Business) The coronavirus pandemic has halted production on TV shows and movies around the world, with travel plans canceled, gatherings forbidden and shoots postponed.

In Australia, however, legendary soap opera "Neighbours" will resume filming as soon as this week — with a number of creative tweaks.

Actors will have to follow social distancing rules. The cast and crew are isolated in different groups. And to make it all look normal on screen, they'll rely on clever camerawork and some editing magic.

The drama, which follows the residents of a fictional suburb of Melbourne, first suspended production in mid-March as coronavirus infections in Australia surged. The country now has 6,547 cases, and 67 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.

"The health and safety of cast and crew is paramount and we have been following the government guidelines closely," said Jason Herbison, the show's executive producer.
