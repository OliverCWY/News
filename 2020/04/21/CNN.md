（CNN）据一位直接知情的美国官员称，美国正在监测情报，暗示朝鲜领导人金正恩（Kim Jong Un）在接受过一次外科手术后处于严重危险之中。
另一位熟悉情报的消息人士告诉美国有线电视新闻网，美国一直在密切监视有关金正日健康的报道。
朝鲜严格控制围绕其领导人的任何信息，而领导人几乎被视为国内的神灵。
过去朝鲜领导人没有参加这些重要的庆祝活动时，就预示着重大事态发展。
他带着拐杖回来了，几天后，韩国情报人员说他的脚踝上有一个囊肿。

(CNN) The US is monitoring intelligence that suggests North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un , is in grave danger after undergoing a previous surgery, according to a US official with direct knowledge.
A second source familiar with the intelligence told CNN that the US has been closely monitoring reports on Kim's health.
North Korea tightly controls any information surrounding its leader, who is treated almost like a deity within the country.
When North Korean leaders have not shown up to these important celebrations in the past, it has portended major developments.
He returned sporting a cane, and days later South Korean intelligence said that he had a cyst removed from his ankle.

伦敦（CNN商业）维珍大西洋航空公司和维珍澳大利亚航空如果要在冠状病毒大流行引发的经济危机中度过难关，将需要政府的支持。
亿万富翁创始人理查德·布兰森（Richard Branson）周一表示，航空公司需要英国和澳大利亚政府的资金来继续运营，以“面对当今旅行所面临的严重不确定性”，其中包括不清楚飞机必须停飞多长时间。
布兰森在致员工的一封公开信中表示，维珍大西洋航空公司和维珍澳大利亚航空的生存对于向英国航空公司及其子公司及其他航空公司提供急需的竞争至关重要。
他说：“如果维珍澳大利亚航空失踪，澳洲航空将有效地垄断澳大利亚的天空。”
布兰森补充说，维珍航空将寻求英国政府的商业贷款，并将偿还，但没有提供所需资金的细节。

London (CNN Business) Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Australia will need government support if they're to survive the economic crisis triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.
Billionaire founder Richard Branson said Monday that the airlines need money from the UK and Australian governments to keep going "in the face of the severe uncertainty surrounding travel today," including the lack of clarity over how long planes will have to remain grounded.
IAG ICAGY Qantas QABSY In an open letter to employees, Branson said the survival of Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Australia was important to provide much needed competition to British Airways, ansubsidiary, and.
"If Virgin Australia disappears, Qantas would effectively have a monopoly of the Australian skies," he noted.
Virgin Atlantic will seek a commercial loan from the UK government, which it will repay, Branson added, without giving details of how much money it needs.

有一些独特的条件使油价首次跌破0美元。
更重要的是，原油价格只会对一加仑汽油的零售价格产生间接影响。
储存过多供应所需的空间即将用尽，这是导致周一油价下跌的部分原因。
相反，批发汽油价格决定了哪些加油站将为汽油付款。
甚至批发汽油期货也无法完全确定加油站为产品支付的价格。

There were some unique conditions driving oil prices below $0 for the first time ever.
And more importantly, crude oil prices only have an indirect impact on the retail price for a gallon of gasoline.
And the space needed to store that excess supply is running short, which is part of what led to the negative oil price on Monday.
Instead, wholesale gasoline prices that determine what gas stations will pay for gasoline.
And even wholesale gasoline futures don't fully determine the price that a gas station will pay for their product.

当搜捕行动结束约12小时后，这位51岁的枪手杀死了18人，其中包括一名警员，一名惩教官，一名护士和一名教师。

消息人士说，沃特曼在逃亡之前在这里杀死了两个人。
皮莱特说，持枪者在驾驶一辆看似警车的汽车时穿着皇家骑警制服或令人信服的复制品。

When the manhunt ended about 12 hours later, the 51-year-old gunman had killed 18 people, including a police constable, a corrections officer, a nurse and a teacher.
Wortman was killed in a shootout with police in Enfield, about 60 miles from the initial crime scene, Leather said.

香港（CNN商业版）冠状病毒大流行已经停止了全球电视节目和电影的制作，取消了旅行计划，禁止了聚会并推迟了拍摄。
然而，在澳大利亚，具有传奇色彩的肥皂剧《邻居》将于本周尽快恢复拍摄，并进行了一些创造性的调整。
为了使它们在屏幕上看起来都正常，他们将依靠巧妙的摄影方法和一些编辑魔术。
该剧以虚构的墨尔本郊区的居民为对象，随着澳大利亚冠状病毒感染激增，3月中旬首次停产。
该节目的执行制片人杰森·赫比森说：“演员和工作人员的健康和安全至高无上，我们一直严格遵守政府的指导方针。”

Hong Kong (CNN Business) The coronavirus pandemic has halted production on TV shows and movies around the world, with travel plans canceled, gatherings forbidden and shoots postponed.
In Australia, however, legendary soap opera "Neighbours" will resume filming as soon as this week — with a number of creative tweaks.
And to make it all look normal on screen, they'll rely on clever camerawork and some editing magic.
The drama, which follows the residents of a fictional suburb of Melbourne, first suspended production in mid-March as coronavirus infections in Australia surged.
"The health and safety of cast and crew is paramount and we have been following the government guidelines closely," said Jason Herbison, the show's executive producer.

美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）安娜·罗莎多（Ana Rosado）撰文：由于冠状病毒危机，皇家歌剧院目前已关闭，但您可以在此处在线观看表演。3月16日，伦敦的皇家歌剧院及其著名的舞蹈公司皇家芭蕾舞团在冠状病毒感染下向公众关闭大流行。
过去表演的免费在线广播使观众与皇家芭蕾舞团保持联系，但保持舞者活跃和相互联系构成了独特的挑战。

This means a kitchen bar may become a ballet barre, and an audience of thousands is temporarily shrunk to family members and pets.
To replicate the feel of the sprung floors she usually rehearses on, first soloist Anna Rose O'Sullivan has taken to practicing on a folded yoga mat "so I don't ruin my parents' floor and so it's safer," she said.

Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

但是，美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）采访了包括帕特里夏（Patricia）在内的五名十几岁和二十多岁的女性，他们声称格拉瑟（Glaser）在Bery's Place对其进行了性和情感虐待。
当女孩们反对时，他们说格拉泽会威胁要把他们赶出去。
一些幸存者说，格拉瑟（Glaser）介绍自己是一名医生，但支持起诉的律师告诉美国有线电视新闻网（CNN），他是物理治疗师-不是合格的医生。
Dilen于去年2月在Bery's Place进行的一次警察突袭中因警察的讯问而被捕，后来被释放。
但至少现在，他们说他们开始在贝里故居之外享受生活。

But five women in their late teens and early twenties interviewed by CNN, including Patricia, allege that Glaser sexually and emotionally abused them at Bery's Place.
When the girls objected, they say Glaser would threaten to cast them out on the streets.
Some survivors say Glaser introduced himself as a doctor, but lawyers supporting the prosecution told CNN that he is a physiotherapist -- not a qualified physician.
Dilen was arrested for questioning by police last February during a police raid at Bery's Place, and later released.
But for now, at least, they say they're beginning to enjoy their lives outside of Bery's Place.

假日营地变成了隔离营地-隔离饮食-温度检查和穿PPE的工作人员在隔离区生活-感觉就像在学校，营地和监狱中一样奇怪。
我的工厂位于鲤鱼门公园，通常是香港岛东部一个绿树成荫的度假村。
这个假日公园是香港用作冠状病毒检疫中心的几处设施之一。
在此之前，我已经在家工作了三个月-因此，在隔离营中做同样的事情并没有多大区别。
但这证明了香港政府对遏制从海外进口的案件并推回本地自满情绪的重视程度。

Holiday camp turned quarantine campLife in quarantine -- with its regimented meals, temperature checks and PPE-wearing staff -- feels like an odd mix of being in school, at camp, and in prison.
My facility, in Lei Yue Mun Park, is normally a leafy holiday village in the east of Hong Kong Island.
This holiday park is one of several facilities being used as coronavirus quarantine centers in Hong KongSince March, that number has surged.
Prior to now, I'd already been working from home for three months -- so doing the same from a quarantine camp hasn't made much of a difference.
But it's a testament to how serious the Hong Kong government is about clamping down on cases imported from overseas, and pushing back on local complacency.
