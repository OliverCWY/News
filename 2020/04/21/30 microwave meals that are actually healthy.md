We buy almost 80 million ready meals a week in the UK, but the humble microwave can be used for so much more than reheating leftovers and cups of tea. You can microwave lots of quick, homemade meals that are much healthier than the infamous 'microwave meal'.

The good news doesn't stop there. Contrary to popular belief, the microwave preserves more nutrients than traditional cooking methods such as boiling or roasting, thanks to the shorter cooking time.

Before you start cooking up a storm, pay attention to the strength and age of your microwave. The recipes below are tested in an 800W microwave. If your microwave is less powerful than this, you may need to cook the food for longer. If it's more powerful, you will need to reduce the cooking time slightly or start checking your food earlier. Even the best microwaves can cook food unevenly, so ensure all your food is cooked through.
