In order to minimise the suffering caused by Covid-19, global leaders are asking everyone to make sacrifices. People around the world are giving up, for a period, many of the things they love doing: visiting friends and family, travelling, shopping, congregating with others. It’s hard to do, but since governments are advising that this is the only responsible path to take, most people are taking it.

If there is one group of people whom you would expect to follow these new rules stringently, it would be the people issuing them. Politicians and government officials are more intently aware of the gravity of this situation than anyone, and have the added responsibility of setting an example for the rest of us. Why is it, then, that so many of them fail to take their own advice?

Scotland’s chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, was forced to resign after the press discovered that during lockdown she had made two separate trips to her second home, an hour’s drive from her family home in Edinburgh. In New Zealand, the health minister Dr David Clark was demoted after he broke national lockdown rules in order to take his family to the beach. In South Africa, a minister was suspended after being photographed having lunch with her friend.
