## 由于需求干燥，美国油价转为负数

这意味着石油生产商正在向买主付款，以免他们担心五月份的储存能力可能会耗尽。
结果，石油公司不得不租用油轮来存储剩余供应，这迫使美国石油价格跌至负数。
周一的大幅下跌部分是由于全球石油市场的技术性所致。
他说：“我对石油公司或石油价格的前景真的不乐观。”
她说：“我们不仅仅是一个交易市场；损失的每一分钱都意味着工作的不确定性增加。”

That means oil producers are paying buyers to take the commodity off their hands over fears that storage capacity could run out in May.
As a result, oil firms have resorted to renting tankers to store the surplus supply and that has forced the price of US oil into negative territory.
The severe drop on Monday was driven in part by a technicality of the global oil market.
"I'm really not optimistic about the prospects for oil companies or oil prices," he said.
"Ours is not just a trading market; every penny lost spells more uncertainty over jobs," she said.

去年在我们的太阳系中发现了星际彗星2I /鲍里索夫。
在该星际遮阳板中已经检测到HCN，并且其含量与太阳系彗星中的含量相似。
研究人员使用Alma进行观测，估计2I / Borisov的CO浓度比太阳系彗星的平均浓度高9到26倍。
这可能与星状系统中形成彗星的位置有关。
他解释说：“这些恒星具有与彗星鲍里索夫中发现的成分类型一样可能形成彗星的低温和光度。”

The interstellar comet 2I/Borisov was detected in our Solar System last year.
HCN has already been detected in this interstellar vistor, and is present at similar amounts to those found in Solar System comets.
The researchers using Alma for their observations estimated that 2I/Borisov's CO concentration was between nine and 26 times higher than that of an average Solar System comet.
This might be partly related to where in a star system a comet was formed.
"These stars have exactly the low temperatures and luminosities where a comet could form with the type of composition found in comet Borisov," he explained.

流行病是种族动态如何以复杂的方式（但仍未完全被理解）发挥作用的最新例子。
收入不平等在许多像美国这样的多数白人国家（以及像南非这样的少数白人国家）中，来自其他种族和种族群体的人们获得经济资源的机会越来越少，无论这意味着高薪工作还是全副食品。
这种经济脆弱性通常会转化为较差的健康结果。

In Chicago, as of early April 2020, 72% of people who died of coronavirus were black, although only one-third of the city’s population is.

The pandemic is the latest example of how racial dynamics play out in complex – and still not entirely understood – ways.
Income inequalityIn many majority-white countries like the US (as well as some minority-white countries like South Africa), people from other ethnic and racial groups have less access to economic resources – whether that means high-earning jobs or a full pantry.
That economic vulnerability often translates to poorer health outcomes.

霍雷克说：“真人秀汇集了许多不同的类型-肥皂剧，游戏节目，情节剧，脱口秀节目甚至体育节目。”
“某些关于Tinder并在大流行时代遥不可及的现实电视纪录片肯定会紧随其后。”热爱影视吗？

“In the face of the current world reality, ‘being confined together’ has gained a new meaning,” said Dourado.
On Friday, meanwhile, Netflix launched its latest addition to the reality TV genre, which offers its own skewed take on lockdown life.
“Reality TV has an intimacy which makes it quite powerful at this time.
“Reality TV brings together so many different genres – the soap opera, the gameshow, the melodrama, the talk show, even sport,” says Horeck.
“Some kind of Reality TV docu-series about Tinder and dating remotely in the age of the pandemic will surely be next.”Love film and TV?

法新社版权：AFPI印度尼西亚总统在伊斯兰斋月结束之际禁止穆斯林大规模外逃，以遏制冠状病毒的传播。
但是专家称此举为时已晚。
人们认为该国将近100万人离开了雅加达，回到了家乡和村庄。
许多人已经在斋月开始的几周前这样做了。
但是，健康专家警告说，鉴于偏远地区缺乏测试和适当的医疗保健设施，这可能是一场灾难。

AFP Copyright: AFPIndonesia's president has banned the mass exodus of Muslims at the end of the Islamic fasting month Ramadan, to try and curb the spread of coronavirus.
But it's a move that experts say comes too late.
Nearly one million people in the country are thought to have left Jakarta and returned to their hometowns and villages.
And many of them have done so weeks before Ramadan begins later this week.
However, health experts are warning it could be a disaster given the lack of testing and proper healthcare facilities in remote areas.

英国政府宣布了一项12.5亿英镑的一揽子计划，以支持不符合现有冠状病毒拯救计划的创新型新公司。
总理Rishi Sunak表示，在冠状病毒危机之后，初创企业将有助于推动英国的增长。
新成立的公司在成立初期往往会亏损，这使他们没有资格获得政府的紧急贷款计划。
该软件包受到了企业家社区的广泛欢迎，但是一些人警告说-与其他冠状病毒支持机制一样，复杂性是速度的敌人。
截至上周，在总额为3300亿英镑的一揽子援助计划中，已批准了超过10亿英镑的政府支持贷款。

Image copyright Getty ImagesThe government has announced a £1.25bn package to support innovative new companies that are not eligible for existing coronavirus rescue schemes.
Chancellor Rishi Sunak said start-ups would help power the UK's growth after the coronavirus crisis.
Newly-founded companies often lose money in their early years, which makes them ineligible for the government's emergency loan scheme.
The package has been broadly welcomed by the entrepreneur community but some have warned that - as with other coronavirus support mechanisms - complexity is the enemy of speed.
As of last week, just over £1bn in government-backed loans had been approved out of a total support package of £330bn.

早在1918年，维克（Vick）的VapoRub广告上就刊登了令人放心的事实标题：“西班牙流感-它是什么以及应如何对待。”
这次，主题是“增强”免疫系统。
（请阅读更多有关香料可以影响您健康的证据，以及热饮如何无法保护您免受Covid-19的侵害）。
没有增强免疫力的东西。不幸的是，丸，新潮的超级食品或健康习惯可以为健康的免疫系统提供捷径的想法是一个神话。
实际上，“增强”免疫系统的概念没有任何科学意义。

“Spanish Influenza – what it is and how it should be treated,” read the reassuringly factual headline to an advert for Vick’s VapoRub back in 1918.
This time, the theme is “boosting” the immune system.
(Read more about what evidence exists for the idea that spices can affect your health, and how hot drinks will not protect you from Covid-19).
There’s no such thing as boosted immunityUnfortunately, the idea that pills, trendy superfoods or wellness habits can provide a shortcut to a healthy immune system is a myth.
In fact, the concept of “boosting” your immune system doesn’t hold any scientific meaning whatsoever.

为了最大程度地减少Covid-19所造成的痛苦，全球领导人要求所有人做出牺牲。
一段时间以来，世界各地的人们都放弃了自己喜欢做的​​许多事情：拜访朋友和家人，旅行，购物，与他人聚会。
那么，为什么这么多人没有采纳自己的建议呢？
在新西兰，卫生部长戴维·克拉克（David Clark）博士因违反国家禁闭规定以将家人带到海滩而被降职。
在南非，一位部长被拍照与她的朋友共进午餐后被停职。

In order to minimise the suffering caused by Covid-19, global leaders are asking everyone to make sacrifices.
People around the world are giving up, for a period, many of the things they love doing: visiting friends and family, travelling, shopping, congregating with others.
Why is it, then, that so many of them fail to take their own advice?
In New Zealand, the health minister Dr David Clark was demoted after he broke national lockdown rules in order to take his family to the beach.
In South Africa, a minister was suspended after being photographed having lunch with her friend.

这是一部浪漫浪漫喜剧的肮脏前提，但这并不能阻止Pretty Woman成为1990年最受欢迎的喜剧之一。
在《漂亮女人》中，他没有接Vivian是因为他需要“放松”，而是因为他需要返回贝弗利威尔希尔酒店的路线。
相比较而言，《漂亮女人》的评论则较为审慎：这是一部有关性工作者的电影，主要针对随意性进行审查。
他们做了《漂亮女人》所做的事情，就是让观看者拿到客房服务的草莓并吃掉它们。
薇薇安（Vivian）谈论很多关于安全的性行为，这就是“漂亮女人”（Pretty Woman）的卖点：完全安全的性行为。

It’s a sordid premise for a feel-good romantic comedy, but that didn’t stop Pretty Woman being one of the biggest hits of 1990.
In Pretty Woman, he doesn’t pick up Vivian because he needs to “relax”, but because he needs directions back to the Beverly Wilshire hotel.
Pretty Woman is positively prudish in comparison: a film about a sex worker which is primly censorious about casual sex.
They do what Pretty Woman did, which is to let the viewer have their room-service strawberries and eat them, too.
Vivian talks a lot about safe sex, and that’s what Pretty Woman is selling: sex which is utterly safe.

苏塞克斯公爵夫人（Duchess of Sussex）透露了她和哈里王子在结婚前发给她父亲的短信，这是对星期日邮递出版者采取法律行动的一部分。
梅根（Meghan）声称，《美联社》（Associated Newspapers）错误地引用了这些信息，使这对夫妇的绘画不太好。
梅根（Meghan）于周日在《邮件》中发表了一封给父亲托马斯·马克尔（Thomas Markle）的手写信，提起了法律诉讼。
包含短信的法院文件已经提交，预计在本周晚些时候举行听证会。

Meghan claims Associated Newspapers misquoted the messages to paint the couple in a less good light.
Meghan brought the legal action after a handwritten letter she sent to her father, Thomas Markle, was published in the Mail on Sunday.
Court papers containing the text messages have been filed ahead of an expected hearing later this week.
On 14 May 2018, it says, Mr Markle sent Meghan a text message to apologise and confirm that he would not be attending the wedding.

自从冠状病毒被封锁以来，“无法入睡”的主题标签一直在流行，传说人们在努力地整夜低头。
“在封锁之前，我会像日志一样睡觉。
她说：“通常情况下，它会很早醒来，去健身房，去上班，然后去健身房睡觉。”
“例程是良好睡眠的守护者。
但是凯文说，尽管饮酒可以帮助我们更快入睡，但长期来看并不好。

Since the coronavirus lockdown, the hashtag "can't sleep" has been trending, with tales of people struggling to get their heads down for the night.
"Before the lockdown, I would sleep like a log.
"Normally, it's wake up early, go to the gym, go to work, then gym and sleep," she says.
"Routine is the guardian of good sleep.
But Kevin says that while alcohol can help us get to sleep faster, it's not good in the long-term.

我们每周在英国购买近8000万份即食食品，但是不起眼的微波炉不仅可以用来加热剩饭和喝杯茶，还可以用于更多用途。
您可以微波烹饪许多快速的自制食物，而这些食物比臭名昭著的“微波食物”要健康得多。
在开始准备暴风雨之前，请注意微波炉的强度和寿命。
如果您的微波炉的功率不足，则可能需要煮更长的时间。
即使是最好的微波炉，也会使食物烹饪不均匀，因此请确保将所有食物煮熟。

We buy almost 80 million ready meals a week in the UK, but the humble microwave can be used for so much more than reheating leftovers and cups of tea.
You can microwave lots of quick, homemade meals that are much healthier than the infamous 'microwave meal'.
Before you start cooking up a storm, pay attention to the strength and age of your microwave.
If your microwave is less powerful than this, you may need to cook the food for longer.
Even the best microwaves can cook food unevenly, so ensure all your food is cooked through.
