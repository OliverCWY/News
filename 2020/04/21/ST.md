甚至不计入5月合约暴跌的可能性到负价，实物石油世界也显示出普遍的痛苦。
相关故事什么是负原油价格，对消费者意味着什么？
对于亲自促成欧佩克+交易的特朗普先生来说，负价意味着美国石油市场将面临更多麻烦。
但是市场-负价格以及所有价格-并没有在等待欧佩克削减产量或等待关税减缓进口。
周一空前的石油市场暴跌不是孤立事件，而是警告人们将要遭受更多痛苦。

Even discounting the oddity of the May contract's plunge into negative prices, the world of physical oil suggests widespread pain.

For Mr Trump, who personally brokered the Opec+ deal, negative prices means more trouble in the US oil patch.
But the market - negative prices and all - isn't waiting for Opec to cut production, or for tariffs to slow imports.
Rather than being an isolated event, Monday's unprecedented oil market plunge serves as a warning of more pain to come.

收款人是梁良，这是石油交易中最有力和最秘密的名字之一。
熟悉林先生的资深石油市场主管豪尔赫·蒙特佩克说：“兴隆是一家喜欢冒险的公司。”
巨大的后果显良市的消亡对真正推动全球贸易的市场产生了深远的影响。
正在为兴隆提供建议的Rajah＆Tann发言人表示，由于此事已提交法院，因此无法发表评论。
是否可以或想为Hin Leong设计解决方案仍有待观察。

On the receiving end was Hin Leong, one of the most powerful and secretive names in oil trading.
"Hin Leong is a company that likes risk," said Mr Jorge Montepeque, a veteran oil market executive who knows Mr Lim.
HUGE CONSEQUENCESThe demise of Hin Leong has far-reaching repercussions for a market that literally fuels global trade.
A spokesman for Rajah & Tann, which is advising Hin Leong, said it's unable to comment because the matter is before the court.
Whether it can or wants to engineer a solution for Hin Leong remains to be seen.

维珍澳大利亚航空（Virgin Australia）加入了FlyBe（英国上个月倒闭前最大的国内航空公司），成为该病毒对该行业造成的企业伤亡之一。
维珍澳大利亚航空（Virgin Australia）已经解散了其10,000名员工中的80％，将继续为基本工人，货运和澳大利亚人遣返提供一些航班。
维珍澳大利亚航空几乎完全由外国航空公司所有，是航空方面的独特实验。
据《澳大利亚金融评论》上周报道，至少有两个收购集团正准备收购维珍澳大利亚航空。
部长们再三表示，他们的目标是在澳大利亚拥有两家相互竞争的航空公司，不过他们并没有挑出维珍澳大利亚航空来寻求任何特殊帮助。

Virgin Australia joins FlyBe - the UK's biggest domestic airline before it collapsed last month - as one of the industry's corporate casualties of the virus.
Virgin Australia, which had already furloughed 80 per cent of its 10,000-strong workforce, will continue to operate some flights for essential workers, freight and the repatriation of Australians.
Almost entirely owned by foreign airlines, Virgin Australia is a unique experiment in aviation.
At least two buyout groups were preparing to take over Virgin Australia, the Australian Financial Review reported last week.
Ministers repeatedly said their goal is to have two competing airlines in Australia, though stopped short of singling out Virgin Australia for any special help.

卫生部还表示，周一新开的1,426例新冠状病毒病例中，有1,369例是居住在宿舍的外国工人。
卫生部解释说，由于进行了广泛的测试，卫生部正在从宿舍里收拾更多案件。
这些病例大多数患有轻度疾病，并在社区隔离设施或医院的普通病房中进行监控。
截至周一，居住在宿舍的323,000名外籍工人中有1.9％（即6,075例）经检测呈阳性。
这意味着这里有四分之三的冠状病毒病例与宿舍有关。

The ministry also said that 1,369 of the 1,426 new coronavirus cases on Monday are foreign workers living in dormitories.
MOH explained that it is picking up many more cases from dormitories because of extensive testing.
Most of these cases have a mild illness and are being monitored in community isolation facilities or the general wards of hospitals.
As of Monday, 1.9 per cent of the 323,000 foreign workers living in dormitories, or 6,075 cases have tested positive for the virus.
This means three in four of all coronavirus cases here are linked to dormitories.

特德罗斯博士在日内瓦举行的虚拟简报会上说：“从第一天起，我们就警告说，这是每个人都应该战斗的魔鬼。”
特德罗斯博士说，在世卫组织日内瓦总部工作的嵌入式美国政府借调人员的存在意味着华盛顿没有任何隐瞒。
这是自然而然的事，他们会告诉自己在做什么，”特德罗斯博士说。
但是特德罗斯博士坚持认为，世界卫生组织已经意识到武汉的报告，并表示台湾的电子邮件只是在寻求进一步的信息。
特德罗斯博士还敦促领导人不要为自己的政治资本利用这一流行病。

"We have been warning from day one that this is a devil that everyone should fight," Dr Tedros told a virtual briefing in Geneva.
Dr Tedros said the presence of embedded US government secondees working at the WHO headquarters in Geneva meant there was nothing being concealed from Washington.
It just comes naturally and they tell what they are doing," said Dr Tedros.
But Dr Tedros insisted that the WHO was already aware of reports emanating from Wuhan – and said Taiwan’s e-mail was only seeking further information.
Dr Tedros also urged leaders not to exploit the pandemic for their own political capital.

华盛顿（路透社）-美国总统唐纳德·特朗普周一表示，他将通过一项行政命令暂时中止所有移民到美国，以应对冠状病毒的爆发并保护美国的工作。
特朗普表示，他正在采取行动保护美国劳动力。
无论如何，由于边界限制和随着病毒在全球范围内传播而实施的飞行禁令，移民在很大程度上被阻止进入美国。
特朗普先生在2016年赢得了白宫殊荣，部分原因是他承诺通过在美国与墨西哥边界上修建隔离墙来遏制移民。
美国是世界上确诊的冠状病毒病例最多的国家，感染人数超过780,000，比周一增加了27,000。

WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - US President Donald Trump said on Monday he will suspend all immigration into the United States temporarily through an executive order in response to the coronavirus outbreak and to protect American jobs.
Mr Trump said he was taking the action to protect the US workforce.
Immigration is largely halted into the United States anyway thanks to border restrictions and flight bans put in place as the virus spread across the globe.
Mr Trump won the White House in 2016 in part on a promise to curb immigration by building a wall on the US border with Mexico.
The United States has the world’s largest number of confirmed coronavirus cases, with more than 780,000 infections, up 27,000 on Monday.

香港（路透社）-中国统治城市的领导人林家慧（Carrie Lam）周二（4月21日）表示，香港政府将把针对冠状病毒的社会限制再延长14天。
从3月29日起，香港禁止在14天之内举行超过4人的公开集会，后来将该限制延长至4月23日。
香港避免了在其他地方看到的指数感染，并因社区的强烈反应而赢得赞誉，这归因于香港经历了2003年的严重急性呼吸系统综合症（Sars）流行病。
香港于1997年以“一国两制”的方式重返北京统治，保证了其高度自治。
之前为香港制定国家安全法（第23条）的尝试在2003年遭到了大规模抗议，并被放弃。

HONG KONG (REUTERS) - Hong Kong's government will extend social restrictions aimed at tackling the coronavirus for another 14 days, the China-ruled city's leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday (April 21).
Hong Kong banned public gatherings of more than four people for 14 days from March 29 and later extended that restriction until April 23.
Hong Kong has avoided the exponential infections seen elsewhere and won praise for a strong community response, attributed to the city’s experience with the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) epidemic.
Hong Kong returned to Beijing rule in 1997 under a "one country, two systems" formula that guarantees it a high degree of autonomy.
A previous attempt to draft a national security law for Hong Kong, known as Article 23, was met with mass protests in 2003 and abandoned.

华盛顿（路透社）-纽约市市长比尔·德布拉西奥（Bill de Blasio）周一（4月20日）表示，由于缺乏广泛的测试，该国人口最多的城市可能需要数周甚至数月才能重新开放，即使其他地方的官员开始放宽限制在日常生活中。
德布拉西奥先生所在的城市位于美国冠状病毒危机的中心。他说，纽约需要每天进行成千上万次检查，以确保住院率在进一步恢复经济之前进一步下降。

WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday (April 20) that it could take weeks if not months before the country's most populous city reopens due to a lack of widespread testing, even as officials elsewhere began rolling back restrictions on daily life.
Mr de Blasio, whose city is at the epicentre of the coronavirus crisis in the United States, said New York needed to be conducting hundreds of thousands of tests a day and to see hospitalisations decline further before reopening the economy.
An estimated 2,500 people rallied at the Washington state capitol in Olympia to protest Democratic Governor Jay Inslee's stay-at-home order, one of several protests.
Residents in Florida were allowed to return to some beaches after Governor Ron DeSantis approved the relaxing of some restrictions.
"We thought that the public was ready to maintain the social distancing standards and to exercise good judgment.

柏林/法兰克福（路透社）-德国人于周一（4月20日）返回商店，在封锁一个月后渴望零售疗法，但总理安格拉·默克尔（Angela Merkel）敦促他们保持纪律，以免在与冠状病毒的斗争中复发。

Germany's southern neighbour Austria took a first step in relaxing restrictions last Tuesday by letting DIY stores, garden centres and smaller shops reopen, and plans to reopen museums and libraries from mid-May.
But when all schools reopen, classes will be split into two halves that each alternate between a week in school and a week studying at home.
The government has tried to cushion the economic effect of the shutdown with measures including a €750 billion (S$1.16 trillion) stimulus package.

吉隆坡-虽然马来西亚看到希望的迹象表明它正在慢慢赢得打破冠状病毒感染链的战斗，但其庞大的移民工人群体仍存在不确定性。
东南亚第三大经济体拥有220万记录在册的外国工人，以及330万非法工人及其家庭。
在新加坡新案件激增之后，对移民工人进行测试的呼声越来越高，这在很大程度上影响了低薪移民工人。
但是，与新加坡的农民工大多居住在宿舍里使他们更容易找到和测试他们不同，大多数马来西亚籍的外国工人为自己的居住区付款，因此他们分散了。
卫生部总干事努尔·希瑟姆·阿卜杜拉（Noor Hisham Abdullah）博士周一（4月20日）表示，他希望加强外国工人的检测。

KUALA LUMPUR - While Malaysia is seeing hopeful signs that it is slowly winning the battle to break the chain of coronavirus infections, uncertainty hangs over its large group of migrant workers.
South-east Asia's third biggest economy is host to 2.2 million documented foreign workers, and another 3.3 million illegal workers and their families.
The call to conduct tests on migrant workers grew louder recently following the surge in new cases in Singapore mostly affecting low-wage migrant workers.
But unlike Singapore's migrant workers who are mostly housed in dormitories making it easier to locate and test them, most Malaysia-based foreign workers pay for their own living quarters and they are thus widely dispersed.
The health ministry's director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said on Monday (April 20) that he hoped to boost testing among foreign workers.
