Indonesia's president has banned the mass exodus of Muslims at the end of the Islamic fasting month Ramadan, to try and curb the spread of coronavirus.

But it's a move that experts say comes too late.

Nearly one million people in the country are thought to have left Jakarta and returned to their hometowns and villages. And many of them have done so weeks before Ramadan begins later this week.

For many in the world’s most-populous Muslim-majority nation, it is unthinkable not to return to their families back home, Indonesians have a unique ceremony during Eid called halal-bi-halal, a social gathering where people ask for mutual forgiveness from each other.

On Eid, which falls at the end of May this year, football fields, parking lots, and neighborhood alleys would usually be transformed into outdoor mosques to host mass Eid prayers, where many would flaunt their new clothes and prayer dresses.

However, health experts are warning it could be a disaster given the lack of testing and proper healthcare facilities in remote areas.

"During Ramadan we are supposed to be joyful, but some of us will end up in hospital, and some of us will die, because of circumstances that we can actually prevent," says epidemologist Pandu Riono of the University of Indonesia.
