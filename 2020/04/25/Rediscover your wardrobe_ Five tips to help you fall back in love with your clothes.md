“We’re all going through this experience in a slightly different way and probably going through different moments of the experience at different times. For me, I’ve worked from home for a long time but I’ve been finding it really difficult to motivate myself and I have to confess, when we first went into lockdown I was in my pyjamas quite a lot. I work from home normally, so it was kind of odd to me why I couldn’t motivate myself.

“I found personally that getting dressed purposefully has really given me a bit of a spring in my step, lifted me for the day and made me feel like I’m in the zone to get on with my day. I’ve actually got this green olive silk suit that I’ve been wearing quite a bit, especially to jump onto calls, which is really comfortable and it feels really beautiful on my skin. Wearing bright colours, wearing things that feel comfortable but also beautiful and that you love really make you feel good.

“I’ve also got something of my Nan’s that I’ve been wearing. Obviously we can’t see our grandparents at the moment so it’s quite nice to wear things that make you feel closer to your family.”
