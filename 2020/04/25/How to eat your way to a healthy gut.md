As many countries urge populations to stay at home, many of us are paying more attention to our diets and how the food we eat can support our health. To help sort out the fact from the fiction, BBC Future is updating some of our most popular nutrition stories from our archive.

Our colleagues at BBC Good Food are focusing on practical solutions for ingredient swaps, nutritious storecupboard recipes and all aspects of cooking and eating during lockdown.

It’s not hard to stumble across any number of articles and papers proclaiming the next wonder food to improve your gut health. As scientists increasingly discover the central role that gut bacteria play in our overall health, it’s tempting to latch on to these promises to try to revitalise everything from your weight to mental wellbeing.

But the science has a way to go before we know exactly what nutrition is best for your gut. BBC Future spoke to leading gut health and microbiome researchers to sift fact from fiction on gut health "wonder foods", probiotics, prebiotics and what changes to your diet could genuinely boost your gut health.

The interest in how to improve your gut health is so high because recent advances have begun to unpick how the microbiome affects many conditions beyond those affecting the digestive system. Studies have linked gut bacteria – known collectively as the microbiome – to changes in mood and mental health, tendency to obesity and to cardiovascular health. For people who want to maintain a healthy weight and mental health, the goal would be a way to "hack" their gut bacteria.

"The general belief is that a diverse gut microbiota is a synonym for health, since [these bacteria] are helping us produce nutrients and essential substances that our cells cannot," says Sonia Fonseca, a researcher studying the interactions between the diet, gut, microbiome and brain at the Quadram Institute. "So feeding our microbes with a diverse diet and creating a comfortable environment for them seems the right thing to do."

But finding a way to hack your microbiome might be harder than it sounds. For one thing, like much of health research, even though a study finds a link between one food and an improvement in gut bacteria, it doesn't mean that food has caused the change in the microbiome.

"Many studies are based on finding correlations, which even sometimes are contradictory, but only a few are interested in explaining causation," says Fonseca. "That is the challenging part."

While headlines may be moving faster than solid science, some clear trends are emerging on things we can do to make a real impact on gut health, says Kevin Whelan, professor of dietetics at King's College London. The majority of evidence supports that there are four main ways to do this.

Probiotics

The first is taking foods or supplements with probiotic bacteria in them. These are bacteria that are generally thought to be part of a healthy microbiome – particularly common ones in supplements and "live" yoghurts (meaning they contain living bacteria) are called bifidobacteria and lactobacillus.

"In general, what we know is that if you take a probiotic yoghurt with those bacteria, we know it will increase the number of those strains in your gut," says Whelan.
