Then this past week we started getting another 200 more on top of that, taking us to 500 a day. People are confined to their homes without much else to do, so are returning to more homely, traditional pastimes like baking with their children, trying out home-made bread and experimenting with their own sourdough starters. Last Monday we got orders for 7,272lbs (3,300kg) of flour in small retail packages. At the same time our wholesale demand has only declined a little bit – it turns out that bakers are very resourceful about how they get bread to their customers.
