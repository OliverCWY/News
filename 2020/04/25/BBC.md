路透社图片标题路透社佐治亚州允许沙龙和水疗中心重新开放，美国为遏制冠状病毒的传播采取了措施之后，美国的一些死亡人数已超过51,000，美国三个州允许一些商店重新开放。
沙龙和水疗中心可能会在佐治亚州和俄克拉荷马州重新开放，而阿拉斯加取消对餐馆的限制。
在受到特朗普先生的批评之后，佐治亚州州长布莱恩·肯普（Brian Kemp）收紧了餐馆的一些卫生和社会隔离要求。
美国迄今为止是世界上死亡人数和病例数最高的国家-超过50,000例死亡和890,000例确诊病例。
可能的Covid-19死亡是符合临床和流行病学标准但未经测试证实的死亡。

Salons and spas could reopen in Georgia and Oklahoma while Alaska lifted restrictions on restaurants.
After being criticised by Mr Trump, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp tightened some of the sanitation and social distancing requirements for restaurants.
The US has by far the highest death toll and case count in the world - more than 50,000 deaths and 890,000 confirmed cases.
A probable Covid-19 death is one that meets clinical and epidemiological criteria but has not been confirmed by testing.

视频周四，在白宫冠状病毒特别工作组简报会上，唐纳德·特朗普总统提出了关于是否可以通过向体内注射消毒剂来治疗Covid-19的建议，从而引起了广泛的批评。
他似乎还提议用紫外线照射患者的身体，这一想法被德博拉·伯克斯（Deborah Birx）博士在简报会上驳回。
星期五，特朗普总统说他的评论是“讽刺的”。
但是，医生警告说，有些人可能会把总统的评论放在心上。
乔纳森·斯派塞（Jonathan Spicer）博士在接受BBC采访时警告说：“这些产品具有腐蚀性，会熔化或破坏我们内脏的内层。”

VideoOn Thursday, during the White House coronavirus taskforce briefing, President Donald Trump attracted widespread criticism after he suggested research into whether Covid-19 might be treated by injecting disinfectant into the body.
He also appeared to propose irradiating patients' bodies with UV light, an idea dismissed by Dr Deborah Birx at the briefing.
On Friday, President Trump said his comments had been made "sarcastically".
However, doctors warned that some people might take the president's comments to heart.
Speaking to the BBC, Dr Jonathan Spicer warned that "these products have corrosive properties that melt or destroy the lining of our innards."

从瑞典公共卫生署的角度来看，人们的回应方式虽然值得谨慎，但值得庆祝。
但是，瑞典公共卫生署在整个大流行中都保持了很高的认可率。
此外，瑞典公共卫生署（Swedish Public Health Agency）提早提出了这一想法，因为很大一部分病例可能是轻度的。
与某些国家不同，瑞典的统计数据确实包括敬老院居民，这些人约占所有死亡人数的50％。
斯德哥尔摩大学数学家汤姆·布里顿（Tom Britton）表示，它甚至可能多达瑞典的一半人口。

Viewed through the eyes of the Swedish Public Health Agency, the way people have responded is one to be celebrated, albeit cautiously.
But the Swedish Public Health Agency has maintained high approval ratings throughout the pandemic.
Image copyright BBC NewsIn addition, the Swedish Public Health Agency pushed the idea early on that a large proportion of cases were likely to be mild.
Unlike in some countries, Sweden's statistics do include elderly care home residents, who account for around 50% of all deaths.
It could even be up to half the population of Sweden, suggests Stockholm University mathematician Tom Britton.

杜拉多说：“面对当前的世界现实，'被束缚在一起'获得了新的含义。”
与此同时，周五，Netflix推出了真人秀电视类型的最新成员，它对锁定生活提出了自己的偏见。
“真人秀电视具有一种亲密感，使其在此时具有强大的功能。
霍雷克说：“真人秀汇集了许多不同的类型-肥皂剧，游戏节目，情节剧，脱口秀节目甚至体育节目。”
“某些关于Tinder并在大流行时代遥不可及的现实电视纪录片肯定会紧随其后。”热爱影视吗？

“In the face of the current world reality, ‘being confined together’ has gained a new meaning,” said Dourado.
On Friday, meanwhile, Netflix launched its latest addition to the reality TV genre, which offers its own skewed take on lockdown life.
“Reality TV has an intimacy which makes it quite powerful at this time.
“Reality TV brings together so many different genres – the soap opera, the gameshow, the melodrama, the talk show, even sport,” says Horeck.
“Some kind of Reality TV docu-series about Tinder and dating remotely in the age of the pandemic will surely be next.”Love film and TV?

自3月12日以来，比利时一直处于封锁状态比利时总理索菲·威尔梅斯宣布了一项逐步取消该国冠状病毒限制的详细计划。
在1,140万人中，有近6,700人死亡，是欧洲人均死亡率最高的国家。
但是，与其他欧洲国家进行比较可能会产生误导，因为据信某些国家的死亡报告不足。
经过周五数小时的讨论，威尔梅斯总理宣布了逐步结束该国封锁的时间表，该时间表始于3月12日。
星期五，捷克共和国结束了为限制冠状病毒传播而对自由流动的限制。

Almost 6,700 deaths have been recorded in the nation of 11.4 million - the highest rate per capita in Europe.
Comparisons with other European countries may be somewhat misleading, however, as some countries are believed to be under-reporting deaths.
After hours of discussions on Friday, Prime Minister Wilmès announced a timetable to gradually end the country's lockdown, which began on 12 March.
On Friday, the Czech Republic ended restrictions on free movement which had been put in place to help halt the spread of coronavirus.

后来，詹金斯先生得知他们是22名受害者中的两名，这是加拿大历史上最大的大规模枪击事件。
一直以来，詹金斯先生都很想知道他女儿发生了什么，但也害怕他会学到什么。
住在波塔皮克沃特曼附近的南希·哈德森告诉《国家邮报》，沃特曼“非常快乐”，但“他有另一面”。
詹金斯（Jenkins）的女儿阿兰娜（Alanna）被杀，并没有引起人们的支持。

Their two Labrador retrievers also died, Mr Jenkins says.
Later, Mr Jenkins would learn they were two of 22 victims, the largest mass shooting in Canadian history.
All the while, Mr Jenkins was desperate to know what had happened to his daughter, but also afraid of what he might learn.
Nancy Hudson, who lived near Wortman in Portapique, told the National Post that Wortman was "very jovial" but that "he had another side".
The support has not gone unnoticed by Mr Jenkins, whose daughter Alanna was killed.

世界主要航空公司几乎停止了世界各地的客运。

2018年，法荷航的客运量突破1亿。

The French authorities said Air France would get €3bn in loans and another €4bn in state-guaranteed funds.
Major world airlines all but halted passenger traffic around the world.
Earlier this year, Air France-KLM estimated the outbreak would cost the group between €150m and €200m in February-April.
Faced with the upheaval the world is going through, we are going to have to rethink our model immediately," he added.
In 2018, Air France-KLM's passenger traffic exceeded 100 million.

但是詹姆斯爵士告诉他的员工，目前只有四分之一的人在使用这些东西。
就在一个多月前，在Covid-19流行期间，该国似乎正面临着严重的通风机短缺。
据詹姆斯·戴森爵士说，根本不再需要他的设备。

But Sir James told his staff that only a quarter of those available were currently being used.
Just over a month ago, it looked as though the country was facing an acute shortage of ventilators during the Covid-19 epidemic.
According to Sir James Dyson, his devices simply aren't needed any more.

图片说明：Debenhams在威尔士包括加的夫在内的多个地点都有商店。Debenhams已警告威尔士财政部长，除非政府撤销关于降低商业利率的决定，否则将被迫关闭在威尔士的主要商店。
它说，这种变化意味着企业费率将用于向小企业提供赠款。
“除非您撤销决定，否则它将无法重新开设商店。”
根据房地产服务公司Altus Group的数据，在本财政年度，Debenhams在威尔士的商业利率负债为235万英镑。
同时，有迹象表明，在该公司未能与房东达成交易之后，另外四家Debenhams商店将不会在锁定后重新营业。

"It will be unable to reopen its stores unless you reverse your decision."
According to real estate services firm Altus Group, Debenhams has business rates liabilities in Wales of £2.35m for the current financial year.
Meanwhile, it has emerged that four more Debenhams stores will not reopen post-lockdown, after the business failed to agree deals with landlords.

研究已经将肠道细菌（统称为微生物组）与情绪和心理健康的变化，肥胖症的倾向以及心血管健康联系起来。
对于想要保持健康体重和精神健康的人们来说，目标将是“砍伐”肠道细菌的一种方法。

Studies have linked gut bacteria – known collectively as the microbiome – to changes in mood and mental health, tendency to obesity and to cardiovascular health.
For people who want to maintain a healthy weight and mental health, the goal would be a way to "hack" their gut bacteria.

工作忙碌起来，进行一对一的会议，然后，当您完成一天的工作后，与朋友和家人进行环聊。
自从Covid-19大流行以来，我们正在进行的视频通话比以往任何时候都多，而且许多人发现它已经筋疲力尽。
视频聊天难吗？
Petriglieri说，进行视频通话比面对面聊天需要更多的注意力。
视频聊天意味着我们需要更加努力地处理非语言提示，例如面部表情，声音的音调和音调以及肢体语言。多关注这些会消耗大量能量。

There are the work huddles, the one-on-one meetings and then, once you’re done for the day, the hangouts with friends and family.
Since the Covid-19 pandemic hit, we’re on video calls more than ever before – and many are finding it exhausting.
Is video chat harder?
Being on a video call requires more focus than a face-to-face chat, says Petriglieri.
Video chats mean we need to work harder to process non-verbal cues like facial expressions, the tone and pitch of the voice, and body language; paying more attention to these consumes a lot of energy.

Last Monday we got orders for 7,272lbs (3,300kg) of flour in small retail packages.
At the same time our wholesale demand has only declined a little bit – it turns out that bakers are very resourceful about how they get bread to their customers.

根据贝恩科克的说法，它是“目前地球上最活跃的火山”，即使在30公里以外的地方，它也是可见的存在，并且是动荡的威胁。
但是，仍然在他的桌子上方的墙上挂着一个耶稣受难像，在角落里，他收集了十几个埃特纳火山熔岩的岩石中，摆着一个微型耶稣诞生的场景。

“An earthquake, on the south side of Etna,” said volcanologist Boris Behncke as he pointed to a line that violently jerked to a squiggle.
Here, like in many places on the east side of Sicily, Mt Etna looms large over daily life.
According to Behncke, it is “currently the most active volcano on Earth” and even at over 30km away, it is a visible presence and a volatile threat.
But still, above his desk a crucifix hangs on the wall and in the corner, among his collection of a dozen or so rocks of Etna lava sits a miniature nativity scene.

然而，在将乐队卖给推销商和演出场所时，杜克洛斯并没有提到“美国甲壳虫”这一部​​分。
当主持人发布开幕词时，美国甲壳虫在摄像机，吉他和木棍的后面等待着准备就绪。
“当他们广播时，是的-人们意识到他们不是真正的甲壳虫，而是假甲壳虫。”
美国甲壳虫是“ anlolodic”，“ how叫作曲家”，并且与los pelucones进行了比较，los pelucones是19世纪智利戴假发的保守派。
但是对于成千上万的现在已经成年的Beatlemaniacos，美国甲壳虫将在他们的心中占据一个持久的-无疑是离奇的-地位。

Yet in selling the group to promoters and venues, Duclós hadn’t quite mentioned the 'American Beetles' part.
The American Beetles waited behind the camera, guitars and sticks at the ready, as the host issued his opening proclamation.
"When they went on air, yes – the people realised that they were not the real Beatles, but the fake Beatles."
The American Beetles were 'antimelodic', 'howling songwriters', and drew comparisons to los pelucones, the wig-wearing conservatives of 19th-Century Chile.
But for thousands of now-elderly Beatlemaniacos, The American Beetles will hold an enduring – and no doubt bizarre – place in their hearts.

没有迹象表明人们在没有某些（通常是至关重要的）成分时会放弃。
没问题！
坚定的厨师证明，即使没有面粉，您也无法阻止面包师。
Banoffee派像大多数未烘烤的芝士蛋糕一样，在底部使用饼干代替面粉。
如果您没有饼干，那么纳迪亚·侯赛因（Nadiya Hussain）会用巧克力和薯片打碎蛋art。

There’s no sign of people giving up when they don’t have certain (often crucial) ingredients.
No problem\!
Determined cooks are proving you can’t hold back a baker, even without flour.
Banoffee pie uses biscuits instead of flour in the base, like most no-bake cheesecakes.
If you don’t have biscuits, Nadiya Hussain makes a cracking tart base with chocolate and crisps.

“我们都以略有不同的方式来经历这种体验，并且可能在不同的时间经历着不同的体验时刻。
我实际上已经穿了这套绿色的橄榄色真丝西服，尤其是为了接听电话，这套衣服真的很舒适，而且在我的皮肤上感觉真的很漂亮。
穿着鲜艳的色彩，穿上既舒适又美丽的衣服，并且您所爱的人确实会让您感觉良好。
“我还穿了一些我穿的南衣服。
显然，目前我们看不到祖父母，因此穿上让您与家人更亲近的衣服真是太好了。”

“We’re all going through this experience in a slightly different way and probably going through different moments of the experience at different times.
I’ve actually got this green olive silk suit that I’ve been wearing quite a bit, especially to jump onto calls, which is really comfortable and it feels really beautiful on my skin.
Wearing bright colours, wearing things that feel comfortable but also beautiful and that you love really make you feel good.
“I’ve also got something of my Nan’s that I’ve been wearing.
Obviously we can’t see our grandparents at the moment so it’s quite nice to wear things that make you feel closer to your family.”
