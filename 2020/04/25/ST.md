一名男子下车后，才允许她上车。
QR码具有双重目的：确保输入的任何人都是健康的，并且在有需要时也用于联系人追踪。
上个月末，牛津大学的科学家建议其他政府在《科学》杂志发表的一份报告中考虑采用这种“数字联系追踪”。
他们说，这种病毒的传播速度太快，以至于传统的接触者追踪方法无法发挥作用，但如果该过程“更快，更有效且大规模发生”，则可以控制。
张女士说：“有时移动连接速度很慢，加载时间很长。”

A man alights from the bus to take her temperature before she is allowed to board.
The QR codes serve a dual purpose: to ensure anyone entering is healthy, and also for contact tracing purposes should the need arise.
Late last month, scientists from Oxford University recommended other governments consider adopting such "digital contact tracing" in a report published in Science journal.
They said the virus is spreading far too quickly for traditional contact tracing methods to work but could be controlled if the process was "faster, more efficient and happened at scale".
"There are times the mobile connection is slow and it takes a long time to load," Ms Zhang said.

北京/首尔（路透社）-据三位知情人士说，中国已向包括医疗专家在内的朝鲜派遣了一个小组，向朝鲜领导人金正恩提供建议。

BEIJING/SEOUL (REUTERS) - China has dispatched a team to North Korea including medical experts to advise on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, according to three people familiar with the situation.
Reuters was unable to immediately determine what the trip by the Chinese team signalled in terms of Mr Kim's health.
Mr Kim, believed to be 36, has disappeared from coverage in North Korean state media before.
In 2014, he vanished for more than a month and North Korean state TV later showed him walking with a limp.
Mr Kim is a third-generation hereditary leader who came to power after his father Kim Jong Il died in 2011 from a heart attack.

居住在宿舍的323,000名农民工中，约有3％（即9,929名）的测试呈阳性，这使他们成为这些宿舍的生活条件的焦点。
卫生部曾表示，由于进行了广泛的测试，它在宿舍中发现了更多案件。

SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Health (MOH) confirmed another 618 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday (April 25), taking the total count of coronavirus cases here to 12,693.

This is the lowest number of new community cases since March 29.
About 3 per cent, or 9,929, of the 323,000 migrant workers living in dormitories have tested positive, putting the spotlight on their living conditions in these dormitories.
The MOH had said that it picked up many more cases in dormitories because of extensive testing.

Despite the lost revenues, not all eligible businesses in Georgia jumped at the chance to reopen.
Asked about the 50,000 deaths and whether he felt any responsibility, Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday: "I think we've done a great job."
He pointed to early estimates that suggested the coronavirus could lead to at least 100,000 deaths in the United States.

"The system has automatically assigned you an order number… for G4804 on April 17, leaving Wuhan Station at 10.52am."
Strangely, after all the ticketing consternation, the triple document checks (passport, ticket, negative Covid test) at Wuhan Station the next morning seemed like a breeze.
