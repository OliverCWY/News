（CNN）多个消息人士告诉CNN，助手和盟友之间一直在共同努力，促使唐纳德·特朗普总统停止进行每日的冠状病毒简报。
特朗普在周四的通报会上问白宫冠状病毒特别工作组协调员德博拉·伯克斯博士。
一位白宫官员说，他们要求总统上周停止进行每日简报，但他拒绝了。
数十年来，白宫通讯员协会为情况介绍会分配了座位，而白宫也没有参与座位安排。
还有一些问题是由谁来决定社会隔离座位安排，以及白宫或白宫记者协会应决定座位安排。

(CNN) There has been a concerted effort among aides and allies to get President Donald Trump to stop conducting the daily coronavirus briefings, multiple sources tell CNN.
Trump asked White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx during Thursday's briefing.
One White House official said they asked the President to stop conducting the daily briefings last week but he resisted.
The White House Correspondents' Association makes seat assignments for the briefings, as it has for decades, and the White House does not have input into the seating arrangement.
There are also questions about who gets to decide the social distancing seating arrangement, and whether the White House or the White House Correspondents' Association should decide seating arrangements.

香港（CNN）美国空军16年来首次在关岛没有重型轰炸机。
一架美国空军的B-2轰炸机于2016年在关岛的安徒生空军基地起飞。
来自南达科他州埃尔斯沃思空军基地的美国空军B-1和来自日本三泽空军基地的美国F-16战斗机与日本空中自卫队F-2进行了日本北部沿海的双边联合训练2020年4月22日。
美国空军有两次同时将所有三种轰炸机带到安徒生空军基地，并随事件提供了生动的图片和视频。
直到上周，这种类型的显示一直持续到空军在安徒生空军基地进行“象形行走”时，这涉及到空军所说的“象形行走”，使基地的飞机范围排列整齐，包括B-52，KC-135加油机，空军和海军无人机在内的其中一条跑道。

Hong Kong (CNN) For the first time in 16 years, the United States Air Force has no heavy bombers on Guam.
A US Air Force B-2 bomber takes off at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, in 2016.
A US Air Force B-1 from Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota, and US F-16 fighters from Misawa Air Base, Japan, conduct a bilateral joint training with Japan Air Self-Defense Force F-2s off the coast of northern Japan on April 22, 2020.
Twice the US Air Force brought all three types of bombers to Andersen Air Force Base at the same time, providing imposing pictures and videos to go along with the events.
Those kinds of displays continued right up to last week, when the Air Force put on an "elephant walk" at Andersen Air Force Base This involved what the Air Force term an "elephant walk," lining up the range of aircraft at the base, including the B-52s, KC-135 tankers and Air Force and Navy drones, on one of its runways.

（CNN）—很明显，在冠状病毒感染后，飞行会有所不同，虽然一些航空公司正在讨论拆除中间座位以保持社会距离，但一家飞机内饰公司提出了适应经济舱的概念。
两面式座椅“ Janus”座椅由三排组成，中间的座椅朝向相反的方向。

“玻璃安全”的概念是一种防护罩，可以安装在现有座椅上，以“减少污染的可能性”。
尽管“ Janus”座椅需要对现有客舱进行大修，但“ Glassafe”可以将Aviointeriors第二次冠状病毒飞行建议安装在大多数标准飞机座椅上。

(CNN) — It's clear flying will be different after coronavirus, and while some airlines are discussing the removal of middle seats to maintain social distancing, one airplane interiors company has come up with concepts for adapting economy class cabins.
Two-faced seatsThe "Janus" seats are made up of a row of three, with the seat in the middle facing the opposite direction.
Courtesy AviointeriorsNamed after a god of Ancient Rome, the "Janus" seat has "two faces" and is made of "easy cleaning" and "safe hygienization materials."
The "Glassafe" concept is a protective shield that can be fitted on to existing seats "to reduce the probability of contamination."
Courtesy AviointeriorsWhile the "Janus" seat would require existing cabins to be overhauled, "Glassafe," Aviointeriors second coronavirus flying proposal can be fitted onto most standard airplane seats.

（CNN）西班牙政府严格的“待在家中”秩序，允许人们离开家园去养宠物。
好吧，这一命令促使一些人对政府在“宠物”方面的含义有所创新。
周五，西班牙国家警察在推特上发布了一张图片，其中一名男子因在西班牙北部小镇洛格罗尼奥的一条碗中“游走”一条鱼而被罚款。
由于冠状病毒大流行，他因违反政府命令停留在内部而受到处罚。
但是，他并不孤单。

(CNN) The Spanish government's strict stay-at-home order allows people to leave their homes to walk their pets.
Well, that order has prompted some to get a little creative with what the government means in terms of "pet."
On Friday the Spanish National Police tweeted an image of a man getting fined for "walking" a fish in a bowl in Logroño, a town in northern Spain.
He was penalized for violating government orders to stay inside due to the coronavirus pandemic.
However, he is not alone.

拜登在谈到唐纳德·特朗普总统时说：“用我的话说：我认为他将设法以某种方式取消大选，并提出无法举行大选的一些理由。”
您是否诚实地相信众议院议长南希·佩洛西（南加州）将与特朗普领导的努力一起推迟选举日？
当然，这一切都不会发生，因为特朗普可以推迟选举。
肯塔基大学法学院选举法专家乔什·道格拉斯（Josh Douglas）发推文说：“即使那样，他可能也没有权力推迟选举或推迟2021年1月20日任期。”
但是特朗普在真正的任何情况下都无法做的是推迟或取消选举。

"Mark my words: I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can't be held," Biden said of President Donald Trump.
Do you honestly believe that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-California) would go along with a Trump-led effort to postpone Election Day?
Of course, none of that is going to happen because Trump can's postpone the election.
"Even that would likely not give him power to postpone election or delay end of his term on Jan. 20, 2021," tweeted University of Kentucky Law School election law expert Josh Douglas.
But what Trump cannot do -- under, really, any circumstances -- is postpone or cancel the election.

东京（CNN）日本第三大城市的市长面临公众的强烈反对，此前他建议男性在冠状病毒大流行期间更适合在杂货店购物，因为女性花时间太长，导致超市里人满为患。
近几周来日本确诊的病毒病例数量激增-希望政府的最初病毒反应能够成功控制其传播。
大阪市长松井一郎（Ichiro Matsui）周四暗示，男性食品杂货店购物者可以减少在商店中的停留时间，从而减少这种病毒的潜在传播。
松井在周四于大阪举行的冠状病毒新闻发布会上对记者说：“妇女花较长时间在杂货店购物，因为他们浏览不同的产品，然后权衡哪种选择最佳。”
Matsui补充说：“男人会迅速抓住他们被告知要买的东西，这样他们就不会在超市流连忘返，这避免了与他人的亲密接触。”

Tokyo (CNN) The mayor of Japan's third-largest city is facing a public backlash after he suggested men are better suited to grocery shopping during the coronavirus pandemic, because women take too long and contribute to overcrowding at supermarkets.
The number of confirmed cases of the virus in Japan has spiked in recent weeks -- dashing hopes that the government's initial virus response had succeeded in controlling its spread.
On Thursday, Osaka mayor Ichiro Matsui implied male grocery shoppers would reduce the potential spread of the virus as they would spend less time in stores.
"Women take a longer time grocery shopping because they browse through different products and weigh out which option is best," Matsui told reporters at a coronavirus press conference in Osaka on Thursday.
"Men quickly grab what they're told to buy so they won't linger at the supermarket -- that avoids close contact with others," added Matsui.

（CNN）-尽管在Covid-19大流行中，全球数以百万计的人正在修剪自己的头发并发明新的食谱，但世界上成千上万的商用飞机也需要休息。
飞机被定期拖曳，以使它们的轮子可以旋转，并且维修人员清洁飞机的内部和外部。
费用通常取决于飞机的重量，可以理解，大型客机的存储成本更高。
也最好将飞机存放在温暖的地方，因为干燥的空气不太可能腐蚀飞机的金属零件。
当然，澳航目前并不是世界上唯一一家照顾陆上飞机的航空公司。

(CNN) — While millions of people around the world are cutting their own hair and inventing new recipes amid the Covid-19 pandemic, thousands of the world's commercial airplanes are also getting much-needed rest.
The planes are towed periodically around so that their wheels can rotate, and service members clean the inside and outside of the aircraft.
Fees are often determined by the weight of the plane, with huge passenger aircraft being understandably more expensive to store.
It's also preferable to store planes in warm areas, as dry air is less likely to corrode a plane's metal parts.
Qantas, of course, isn't the only airline in the world taking care of its grounded planes right now.

但是，它的使用寿命可以达到三到四个月，而医院中的呼吸机可以持续使用数年，并且可以帮助患有其他医疗问题的患者使用。
NASA的工程师将用于冠状病毒病患者的原型呼吸机运送到了纽约西奈山的伊坎医学院。
但是VITAL团队被迫提供帮助。

(CNN) The engineers at NASA have developed a high-pressure ventilator prototype specifically tailored to help coronavirus patients, according to the agency .
The team feels confident that the VITAL ventilator will be able to safely ventilate patients suffering from Covid-19 both here in the United States and throughout the world."
But it's built to last three or four months unlike ventilators in hospitals that were designed to last for years and help patients with other medical issues.
Engineers at NASA shipped the prototype ventilator for coronavirus disease patients to the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.
But the VITAL team was driven to help.

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
后来空袭被认为是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

但是，美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）采访了包括帕特里夏（Patricia）在内的五名十几岁和二十多岁的女性，他们声称格拉瑟（Glaser）在Bery's Place对其进行了性和情感虐待。
当女孩们反对时，他们说格拉泽会威胁要把他们赶出去。
一些幸存者说，格拉瑟（Glaser）介绍自己是一名医生，但支持起诉的律师告诉美国有线电视新闻网（CNN），他是物理治疗师-不是合格的医生。
Dilen于去年2月在Bery's Place进行的一次警察突袭中因警察的讯问而被捕，后来被释放。
但至少现在，他们说他们开始在贝里故居之外享受生活。

But five women in their late teens and early twenties interviewed by CNN, including Patricia, allege that Glaser sexually and emotionally abused them at Bery's Place.
When the girls objected, they say Glaser would threaten to cast them out on the streets.
Some survivors say Glaser introduced himself as a doctor, but lawyers supporting the prosecution told CNN that he is a physiotherapist -- not a qualified physician.
Dilen was arrested for questioning by police last February during a police raid at Bery's Place, and later released.
But for now, at least, they say they're beginning to enjoy their lives outside of Bery's Place.

## 香港冠状病毒检疫营内的情况

### What it's like inside a Hong Kong coronavirus quarantine camp

假日营地变成了隔离营地-隔离饮食-温度检查和穿PPE的工作人员在隔离区生活-感觉像是在学校，营地和监狱中混合在一起。
我的工厂位于鲤鱼门公园，通常是香港岛东部一个绿树成荫的度假村。
这个假日公园是香港用作冠状病毒检疫中心的几处设施之一。
在此之前，我已经在家工作了三个月-因此，在隔离营中做同样的事情并没有多大区别。
但这证明了香港政府对遏制从海外进口的案件并推回本地自满情绪的重视程度。

Holiday camp turned quarantine campLife in quarantine -- with its regimented meals, temperature checks and PPE-wearing staff -- feels like an odd mix of being in school, at camp, and in prison.
My facility, in Lei Yue Mun Park, is normally a leafy holiday village in the east of Hong Kong Island.
This holiday park is one of several facilities being used as coronavirus quarantine centers in Hong KongSince March, that number has surged.
Prior to now, I'd already been working from home for three months -- so doing the same from a quarantine camp hasn't made much of a difference.
But it's a testament to how serious the Hong Kong government is about clamping down on cases imported from overseas, and pushing back on local complacency.
