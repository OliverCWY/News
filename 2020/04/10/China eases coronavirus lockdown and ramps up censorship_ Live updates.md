Health experts have said from the beginning that only the virus sets the timetable for when the mass pause is over.

US President Donald Trump wants to hit fast-forward. He has specifically expressed interest in a "big bang" reopening, where the entire country comes back online at once, perhaps as soon as May 1.

Trump's (lack of) authority: Just as it wasn't clear that Trump had the power to shut the country down, it's not clear he has the power to open it back up -- particularly not when it's local officials and individual businesses and institutions that would bear the risk of relaxing too soon.

Remember: The federal government's guidelines on closing businesses and restricting gatherings were only ever recommendations. Decisions on how and when to reopen the country will lie mostly with governors who enacted mandatory stay-at-home orders.

Public opinion matters: Regardless of any decisions from the White House, Americans will need to feel comfortable returning into public for the economy to actually "reopen."

A CNN/SSRS poll released Wednesday showed 60% of Americans say they would feel uncomfortable returning to their regular routines if social distancing guidelines were lifted after April 30, the current expiration date for Trump's recommendations.
