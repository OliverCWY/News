伦敦（彭博社）-意大利和西班牙正准备在封锁下再待几周，因为冠状病毒的波动感染率阻止了欧洲政府放松对公共生活的限制。
在欧洲其他地方的呼声中，她呼吁德国人在漫长的复活节周末遵守这些措施。
总理鲍里斯·约翰逊（Boris Johnson）从重症监护获释后，英国的政治不确定性有所缓解，尽管他仍在住院以从冠状病毒感染中康复。
意大利报告死亡人数和感染人数上升，而法国的死亡人数增加，这是由于养老院的积压数据所致。
党的领导人帕布罗·卡萨多说，人民党是出于对国家的责任感而支持这一扩展，而不是因为桑切斯拥有任何“道德权威”。

LONDON (BLOOMBERG) - Italy and Spain are preparing for several more weeks under lockdown as volatile coronavirus infection rates prevent Europe's governments from easing curbs on public life.
In a plea echoed elsewhere in Europe, she called on Germans to abide by the measures over the long Easter weekend.
Political uncertainty in Britain eased after Prime Minister Boris Johnson was released from intensive care, though he remained hospitalised to recover from a coronavirus infection.
Italy reported a rise in deaths and infections, while France's death toll increased with a backlog of data from nursing homes.
The People's Party backed the extension out of a sense of duty to the country, not because Sanchez has any "moral authority," party leader Pablo Casado said.

VATICAN CITY (AFP) - Church doors will be shut and the Vatican sealed off when Pope Francis leads 1.3 billion Catholics in Easter Sunday celebrations held under a worldwide coronavirus lockdown.
Even such hallowed traditions as the pope's messages to the faithful on Saint Peter's Square are being replaced by livestreamed prayers that Pope Francis reluctantly records from the seclusion of his private library.
"We have to respond to our confinement with all our creativity," Pope Francis said in an interview published by several Catholic newspapers this week.
"They are the saints next door, the priests who gave their lives by serving," Pope Francis said.
Pope Francis told the Catholic newspapers that people across the world can try to spiritually escape their confinement through introspection.

For instance, not all Zoom meetings require a password to join in.
