相反，其他参与者不知道他们还必须进行多少次试验或阻止。

一线希望尽管2020年桑德斯的努力（如他在2016年的第一次竞选）以失败告终，但引人入胜的，柔和的结论不应掩盖这次桑德斯竞选活动取得很大成功的事实。
在2020年的竞选活动中，桑德斯带来了惊人的1.81亿美元捐款，其中一半以上的捐款不到200美元。
即使桑德斯在很大程度上落败给拜登的州，桑德斯仍然吸引了30岁以下的大多数选民。
政治评论员兼作家诺姆·乔姆斯基（Noam Chomsky）在桑德斯（Sanders）暂停竞选活动的那天接受采访时说：“现在经常说桑德斯（Sanders）竞选失败了。”
Buzzfeed上一篇有关桑德斯（Sanders）竞选活动的文章讲述了在认可消息传出后，一位高级职员如何“明显地发抖”。

Silver liningsAlthough the 2020 Sanders effort, like his first run in 2016, ended in defeat, the drawn-out, subdued conclusion shouldn't overshadow the fact that a lot went right with the Sanders campaign this time around.
For the 2020 campaign, Sanders brought in an astounding $181m in donations, more than half of which came in contributions smaller than $200.
Even when he lost states by large margins to Biden, Sanders carried a majority of voters under 30.
"It's common to say now that the Sanders campaign failed," political commentator and author Noam Chomsky said in an interview with Democracy Now radio programme on the day Sanders suspended his campaign.
A Buzzfeed article about the Sanders campaign recounts how one senior staffer was "visibly shaking with nerves" after news of the endorsements came out.

石油输出国组织及其盟国已同意将产量削减五分之一以上，以应对因冠状病毒封锁而造成的需求下降。
该组织表示，将在5月和6月削减产量1000万桶，以帮助提振价格。
这与在冠状病毒大流行期间对石油的需求下降一起，有助于将油价推高至3月底的18年低点。
尽管美国确实表示，由于油价暴跌，美国的石油产量正在逐渐减少，但美国并未做出任何削减的承诺。
唐纳德·特朗普总统曾警告沙特阿拉伯，如果美国不削减石油产量，美国将实施制裁。

The group said it would cut output in May and June by 10 million barrels to help prop up prices.
That, together with the collapse in demand for oil amid the coronavirus pandemic, help to push oil prices to 18-year lows by the end of March.
The US has not committed itself to any cuts although it did say that its oil output was gradually reducing anyway due to plunging oil prices.
President Donald Trump had warned Saudi Arabia that the US would impose sanctions if it did not cut oil production.

这是服装工厂所有者，印度Ambattur时尚印度公司董事长Vijay Mahtaney对这种流行病如何影响服装行业的鲜明评估。
通常，Vijay Mahtaney及其合作伙伴Amit Mahtaney和Shawn Islam在三个国家（孟加拉国，印度和约旦）共雇用18,000名工人。
孟加拉国有超过四百万的服装工人，而纺织和服装产品占该国去年出口的90％以上。
陆副教授认为，冠状病毒大流行可能使孟加拉国，越南，柬埔寨和印度等国家裁掉服装部门4％至9％的工作。
Sparrow Apparel Bangladesh董事总经理Shawn Islam表示：“它提供了慷慨的刺激方案，以补贴工资，将贷款转换为长期债务并提供非常合理的利率。”

This is the stark assessment of how the pandemic is impacting the clothing industry from garment factory owner, Vijay Mahtaney, the chairman of Ambattur Fashion India.
In normal times, Vijay Mahtaney and his partners Amit Mahtaney and Shawn Islam employ a total of 18,000 workers in three countries - Bangladesh, India and Jordan.
Bangladesh has more than four million garment workers, and textile and apparel products made up more than 90% of the country's exports last year.
Associate Professor Lu thinks the coronavirus pandemic could see countries such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, Cambodia and India cutting between 4% to 9% of garment sector jobs.
"It has offered a generous stimulus package to subsidise wages, convert loans to long-term debt and offer very reasonable interest rates," said Shawn Islam, managing director of Sparrow Apparel Bangladesh.

前国际货币基金组织首席经济学家说，与亚洲相比，西方国家“轻视了冠状病毒”。
拉古拉姆·拉詹（Raghuram Rajan）表示，西方经济体今年的经济增速将下降6％。
芝加哥大学布斯商学院（University of Chicago Booth School of Business）的金融学教授是经济学家，他对西方经济做出了黯淡的预测，因为他希望西方经济将从扩张转向收缩。
“在这一点上，我们可能正在考虑西方国家的GDP增长从约2个百分点转变为3个百分点，再下降为4个或5个百分点。
为了度过危机，拉詹先生希望看到经济体共同努力，共享资源，而不是贸易保护主义。

Raghuram Rajan said western economies are facing a drop in economic growth by as much as 6% this year.
The economist, who is a finance professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, gave a bleak forecast for western economies as he expects them to shift from expansion to contraction.
"At this point, we're probably thinking of western countries seeing a shift in GDP growth from about 2 percentage to 3 percentage points, to negative 4 or 5 percentage points.
To get through the crisis, Mr Rajan wants to see economies working together to share resources rather than being protectionist.

在知识社会之前，杰克（Jack）是四个兄弟姐妹之一，也是唯一一个参加TKS的人。他对神经科学感兴趣，并讨论了自己是一名脑外科医师。
“当我们教给孩子有关人工智能的知识时，我们会教给他们一种技术语言，并将他们带入概率论和统计学领域。
希望孩子们进一步了解技术的父母还有其他选择。
知识社会当然是昂贵的，许多聪明的学生可能会在不花所有钱的情况下表现出色。

Tim and Kelley McDonald enrolled their son Jack in The Knowledge Society (TKS), a part-time school for teenagers, to give him a chance to learn what he doesn't at traditional school.
Before The Knowledge Society, Jack, who's one of four siblings and the only one enrolled in TKS, was interested in neuroscience and discussed being a brain surgeon.
"When we teach our kids about AI, we teach them a technical language and take them deeper into probability and statistics.
There are other options for parents who want their children to learn more about technology.
The Knowledge Society is certainly expensive, and many bright students could expect to excel without shelling out all that money.

随着系列第三季的回归，它似乎比以往任何时候都更具替代性，因此受到更多欢迎。
Villanelle操纵Eve做出了以前无法想象的事情：她砍了斧头，杀害了威胁Villanelle生命的人。
当Villanelle后来告诉夏娃“你是我的人”时，在罗马废墟­的异国情调中宣告了具有多重含义的一行-夏娃拒绝了她。
除其他原因外：她的丈夫尼科（Owen McDonnell）因上个赛季维拉内尔（Villanelle）袭击他而患上PTSD。
★★★★★《杀戮前夕》将于4月12日在美国的BBC America和AMC以及4月13日在英国的BBC iPlayer上首播。

As the series’ third season returns, it seems more of an alternative universe than ever, and more welcome for that.
Villanelle manipulated Eve into doing something previously unthinkable: she took an axe and murdered a man threatening Villanelle’s life.
When Villanelle later told Eve “You’re mine” – a line with multiple meanings, declared in the exotic setting of a Roman ruin ­– Eve rejected her.
Among other reasons: her husband, Niko (Owen McDonnell), is in hospital suffering from PTSD because Villanelle attacked him last season.
★★★★★Killing Eve premieres on 12 April on BBC America and AMC in the US and on BBC iPlayer on 13 April in the UK.

在1945年至1989年之间，波兰各地的城镇和村庄建立了3,000座教堂。
这些教堂既没有法律禁止，也没有被禁止，这些教堂-其中许多看起来像是从外太空到达的，令人大跌眼镜-对于建筑师来说是天赐之物。
“建立一个建筑实践是不可能的，”《天七建筑》（Day-VII Architecture）一书的合著者伊扎贝拉·西乔斯卡（IzabelaCichońska）解释说，这些书对这些教堂进行了分类。
他设计了三座教堂，包括波兰女王格洛夫（Glogów）的圣母玛利亚教堂。
尽管这些教堂中最好的教堂在视觉上大饱眼福，但它们的建筑也许比其设计更为独特。

In towns and villages across Poland, 3,000 churches were built between 1945 and 1989.
Neither legal nor prohibited, these churches – many of them eye-popping edifices that look as if they’ve arrived from outer space – were a godsend for architects.
“It was impossible to set up an architectural practice,” explains Izabela Cichońska, co-author of the book Day-VII Architecture, that catalogues these churches.
He designed three churches including Glogów’s Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Queen of Poland.
Despite the visual feast that the best of these churches represents, their construction is perhaps even more extraordinary than their design.

世界各地的其他珊瑚通常不具有相同的生物生存能力。
按照这个速度，到2100年，红海礁石可能是最后的礁石之一。
当Fine和研究小组将硝酸盐，铵盐和磷酸盐等营养物质引入实验时，珊瑚的生理机能受到损害，它们不再具有弹性。
芬说：“仅靠温度是不够的。”
“如果我们要确保亚喀巴湾和北部红海成为珊瑚礁的避难所，我们就必须消除当地的压力。”与Fine，Meibom和其他几位科学家和外交官一道，Kleinhaus呼吁联合国教科文组织宣布红海礁作为海洋世界遗产，以帮助确保该礁得以持久存在，并受到保护，免受当地威胁，否则可能会损害珊瑚的复原力。

Other corals around the world don’t typically possess the same biological ability to persist.
At this rate, the Red Sea reefs could be one of the last standing by the year 2100.
When Fine and the team introduce nutrients such as nitrate, ammonium and phosphate into the experiments, the corals’ physiology is compromised and they’re no longer as resilient.
“It’s not enough to be resilient to temperature,” Fine says.
“If we are to secure the Gulf of Aqaba and the northern Red Sea as a coral reef refuge, we have to remove the local stress.”Along with Fine, Meibom, and several other scientists and diplomats, Kleinhaus is calling on Unesco to declare the Red Sea reef as a Marine World Heritage Site, to help ensure that the reef persists and will be protected from local threats that could otherwise compromise the coral’s resilience.

因此，将其更多地视为将您的ard积物整理成整齐的堆放，以便以后回收的机会。

If you need a little extra motivation for the spring clean, though, there’s probably treasure hidden in there.
Locked inside the old products we hoard in dusty corners are valuable metals and minerals.
Collectively, our homes and backyards are an “urban mine” filled with these essential materials that are just waiting to be dug out.
Each of these contains copper, silver and even gold, along with a wide range of valuable rare earth elements.
So, view this more as an opportunity to sort your hoard into neat piles, for recycling later.

您可能已经注意到您的一些同事是如何担任领导角色的，如水落石出。
对于其他人而言，情况无异于：在周围的人处处处感到尴尬，and琐的自我怀疑掩盖了每个决定。
如果您属于后一组，您可能会想知道为什么要成为领导者会让您感到恐惧，以及为什么觉得自己很难成为经理。
如果您的父母使紫罗兰萎缩，那么您也同样会增加几率。
关键是父母对您的举止。

You’ve probably noticed how some of your colleagues take to leadership roles like a duck to water.
It couldn’t be more different for others: bossing around people feels awkward, and a nagging self-doubt shadows every decision.
If you’re in the latter group, you might wonder why the thought of being a leader fills you with dread, and why you find it so hard to even see yourself as a manager.
If your parents were shrinking violets, the odds are increased that you will be too.
And key here is the way your parents behaved toward you.

在青铜时代和铁器时代，整个欧洲，地中海和北非的人们都在交易距今达5,000年前的鸵鸟蛋。
霍多斯博士的团队热衷于寻找鸵鸟蛋的来源，以及这些鸵鸟是野生的还是养殖的。
研究人员使用来自埃及，以色列，约旦和土耳其的现代鸵鸟蛋，比较了古代和现代鸡蛋中的同位素以追踪其起源。
研究结果表明，鸵鸟卵可能在埃及北部和黎凡特（包括约旦，叙利亚和土耳其）的尼罗河三角洲进行了远距离交易。

People across Europe, the Mediterranean and North Africa traded ostrich eggs up to 5,000 years ago, in the Bronze and Iron Ages.
Dr Hodos's team were keen to find out where the ostrich eggs came from, and whether the ostriches were wild or farmed.
Using modern ostrich eggs from Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Turkey, the researchers compared isotopes in ancient and modern eggs to trace their origins.
