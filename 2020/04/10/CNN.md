健康专家从一开始就说过，只有病毒才可以设定大规模停顿结束的时间表。
他特别表示了对“大爆炸”重新开放的兴趣，整个国家可能会在5月1日立即恢复在线。
切记：联邦政府关于关闭业务和限制聚会的准则只是建议。
关于如何以及何时重新开放该国的决定，主要取决于颁布强制性的在家中令的州长。
舆论问题：不管白宫有何决定，美国人都需要为重返公众市场而感到舒适，以使经济真正“重新开放”。

Health experts have said from the beginning that only the virus sets the timetable for when the mass pause is over.
He has specifically expressed interest in a "big bang" reopening, where the entire country comes back online at once, perhaps as soon as May 1.
Remember: The federal government's guidelines on closing businesses and restricting gatherings were only ever recommendations.
Decisions on how and when to reopen the country will lie mostly with governors who enacted mandatory stay-at-home orders.
Public opinion matters: Regardless of any decisions from the White House, Americans will need to feel comfortable returning into public for the economy to actually "reopen."

（CNN）据海军官员说，一名来自美国海军西奥多·罗斯福（Theodore Roosevelt）的水手，他的冠状病毒检测呈阳性，被发现无反应后，于周四被送往关岛的重症监护室。
冠状病毒大流行对泰迪·罗斯福水手的影响是争议的中心，这场争议导致代理海军部长托马斯·莫迪星期二辞职。
海军在周四的一份声明中说，该名水手于3月30日检测出冠状病毒阳性，周四被发现昏迷，他已被关岛美国海军医院的重症监护病房收治。
但有3,170例呈阴性，416例呈阳性，其中187例有症状，229例无症状。
“我认为认为泰迪·罗斯福是一个独一无二的问题不是一个好主意。

(CNN) A sailor from the USS Theodore Roosevelt who had tested positive for coronavirus was admitted to an intensive care unit in Guam Thursday after being found unresponsive, according to a Navy official.
The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Teddy Roosevelt sailors was at the center of a controversy that led to the Tuesday resignation of Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly.
The sailor tested positive for coronavirus on March 30 and was found unconscious Thursday, he has been admitted to the intensive care unit of the US Navy Hospital on Guam, the Navy said in a statement Thursday.
But 3,170 tested negative, 416 tested positive, 187 of those were symptomatic, 229 were asymptomatic.
"I think it's not a good idea to think the Teddy Roosevelt is a one-of-a-kind issue.

英国航空公司飞行员协会（BALPA）的布莱恩·斯特鲁顿（Brian Strutton）表示：“飞行员需要经常接受培训，并且要具备'近距'才能飞行。
飞行员需要使用真实的，全面的飞行模拟器。
法国航空的飞行员坐在戴高乐机场附近公司培训中心的空中客车A350飞行模拟器中。
除了提高程序技巧的实用性之外，飞行员还需要保持头脑健康。
机组人员习惯了相当有条理的工作方式，并且习惯于根据航班时刻表了解下个月的情况。

"Pilots require frequent training and 'recency' to be able to fly," says Brian Strutton of the British Airline Pilots Association, or BALPA, which represents the interests of all UK pilots.
Pilots need to access real, full-scale flight simulators.
Air France pilots sit inside an Airbus A350 flight simulator at the company training centre near Roissy Charles de Gaulle airport.
Beyond the practicalities of brushing up procedural skills, pilots need to keep their minds in good shape too.
Flight crew are used to quite a structured way of working and are conditioned to knowing what is coming up in the next month in terms of their flight schedules.

每年，中国各地都有数百万高中生和职业培训生参加高考，俗称“高考”或大考。
在完成安徽省合肥市2013年大学入学考试的第一门科目后，学生们从校园走出来。
高中学生晚上学习，为中国东部江苏省连云港市的一所中学准备2016年的高考。
学生的考试成绩是进入中国大学的唯一标准，而美国的SAT考试则是学生可以多次参加考试的唯一标准。
其他学生认为，在过去三个月中，他们的成长比一生中的更长。

Every year, millions of high school students and vocational trainees across China sit the college entrance exam , known colloquially as the " gaokao ," or big exam.
Students walk out from a schoolyard after finishing the first subject of the 2013 university entrance exam in Hefei, north China's Anhui province.
Senior high school students studying at night to prepare for the 2016 gaokao at a high school in Lianyungang, east China's Jiangsu province.
Students' results on the test are the sole criteria for admission to university in China, unlike the SAT in the US, where students can take the exam several times.
Other students felt they had grown up more in the past three months than in the rest of their lives.

## 史前猴子漂流穿越大西洋到南美

（CNN）根据一项在秘鲁发现的化石牙齿的研究，一群现已灭绝的猴子在大约3500万年前从非洲的天然木筏上进行了一次危险的跨大西洋旅行，定居南美。
人们相信，史前的Ucayalipithecus猴子在漂浮在海岸线上的植被浮岛上穿越了900英里的大西洋（当时是狭窄的海洋），可能是在热带风暴期间。
该研究于周四发表在《科学》杂志上。
塞弗特说：“这大概就是为什么我们在化石记录中知道的大多数水上扩散事件都涉及非常小的动物的原因。”
人们认为，只有另外两种“移民”哺乳动物在大西洋沿岸进行了艰难的穿越，尽管它们的确切抵达方式长期以来一直是热烈讨论的话题。

(CNN) A crew of now-extinct monkeys made a treacherous transatlantic journey on a natural raft from Africa to settle in South America around 35 million years ago, according to a study of fossilized teeth found in Peru.
It's believed the prehistoric Ucayalipithecus monkeys made the more than 900-mile trip across the Atlantic (a narrower ocean at the time) on floating islands of vegetation that broke off from coastlines, possibly during a tropical storm.
The study published Thursday in the journal Science.
"This is presumably why most of these overwater dispersal events that we know of in the fossil record involve very small animals," Seiffert said.
Only two other species of "immigrant" mammals are thought to have made what would have been a harsh crossing across the Atlantic, although exactly how they got there has long been a topic of heated discussion.

纽约（CNN商业）副总裁迈克·彭斯（Mike Pence）的办公室在拒绝允许美国最高卫生官员出现在美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）并讨论冠状病毒大流行的几天后，于星期四下午改变了方向，试图向该网络施加压力以试图携带该病毒。白宫的冗长的每日简报会全面。
这个故事发表后，便士的办公室允许为美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）周四晚上的冠状病毒市政厅预订疾病控制和预防中心主任罗伯特·雷德菲尔德（Robert Redfield）博士。
CNN通常只播放唐纳德·特朗普总统的问答环节，有时包括直播的医疗保健官员。
特朗普离开主席台后，美国有线电视新闻网经常取消白宫简报，以讨论和核实总统所说的话。
美国有线电视新闻网的一位高管说，由于包括Pence在内的完整简报的篇幅很长，网络通常会返回到这样的节目中，这可能要花费两个多小时。

New York (CNN Business) Vice President Mike Pence's office reversed course on Thursday afternoon, after declining for days to allow the nation's top health officials to appear on CNN and discuss the coronavirus pandemic, in what was an attempt to pressure the network into carrying the White House's lengthy daily briefings in full.
After this story was published, Pence's office allowed for the booking of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield for CNN's Thursday night coronavirus town hall.
CNN often only broadcasts President Donald Trump's question and answer session, which sometimes includes the health care officials, live on-air.
After Trump leaves the podium, CNN frequently cuts out of the White House briefing to discuss and fact-check what the President has said.
A CNN executive said that the network usually returns to such programming because of the extensive length of the full briefing that includes Pence, which can run in excess of two hours.

New York (CNN Business) In late March, Instacart worker Annaliisa Arambula accepted a grocery order that came with a big tip: $55.
I couldn't believe it," Arambula told CNN Business.
Some people are dealing with that by offering big tips, as high as $50 or more, to entice Instacart workers to pick up their orders.
Some workers told CNN Business tips can make up half of their income or more.
Detached customersIn addition to having their tips slashed at the last minute, some Instacart workers are also the target of seemingly tone-deaf remarks from customers.

这位艺术家一生都住在斯普林菲尔德，并称她在奥扎克斯（Ozarks）地区的故乡为“美国通用城镇”。
布莱克蒙即将在Fotografiska举行的节目“发烧的梦”以虚构和现实为题材。
布莱克蒙通常会从细节入手-例如穿着相配连衣裙的女孩-然后从那里弄清楚场景。
布莱克蒙（Blackmon）的主题具有普遍性-想要掌控自己的生活，并且不可能做到这一点。

Adults, when they do appear, are often cropped out of frame, obscured like the unintelligible grownups of Charlie Brown's world.
The artist has lived in Springfield her entire life, calling her home city in the Ozarks region the "generic American town."
Blackmon's forthcoming show at Fotografiska, "Fever Dreams," plays on fiction and reality.
Blackmon will often start with details -- like the girls in their matching dresses -- and then work out the scene from there.
Blackmon's themes are universal -- the desire to manage one's life, and the impossibility to do so.

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
后来空袭被认为是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

Mjøstårnet的高度达到280英尺，于去年开放后成为世界上最高的木材建筑。
长期倡导和设计木制建筑的建筑师Michael Green表示，“现在有很多东西在融合。”
Or Framework是位于俄勒冈州波特兰的一座雄心勃勃的148英尺高的木塔，在去年因成本担忧而被取消之前，该塔被设定为美国最高的木塔。
考虑到在2018年之前，俄勒冈州成为美国第一个允许使用18层木制建筑的州，而在美国，没有任何地方允许任何超过6层的建筑物，这一决定意义重大。
该组织表示，除了担心森林砍伐外，洒水喷头不能有效防止烈焰扩散到木结构建筑中。

Reaching 280 feet in height, Mjøstårnet became the world's tallest timber building upon opening last year.
According to architect Michael Green, a longstanding advocate for -- and designer of -- wooden buildings, there are "a whole bunch of things converging right now."
Or Framework, an ambitious 148-foot-tall timber tower in Portland, Oregon, that was set to be the USA's tallest wooden tower before was canceled amid cost concerns last year.
The decision is significant given that, before 2018, when Oregon became the first US state to allow 18-story wooden buildings, nowhere in America permitted anything higher than six.
In addition to concerns about deforestation, the group says sprinklers are ineffective at preventing blazes from spreading through wood buildings.
