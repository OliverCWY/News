It seems that potato-based humour is working unexpected wonders in getting us through the day (see our earlier post about a boss conducting a meeting as a potato here).

When comedian Matt Lucas updated a 20-year-old comedy song with lyrics to give advice about avoiding coronavirus, he expected about 500 people to watch it.

But the video for his revised Baked Potato Song (above) has now had three million views, and he is about to release it to raise funds for his FeedNHS campaign.

In its new incarnation, his baked potato character instructs people to wash their hands, stay indoors and not touch their faces.
