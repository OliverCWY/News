在额外支出中，政府将拨出75万亿卢比用于医疗保健支出，110万亿卢比用于社会保护，70.1万亿卢比用于企业的税收优惠和信贷。
“我们将发布《 Perppu》，以预测可能出现的州预算赤字达到5.07％的可能性。”
将国家预算赤字限制从目前法律规定的占GDP的3％放宽，将适用三年，直至2022年。
印度尼西亚的2020年国家预算最初计划使国家支出达到2.54万亿美元，预算赤字占国内生产总值的1.76％，相当于307.2万亿印尼盾。
印尼经济改革中心（研究中心主任）阿卜杜拉（Piter Abdullah）将增加支出和增加国家预算赤字的决定描述为“值得赞赏的勇敢步骤”。

Of the extra spending, the government will allocate 75 trillion rupiah for healthcare spending, 110 trillion rupiah for social protection and 70.1 trillion rupiah for tax incentives and credit for enterprises.
"We will issue the Perppu to anticipate the possibility of a state budget deficit that is estimated to reach 5.07 per cent."
The relaxation of the state budget deficit limit from the current legal limit of 3 per cent of GDP will apply for three years until 2022.
Indonesia's 2020 state budget originally planned for 2.54 quadrillion in state expenditure with a budget deficit of 1.76 per cent of GDP, equal to 307.2 trillion rupiah.
Centre of Reform on Economics (Core) Indonesia research director Piter Abdullah described the decision to increase spending and the state budget deficit limit as a "brave step that should be appreciated".

联合国（AFP）-联合国秘书长安东尼奥·古特雷斯（Antonio Guterres）周三（3月31日）表示，冠状病毒大流行是自第二次世界大战以来最严重的全球性危机，对可能引发全球冲突表示担忧。
总部位于纽约的联合国成立于1945年战争结束，拥有193个会员国。
古特雷斯补充说：“只有大家团结在一起，如果我们忘记了政治游戏，并且了解到危及人类的生命，才能团结一致地采取更强有力和更有效的应对措施。”

The New York-based United Nations was founded at the end of the war in 1945 and has 193 member states.
"A stronger and more effective response... is only possible in solidarity if everybody comes together and if we forget political games and understand that it is humankind that is at stake," Mr Guterres added.

悉尼（彭博社）-在冠状病毒大流行导致大多数通常携带新鲜食材的商业航班被取消后，澳大利亚政府将帮助包租数百架装有龙虾，牛肉和奶制品等产品的飞机飞往包括中国，日本和新加坡在内的主要市场生产。
政府在一份声明中说，政府将提供1.1亿澳元（9,600万新元），以将澳大利亚产品推向主要市场，首先是阿拉伯联合酋长国，中国，日本，香港和新加坡。
包括澳航和维珍澳大利亚航空在内的航空公司最近的国际航班停飞使得不可能将包括冷藏海鲜，红肉，乳制品以及一些水果和蔬菜在内的产品运往离岸市场。
随着餐馆关闭数月后重新营业，对中国和其他一些主要亚洲市场的澳大利亚产品的需求开始回升，这也为市场提供了支持。
塔斯马尼亚海鲜产业委员会首席执行官朱利安·哈灵顿（Julian Harrington）表示，中国对龙虾和鲍鱼的需求有所改善。

SYDNEY (BLOOMBERG) - Australia's government will help charter hundreds of planes full of products such as rock lobster, beef and dairy to key markets including China, Japan and Singapore, after the coronavirus pandemic led to the cancellation of most commercial flights that usually carry fresh produce.
The government will provide A$110 million (S$96 million) to get Australian products to key markets, starting with the United Arab Emirates, China, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore, the government said in a statement.
Recent international flight groundings by airlines including Qantas Airways and Virgin Australia Holdings have made it impossible to get products including chilled seafood, red meat, dairy products and some fruit and vegetables to offshore markets.
The support comes as demand for Australian produce in China and some other key Asian markets has started to recover as restaurants reopen after months of shutdowns.
Mr Julian Harrington, chief executive of the Tasmanian Seafood Industry Council, also said there had been some improvement in demand for rock lobster and abalone in China.

LONDON (REUTERS) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's photographer has coronavirus symptoms and is self-isolating, the Sun newspaper reported on Tuesday (March 31), days after he visited a temporary field hospital set up to treat patients infected with the virus.

Parsons photographed Johnson outside his Downing Street office during a moment of appreciation for health workers on March 26.

The leaders acknowledged that the proposed multi-stakeholder alliance will not be easy to set up or manage.
"Our decisions over the course of the coming weeks and months will determine what the world will look like tomorrow."

They have a system to identify cases quickly, and they have very good communication to make the Singapore people participate in this fight," he said.

监管机构与新加坡银行协会，人寿保险协会，一般保险协会和新加坡金融机构协会合作，采取了一系列措施。
帮助个人的措施包括允许他们将本金或本金和利息都推迟到12月31日之前。
金融管理局表示，利息将仅在递延本金上产生，而不会在递延利息支付中收取任何利息。
人寿和健康保险单的客户可以向其保险公司申请将保费支付最多延期六个月，同时保持保险范围。
诸如财产和车辆的一般保险保单持有人可以在保持保护的同时向其保险公司申请分期付款计划。

The regulator worked with the Association of Banks in Singapore, the Life Insurance Association, the General Insurance Association and the Finance Houses Association of Singapore for the slew of measures.
Measures to help individuals include allowing them to defer either principal payment or both principal and interest payments on their residential property loans until Dec 31.
Interest will accrue only on the deferred principal amount, and no interest will be charged on the deferred interest payments, the MAS said.
Customers of life and health insurance policies can apply to their insurer to defer premium payments for up to six months while maintaining insurance coverage.
General insurance policyholders, such as for property and vehicles, may apply to their insurers for instalment payment plans while maintaining protection.
