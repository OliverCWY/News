(CNN) She's all grown up now, but Hailie Jade Mathers is still her daddy's girl.

Eminem shared that his daughter graduated with a 3.9 GPA from Michigan State University and is doing well.

"She's doing good," he said. "She's made me proud for sure."

The younger Mathers and her mother, Eminem's ex-wife Kimberly Anne Scott, are well known to Eminem's fans because of his song lyrics.
