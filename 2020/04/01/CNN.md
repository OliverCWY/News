禁区刚过去一周，卫生纸和面食就神奇地回来了。
伦敦被告知，它在冠状病毒感染方面比英国其他地区领先大约三周。
在标志和掌声中，已向国家卫生局工作人员提供支持，以应对冠状病毒爆发。
军人抵达后将伦敦的ExCel中心变成了NHS夜莺医院。
在伦敦，当我们进入黑暗的两周时，唯一的安慰就是它的近在咫尺可能会将尽头带入视野。

Just over a week into the lockdown, and the toilet paper and pasta have magically returned.
London was told it was ahead of the rest of the UK for coronavirus infections by about three weeks.
Support for National Health Service staff fighting the coronavirus outbreak has been displayed in signs and applause.
Members of the military arrive to turn the ExCel Centre in London into the NHS Nightingale Hospital.
In London, the only comfort as we enter the dark fortnight ahead, is that its close may bring the end into view.

华盛顿（CNN）美国海军航空母舰西奥多·罗斯福（Theodore Roosevelt）的司令官警告说，必须采取果断行动来挽救船员的生命，在该舰上，冠状病毒的爆发已扩散到至少70名水手。
将大部分人员从已部署的美国核航空母舰上撤离并将他们隔离两个星期似乎是一项非同寻常的措施，”他在备忘录中写道。
美国太平洋舰队司令官拒绝透露核动力航母上有多少名水手测试冠状病毒呈阳性反应，但表示没有人住院。
另一位海军官员说，截至周二上午，航空母舰上的冠状病毒病例已超过70例，并补充说，海军预计这一数字将会增加。
周一，一名美国国防官员告诉美国有线电视新闻网，第二艘美国航母罗纳德·里根号也面临“少数”积极案件。

Washington (CNN) The commander of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, a US Navy aircraft carrier where an outbreak of the coronavirus has spread to at least 70 sailors, has warned Navy leadership that decisive action is required to save the lives of the ship's crew.
Removing the majority of personnel from a deployed US nuclear aircraft carrier and isolating them for two weeks may seem like an extraordinary measure," he wrote in the memo.
The commander of US Pacific Fleet declined to say how many sailors aboard the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier had tested positive for the coronavirus, but said that no one had been hospitalized.
A second Navy official said that the number of coronavirus cases on board the aircraft carrier had surpassed 70 as of Tuesday morning, added that the Navy expected that figure to increase.
On Monday, a US defense official told CNN that a second US aircraft carrier, the USS Ronald Reagan, is also facing a "handful" of positive cases.

（CNN）这是“环游世界”的辩论：在冠状病毒大流行期间您是否应该戴口罩？
Fauci警告说：“您不希望将面具带离那些真正存在感染风险的医疗保健提供者。
那些被用来防止与患有该病的患者很近的医护人员感染这种疾病。”
同时，在大流行开始的中国，中国疾病预防控制中心建议“外出时戴口罩”。
“世界卫生组织和疾病预防控制中心在过去几天中重申，他们不建议公众佩戴口罩。

(CNN) It's the debate heard 'round the world: Should you or shouldn't you wear a face mask during the coronavirus pandemic?
Fauci warned, "You don't want to take masks away from the health care providers who are in a real and present danger of getting infected.
Those are used to prevent getting the disease from health care workers that are in close proximity to patients with it," Phillips said.
Meanwhile, in China, where the pandemic began, the Chinese CDC has recommended to "wear a mask when going out."
"What the World Health Organization and the CDC have reaffirmed in the last few days is that they do not recommend the general public wear masks.

大卫·凯斯勒（David Kessler）与传奇的丧亲专家伊丽莎白·库伯勒·罗斯（ElisabethKübler-Ross）合着了《悲伤与悲伤》一书，他说：“死亡的仪式对于健康的悲伤是如此重要。”
惠勒（Wheeler）建议每天与尽可能多的家庭成员一起办理登机手续，也许是在Zoom等团体平台上。
虽然听起来有些可悲，但惠勒还建议您浏览照片并观看您所爱的人的旧视频。
惠勒说：“我们现在有了虚拟的支持小组，这是人们分享死亡和悲伤的恐惧的唯一途径，这些恐惧和悲伤混合在一起。”
所以我们在这里经历着双重悲剧，双重创伤。”

"The rituals around death are so important for healthy grief," said David Kessler, who co-authored the book "On Grief and Grieving," with legendary bereavement expert Elisabeth Kübler-Ross.
Wheeler suggests daily check-ins with as many family members as possible, perhaps on a group platform like Zoom.
While it may sound sad, Wheeler also suggests going through photos and watching old videos of your loved one.
"We have virtual support groups now as the only way people can share their fear of death and grief which have all mixed together," Wheeler said.
So we have kind of a double tragedy, a double trauma going on here."

柏林（CNN）-在蒂罗尔州奥地利流行的冬季运动胜地伊施格尔，奥地利当局因处理冠状病毒爆发而面临集体诉讼，涉及多达2500名游客。
该协会告诉美国有线电视新闻网，它已于上周向因斯布鲁克的检察官办公室提交了一份报告。
奥地利消费者保护协会（Austrian Consumer Protection Association）周一对CNN表示：“今天上午9:00，大约有2500人在蒂罗尔州受到冠状病毒感染的VSV注册。
“因此，消费者保护协会（Verbraucherschutzverein VSV）向维也纳的检察官办公室提交了对提洛尔当局的事实描述。
当被征询意见时，蒂罗尔州的医疗机构将CNN移交给了Platter办公室的声明。

Berlin (CNN) — Austrian authorities are facing a class action lawsuit involving as many as 2,500 tourists over their handling of a coronavirus outbreak in the popular Austrian winter sports resort of Ischgl , in Tyrol province.
The association told CNN it had filed a report with the public prosecutor's office in Innsbruck last week.
The Austrian Consumer Protection Association told CNN on Monday: ''Today as of 9:00 a.m. about 2,500 people have registered with the VSV who are affected by a coronavirus infection in Tyrol.
"The Verbraucherschutzverein VSV (Consumer Protection Association) has therefore submitted a description of the facts to the Public Prosecutor's Office in Vienna against the Tyrolean authorities.
When approached for comment, the medical authority in Tyrol referred CNN to the statement from Platter's office.

而且由于国际农民及其供应链也面临类似的问题，因此我们可以减少粮食进口，从而可能限制供应并推高价格。
H-2A工人被政府视为必不可少的，应被允许在美国工作。
美国消费的许多新鲜水果和蔬菜都是在国际上种植的。
FDA去年表示，美国每年消费的新鲜蔬菜和新鲜水果中约有32％是进口的。
某些水果（例如香蕉）几乎完全在美国境外种植。

And because international farmers and their supply chains face similar problems, we could receive fewer food imports, potentially limiting supply and driving up prices.
H-2A workers have been deemed essential by the government, and should be allowed to work in the United States.
Much of the fresh fruits and vegetables that are consumed in the United States are grown internationally.
The FDA said last year that about 32% of fresh vegetables and 55% of fresh fruit consumed in the United States each year are imported.
Certain fruit, like bananas, are grown almost entirely outside of the United States.

英国电影制片人李·舒尔曼（Lee Shulman）表示，这是他精选的新书《中世纪记忆：匿名项目》中的其中一张，汇集了300幅可追溯至1950年代的Kodachrome幻灯片。
Kodachrome幻灯片是装在纸板中的彩色反转片的矩形块，它们被装入幻灯片放映机中并投射到墙壁上。
自2017年以来，舒尔曼已收集了超过700,000张Kodachrome幻灯片，作为总部位于巴黎的非营利性计划Anonymous Project的一部分，该计划收集，扫描，数字化和分类自20世纪中叶以来生产的彩色负片和幻灯片。
这位电影制片人出于好奇并以很少的钱从eBay买了几把1950年代的Kodachrome盒子后开始收集幻灯片。
舒尔曼说，来自世界各地的人们都给他寄了几箱旧的Kodachrome幻灯片，其中一些在阁楼上已经被遗忘了多年。

British filmmaker Lee Shulman says it's one of his favorite images in " Midcentury Memories: The Anonymous Project ," a new book he curated that brings together 300 Kodachrome slides dating back to the 1950s.
Kodachrome slides are rectangular pieces of color reversal film encased in cardboard that were loaded into slide projectors and beamed onto walls.
Since 2017, Shulman has collected over 700,000 Kodachrome slides as part of The Anonymous Project, a Paris-based non-profit initiative that gathers, scans, digitizes and catalogs color photographic negatives and slides produced since the mid-20th century.
The filmmaker began collecting slides after buying a couple of 1950s Kodachrome boxes from eBay out of curiosity, and for very little money.
Shulman said people from all over the world have sent him boxes of old Kodachrome slides, some of which have been forgotten for years in their attics.

（CNN）当苏塞克斯公爵和公爵夫人宣布将放弃其高级皇室职位以实现“经济独立”时，这在英国机构中引起了震惊，并成为全国乃至全国范围内激烈辩论的话题。
萨塞克斯郡发言人说：“萨塞克斯郡公爵夫人希望在最近几周和几个月内，重点仍放在全球对Covid-19的反应上。”
“但是，我们认识到在他们的家庭过渡期限之后，还有与他们的未来有关的悬而未决的问题。”
3月31日标志着他们成为高级皇室成员的时代已经结束，并开始了他们的新生活，这种未来将不再为他们的非营利组织，网站或Instagram帐户使用名称“ Sussex Royal”。
当这对夫妇正式放弃皇室职务时，我们可以从他们的过渡中看到以下内容。

(CNN) When the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced they would be giving up their senior royal roles to become "financially independent," it sent shock waves through the British establishment and became the topic of intense debate across the country and beyond.
"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex would prefer that in the immediate weeks and months, the focus remains on the global response to Covid-19," a Sussex spokesperson said.
"However, we recognize there are outstanding questions relating to their future beyond their Household transition deadline."
That future includes no longer using the name "Sussex Royal" for their nonprofit organization, website or Instagram account , as March 31 marks the end of their time as senior royals and the start of their new life.
As the couple officially relinquishes their royal duties, here's what we can expect to see from their transition.

后来空袭被认为是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

Mjøstårnet的高度达到280英尺，于去年开放后成为世界上最高的木材建筑。
长期倡导和设计木制建筑的建筑师Michael Green表示，“现在有很多东西在融合。”
Or Framework是位于俄勒冈州波特兰的一座雄心勃勃的148英尺高的木塔，在去年因成本担忧而被取消之前，该塔被设定为美国最高的木塔。
考虑到在2018年之前，俄勒冈州成为美国第一个允许使用18层木制建筑的州，而在美国，没有任何地方允许任何超过6层的建筑物，这一决定意义重大。
该组织表示，除了担心森林砍伐外，洒水喷头不能有效防止烈焰扩散到木结构建筑中。

Reaching 280 feet in height, Mjøstårnet became the world's tallest timber building upon opening last year.
According to architect Michael Green, a longstanding advocate for -- and designer of -- wooden buildings, there are "a whole bunch of things converging right now."
Or Framework, an ambitious 148-foot-tall timber tower in Portland, Oregon, that was set to be the USA's tallest wooden tower before was canceled amid cost concerns last year.
The decision is significant given that, before 2018, when Oregon became the first US state to allow 18-story wooden buildings, nowhere in America permitted anything higher than six.
In addition to concerns about deforestation, the group says sprinklers are ineffective at preventing blazes from spreading through wood buildings.
