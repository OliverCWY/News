(CNN) When the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced they would be giving up their senior royal roles to become "financially independent," it sent shock waves through the British establishment and became the topic of intense debate across the country and beyond.

Why are they doing it? How will they survive? And what do the rest of the family think about it?

So much has happened in the weeks since that such questions are no longer top of mind, as the couple said in a statement Monday ahead of their official transition to being non-working members of the royal family.

"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex would prefer that in the immediate weeks and months, the focus remains on the global response to Covid-19," a Sussex spokesperson said. "However, we recognize there are outstanding questions relating to their future beyond their Household transition deadline."

That future includes no longer using the name "Sussex Royal" for their nonprofit organization, website or Instagram account , as March 31 marks the end of their time as senior royals and the start of their new life. As the couple officially relinquishes their royal duties, here's what we can expect to see from their transition.
