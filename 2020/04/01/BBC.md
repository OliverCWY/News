看来，基于土豆的幽默正在使我们整日忙于意外的奇迹（请参阅我们之前的帖子，老板在这里做土豆会议）。
当喜剧演员马特·卢卡斯（Matt Lucas）用歌词更新一首20岁的喜剧歌曲以提供避免冠状病毒的建议时，他希望大约有500人观看。
但是，他修改过的《烤土豆之歌》（上面的视频）的观看次数现已达到300万，他将发布该视频以为其FeedNHS活动筹集资金。
在他的新化身中，他的烤土豆角色指示人们洗手，留在室内且不要触摸自己的脸。
您可以在此处详细了解他的筹款活动。

It seems that potato-based humour is working unexpected wonders in getting us through the day (see our earlier post about a boss conducting a meeting as a potato here).
When comedian Matt Lucas updated a 20-year-old comedy song with lyrics to give advice about avoiding coronavirus, he expected about 500 people to watch it.
But the video for his revised Baked Potato Song (above) has now had three million views, and he is about to release it to raise funds for his FeedNHS campaign.
In its new incarnation, his baked potato character instructs people to wash their hands, stay indoors and not touch their faces.
You can read more about his fundraising campaign here.

However, the company has a reputation for pushing back against workers who try to unionise and taking a hard line against workers who speak out publicly.

在英国，这一比例甚至更低，只有34％的同一年龄段的人拥有财产（1996年为55％）。
可移动的别具一格的租赁植物“现房是一所房子，无论是否租用，”现居纽约的27岁房客切尔西·布朗（Chelsey Brown）说。
例如，我一直想在家中使用墙板，因此想出了一种安装临时护墙板的方法。
此外，我一直梦想拥有一个白色的大理石厨房，并通过使用可移动的粘手式产品在自己的租金中实现了这种外观。补充。
布朗目前正在为出租人开发一系列可移动产品，例如粘滞地板砖和可移动后挡板，其灵感来自于她对出租物业进行大修的经验。

In the UK this is even lower, with just 34% of people in the same age group owning property (compared to 55% in 1996).
Removable chic, rental plants“A house is a home whether it’s rented or not,” says renter Chelsey Brown, 27, who resides in New York.
For example, I’ve always wanted wall panelling in my home and so I figured out a way to install temporary wainscoting.
Additionally, I’ve always dreamed of having a white, marble kitchen and I achieved that look in my own rental by using removable, peel-and-stick products.”For some young renters, personalising a home can come down to affordable, stylish additions.
Brown is currently working on a range of removable products for renters, such as stick-on floor tiles and removable back splashes inspired by her own experience of overhauling a rental property.

1941年9月8日，纳粹部队从西部和南部，并通过芬兰向北部包围了列宁格勒。
这是列宁格勒被围困的开始，这是历史上损失惨重的生命。
随着人口的饥饿，人们闻所未闻地谋求配给卡和吃尸体的情况并非鲜见。
尽管人们处于绝望的境地，但是如果您知道在哪里寻找食物的话，仍然有一种食物来源保持不变。
要了解这一点，我们需要问什么使食物变质。

On 8 September 1941, Nazi forces surrounded Leningrad from the west and south, and through Finland to the north.
This was the beginning of the Siege of Leningrad, the costliest in terms of lives lost in history.
As the population starved, it was not unheard of for people to murder for ration cards and eat corpses.
Despite people’s desperate condition, there was one source of food that remained untouched if you knew where to look.
To understand that, we need to ask what makes food go off.

在这些奇怪的日子里，社交媒体上流露出一种轻松的情绪：“不要给您的前任发短信”。
新的HBO系列Run正是利用这种普遍的神经症-充满幽默感和情感力量。
（也许更令人惊讶的是，她在《 Run》中饰演的客串是中西部动物标本剥制者和好撒玛利亚人。）
Run确实的确以ex的文字开头。
Run是她才华横溢的真正工具，这在一定程度上吸引了她的注意力，展示了她的多维才能。

In these strange days, one light-hearted refrain has rung out across social media: “don’t text your ex”.
It is this universal neurosis that new HBO series Run taps into – with both comic nuance and emotional force.
(Though more surprising perhaps is her acting cameo in Run as a Midwestern taxidermist and good Samaritan).
Run does indeed begin with a text from an ex.
Run is a real vehicle for her talents, which gives her the spotlight in a part that showcases her gift for multi-dimensionality.
