The scientists modelling the outbreak keep emphasising that there can be no certainty about the timing of what will happen next in the UK.

The current hope is the peak may be reached in seven to 10 days but that’s based on computer simulations, which rely on a host of assumptions.

In an email on Monday morning, one of the scientists told me that everything depended “on social distancing having the expected effect and remaining in place”.

Another big question is about the "shape" of the peak – whether it will be like a steep mountain or more of a plateau.

In one scenario, known as "most likely", there would be "a reasonably rapid decline following the peak but still not dropping to low levels for one to two months".

And in another, described as "reasonable worst case", the decline would be much slower and stretch out over several months.

In both scenarios, I’m told, social distancing would need to be kept in place – another reminder of the long haul ahead.
