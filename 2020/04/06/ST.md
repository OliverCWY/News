吉隆坡（彭博社，星空/亚洲新闻网）-马来西亚和新加坡正在讨论马来西亚公民从共和国返回自己的祖国的新条款，这将在马来西亚国防部长周二（4月7日）宣布。 Ismail Sabri Yaakob在周一（4月6日）说。
外交部在回应媒体询问时说：“新加坡政府目前没有要求以非临床理由擦拭离开新加坡的外国人。”
吉隆坡没有对通过吉隆坡国际机场等进入马来西亚的其他人施加类似的测试要求，也没有在外国工人返乡之前对该国的外国工人进行测试。
他说：“我相信外交部将在明天（星期二）的会议上向我们通报马来西亚和新加坡商定的新条件。”
伊斯梅尔·萨布里（Ismail Sabri）先生说：“但目前，我们不允许新加坡的马来西亚人返回。”他补充说，成千上万的马来西亚人正在设法返回。

KUALA LUMPUR (BLOOMBERG, THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Malaysia and Singapore are discussing new terms for the return of Malaysian citizens from the Republic to their home country, which will be announced as soon as Tuesday (April 7), Malaysian Defence Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said on Monday (April 6).
“There is currently no requirement by the Government of Singapore for foreigners exiting Singapore to be swabbed for non-clinical grounds,” the ministry said in response to media queries.
Kuala Lumpur does not impose a similar testing requirement on others entering Malaysia, such as via Kuala Lumpur International Airport, nor does it test foreign workers in the country before they return home.
“I believe that the Foreign Ministry will inform us at the meeting tomorrow (Tuesday) on what are the new conditions agreed upon by Malaysia and Singapore,” he said.
“But for now, we won’t allow Malaysians in Singapore to return,” said Mr Ismail Sabri, adding that there were tens of thousands of Malaysians seeking to make their way back.

那么，世界第三大经济体处于紧急状态意味着什么呢？
2月，北海道北部省长宣布，随着案件的增加，局部地区进入紧急状态，但数周后取消了该措施。
紧急状态使受灾地区的州长有权要求限制人员流动和商业活动，但执法手段却很少。
负责执行紧急状态法律的大臣西村康俊（Yasutoshi Nishimura）表示，将要求居民，而不是命令居民。
紧急措施的状态来自经修订的2012年法案，该法案旨在减缓新型流感的传播。

So what does a state of emergency entail in the world's third-biggest economy?
In February, the governor of northern Hokkaido announced a localised state of emergency as cases increased, but lifted the measure after several weeks.
The state of emergency empowers governors in affected regions to call for restrictions on movement and commerce but offers little in the way of enforcement.
Mr Yasutoshi Nishimura, the minister in charge of the law implementing the state of emergency, said residents would be asked, not ordered.
The state of emergency measure comes from a revised 2012 Bill intended to slow the spread of new strains of flu.

英国歌手达菲（Duffy）在2月下旬在Instagram上透露她长期缺席音乐是由于性侵犯后，分享了有关其强奸案的更多细节。
35岁的歌手艾米·安妮·达菲（Aimee Anne Duffy）写道：“那是我的生日，我在一家餐馆被吸毒，然后被吸毒四周，然后去了国外。”
之后，她“有时甚至几个星期，几个星期又几个星期都不会看到一个人，一个肉体的灵魂”。
诸如Mercy和Warwick Avenue之类的歌曲的歌手感谢她的心理学家，她帮助她在经历了磨难之后得以度过难关。
达菲（Duffy）在2月下旬表示，在去年夏天对一位不愿透露姓名的记者进行采访后，她决定打破自己对创伤的沉默。

British singer Duffy has shared more details about her rape ordeal after she disclosed on Instagram in late February that her long absence from music was due to a sexual assault.
"It was my birthday, I was drugged at a restaurant, I was drugged then for four weeks and travelled to a foreign country," the 35-year-old singer, whose birth name is Aimee Anne Duffy, wrote.
Afterwards, she "would not see someone, a physical soul, for sometimes weeks and weeks and weeks at a time, remaining alone".
The singer of songs such as Mercy and Warwick Avenue thanked her psychologist who helped to pull her through after the ordeal.
Duffy said in late February that she had decided to break her silence over her trauma after giving an interview to an unnamed journalist last summer.
