London (CNN) British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will remain in a London hospital under observation after he was admitted on Sunday night with persistent symptoms of coronavirus.

The Prime Minister's spokesperson said he had a "comfortable" night at St Thomas' Hospital, across Westminster Bridge from Downing Street, and is in "good spirits." The spokesperson would not comment on reports Johnson was given oxygen, but officials are no longer describing his symptoms as mild.

Johnson was admitted to hospital for tests as a precaution, and continues to receive briefing papers, according to the spokesperson. The regular morning briefing on coronavirus was chaired by foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, the most senior Cabinet minister after Johnson.

Last night, on the advice of my doctor, I went into hospital for some routine tests as I'm still experiencing coronavirus symptoms. I'm in good spirits and keeping in touch with my team, as we work together to fight this virus and keep everyone safe. — Boris Johnson \#StayHomeSaveLives (@BorisJohnson) April 6, 2020

Downing Street has previously said Raab would stand in if the Prime Minister were unable to lead the country.

In a post on Twitter, Johnson said he was keeping in touch with his team and thanked staff at Britain's National Health Service for taking care of him.
