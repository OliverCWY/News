与此同时，在上海，著名的外滩滨水区在近几周空无一人之后再次被购物者和游客挤满了。
在首都北京也发生了类似的故事，当地人蜂拥至城市的公园和开放空间。
在中国武汉市首次发现该病毒三个多月后，这种病毒又突然恢复正常。
但是，在政府逐步放宽限制的同时，中国卫生专家敦促公众继续谨慎行事。
在经历了数周的冠状病毒恐惧之后，人群聚集在北京庆祝4月6日的清明节。

Meanwhile in Shanghai, the famous Bund waterfront was once again packed with shoppers and tourists, after weeks of being near deserted.
A similar story played out in the capital Beijing, with locals flocking to the city's parks and open spaces.
The abrupt return to apparent normality comes more than three months after the virus was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
But while the government is slowly relaxing restrictions, Chinese health experts have urged the public to continue to practice caution.
Crowds gather in Beijing to celebrate the Qingming Festival on April 6, after weeks of coronavirus fears.

经济顾问拉里·库德洛（Barry Dan Smialowski）/法新社/ Getty Images / FILEPresident总统特朗普的高级经济顾问拉里·库德洛（Larry Kudlow）表示，该计划旨在帮助受冠状病毒影响的小企业的贷款达到380亿美元，他消除了阻碍该计划推出的小故障。
库德洛在接受CNBC采访时说：“这些小故障将得到解决。
“卫生方面必须先行，”库德洛说。
“我们必须继续将健康方面放在首位，我们认为，缓解措施正在奏效。”
他说，政府的优先事项仍然是援助计划的“第三阶段”。

Economic adviser Larry Kudlow Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images/FILEPresident Trump’s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Monday that loans under the program aimed at assisting small businesses impacted by coronavirus reached $38 billion, and he dismissed glitches that hindered the program’s rollout.
In an interview with CNBC, Kudlow said, "the glitches will get worked.
“The health side has to come first,” Kudlow said.
“The health side must continue to come first and the mitigation efforts, we believe, are working."
He said that the government’s priority remains “phase three” of an assistance program.

这个故事的一个版本出现在4月6日的CNN的冠状病毒：事实与小说通讯中。
一名医院工作人员包裹了一名死者的尸体。
Lauren del Valle和Miguel Marquez写道，这就是冠状病毒对成千上万美国人所做的事情，并且可能对成千上万的美国人如此。
美国外科医生本周已告诉美国人为“珍珠港时刻”做好准备，因为全国死亡人数接近10,000。
在意大利，西班牙和法国，在非洲大陆以及全球受灾最严重的国家中，死亡人数和感染率似乎正在放缓。

A version of this story appeared in the April 6 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter.
A hospital worker wrapped the body of a deceased patient.
This is what coronavirus is doing to thousands of Americans, and likely will to many thousands more, Lauren del Valle and Miguel Marquez write .
The US Surgeon General has told Americans this week to brace themselves for a "Pearl Harbor moment," as the national death toll nears 10,000.
Fatalities and infections seem to be slowing in Italy, Spain and France, among the hardest-hit countries on the continent -- and in the world.

"It was my birthday, I was drugged at a restaurant, I was drugged then for four weeks and travelled to a foreign country.
Duffy said she escaped by "fleeing" but did not provide details of how she got away, adding she "cannot remember getting home."
Hopefully no more 'what happened to Duffy questions', now you know ... and I am free."

（CNN）纳迪亚（Nadia）是纽约布朗克斯动物园（Bronx Zoo）的一只老虎，她已经成为首例检测冠状病毒呈阳性的人。
野生动物保护协会的布朗克斯动物园在新闻稿中说，这只4岁的马来亚雌性老虎在干咳后测试呈阳性，有望恢复。纳迪亚的样品是在老虎和其他五只老虎和狮子之后被采集和测试的。根据美国农业部（USDA）的说法，在动物园里开始出现呼吸道疾病的症状。
动物园中没有其他动物出现症状。
动物园说：“尽管它们的食欲有所下降，但在布朗克斯动物园的猫在兽医的照管下表现良好，并且聪明，机敏并能与饲养员互动。”
“由于不同物种对新型感染的反应不同，因此尚不清楚这种疾病在大猫中将如何发展，但我们将继续密切监测它们并期待其完全康复。”

(CNN) Nadia, a tiger at the Bronx Zoo in New York, has become the first of her kind to test positive for the coronavirus.
The 4-year-old female Malayan tiger tested positive after developing a dry cough and is expected to recover, the Wildlife Conservation Society's Bronx Zoo said in a news releaseSamples from Nadia were taken and tested after the tiger -- and five other tigers and lions at the zoo -- began showing symptoms of respiratory illness, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).
No other animals at the zoo are showing symptoms.
"Though they have experienced some decrease in appetite, the cats at the Bronx Zoo are otherwise doing well under veterinary care and are bright, alert, and interactive with their keepers," the zoo said.
"It is not known how this disease will develop in big cats since different species can react differently to novel infections, but we will continue to monitor them closely and anticipate full recoveries."

有了Covid-19，我们没有理由认为乡下的人比纽约市的人受到的感染要少。

All I spoke to did so on condition of anonymity; all felt they were better placed to outrun Covid-19 if they were not stuck in high-density areas like New York City.
One person I know has her family's food driven out from New York City every day.
Harvard-trained epidemiologist Dr. Ashwin Vasan told me that he's heard disturbing stories of wealthy individuals procuring their own ventilators.
"Long Island does not have as elaborate a health care system as New York City ... and that has us very concerned," he said.
With Covid-19 there is no reason to think that people in the countryside are any less infected than the people in New York City.

纽约州立大学下州分校已经提供了50多名医护人员提供帮助，其中一些已经在前线。

"It's not the hospital it's the nature of the disease," Dr. Lorenzo Paladino, an emergency medicine physician, told CNN.
More and more patients are coming to SUNY Downstate by the day, its doctors said.
Ninety-four people have died from complications related to Covid-19 at SUNY Downstate since the pandemic hit three weeks ago.
"We're really taking a lot of tactics from military medicine to do this disaster medicine," said SUNY Downstate President Dr. Wayne Riley.
SUNY Downstate has had more than 50 healthcare workers offer to help and some are already on the frontlines.

就在几天前，他的妻子布兰迪（Brandy）的冠状病毒检测结果呈阳性，但结果并不多。
追求的另一种途径是首先更好地了解人体的免疫系统对病毒和细菌的反应。
在一些年轻，健康的人中，非常活跃的免疫系统可能会导致大规模的炎症性风暴，使肺和其他器官不堪重负。
在这些情况下，问题不在于免疫系统老化或衰弱，而是在于它运作得很好。
一些前线临床医生推测这就是为什么类固醇（一种免疫系统抑制剂）似乎对某些人有益的原因。

Just a few days earlier, his wife, Brandy, had tested positive for coronavirus , but there wasn't much to it.
Another avenue being pursued is better understanding how your body's immune system responds to viruses and bacteria in the first place.
In some young, healthy people, a very reactive immune system could lead to a massive inflammatory storm that could overwhelm the lungs and other organs.
In those cases, it is not an aged or weakened immune system that is the problem -- it is one that works too well.
Some front line clinicians have speculated that is why steroids, an immune system suppressant, seem to offer benefit in some people.

（CNN）国土安全部和疾病控制与预防中心目前正在限制到达美国的游轮乘客和船员登上国内商业航班。
该限制甚至适用于没有症状的人，并且还需要对邮轮乘客和船员进行14天隔离。
美国有线电视新闻网报道了在周日早些时候敲定的限制。
一位政府官员说，这些新协议很可能是游轮公司与政府之间的协议，要求遵守这些协议，以便这些船在特定港口停靠。
该官员补充说，可能会有一系列例外情况和具体情况，这些偏离新议定书的地方，特别是与船上外国人有关的例外。

(CNN) The Department of Homeland Security and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are now restricting cruise ship passengers and crew arriving in the US from boarding domestic commercial flights.
The restrictions will apply even to people not showing symptoms and also would require 14-day quarantines for cruise passengers and crew.
CNN reported on the restrictions being finalized earlier Sunday.
An administration official said these new protocols would likely be agreements between cruise ship companies and the government, requiring that they be followed in order for these ships to dock at specific ports.
That official added that there could be a range of exceptions and specific circumstances that would divert from the new protocols, specifically as it relates to foreigners on the ships.

CNNG德国电影制片人兼摄影师FranziskaStünkel由Allyssia Alleyne撰写，围绕发现人们错过的事物，进行了创造性的实践。
她在一封电子邮件中说：“反射每天环绕着我们，但我们看不到它们。”
Stünkel的每张照片都落在Photoshop拼贴和超现实主义梦想之间，展现出一种叙事的分层效果，暗示着并非真的存在的联系。
图片来源：FranziskaStünkel现在，Stünkel已将110张照片收集到她的新书“共存”中，该书通过德国出版商Kehrer Verlag发行。
信用：礼貌FranziskaStünkel：“我们不能孤立地看待自己……我们彼此负有责任，”她说。

Written by Allyssia Alleyne, CNNGerman filmmaker and photographer Franziska Stünkel has built a creative practice around seeing the things people miss.

Falling somewhere between a Photoshopped collage and a surreal dream, each of Stünkel's photos suggests a narrative, the layered effect insinuating connections that aren't really there.

但这是一个明智的举动，因为人类正在探索未知的事物，他们想保护宇航员。
来自火星NASA下一代火星探测器“恒心”的归还样品将于明年登陆Jezero Crater的火星。
实际会接触火星表面的航天器的零件已消毒，并以662华氏度发射。
格林关于火星任务的想法包括在一个地点着陆，然后在另一个地点单独居住，并建立“探索区”。
如果在火星上发现了生命，那么波士顿的研究使她相信，生命将深处地下。

But it was a smart move because humans were exploring the unknown and they wanted to protect the astronauts.
Returning samples from MarsNASA's next generation of Martian rover, named Perseverance, will land on Mars in Jezero Crater next year.
Parts of the spacecraft that will actually touch the Martian surface are sterilized, fired at 662 degrees Fahrenheit.
Green's idea of a Mars mission includes landing in one spot and separately living in another and setting up an "exploration zone."
If life is found on Mars, Boston's research has led her to believe that it will be deep beneath the surface.

## 特朗普把美国人的生命放在中国的手中

中国：美国赖以提供设备以拯救美国人生命的国家。
特朗普政府应该有一个适当的策略，在大流行病蔓延到祖国之前充分储存和分发关键物资。
但是，他和总统的坚持将这种病毒称为“中国病毒”或“武汉病毒”，在多个方面都没有成功。
如今，由于美国人的生活取决于中共同意向美国出口医疗用品，因此口水战已冷却。
特朗普政府和其他官员需要立即采取行动挽救生命。

China: The country the United States is relying on to supply equipment to save American lives.
The Trump administration should have had a strategy in place to adequately stockpile and distribute key supplies before the pandemic hit the homeland.
But his -- and the President's -- insistence on referring to the virus as the "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus" was a misfire on multiple fronts.
Now, with American lives depending on the Chinese Communist Party agreeing to export medical supplies to the United States, the war of words has cooled .
The Trump administration and other officials need to do what it takes to save lives right now.

## 历史上最致命的空袭发生在二战期间的东京，您可能从未听说过

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
后来空袭被认为是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

## 木摩天大楼革命终于到来了吗？

### Has the wooden skyscraper revolution finally arrived?

Mjøstårnet的高度达到280英尺，于去年开放后成为世界上最高的木材建筑。
长期倡导和设计木制建筑的建筑师Michael Green表示，“现在有很多东西在融合。”
Or Framework是位于俄勒冈州波特兰的一座雄心勃勃的148英尺高的木塔，在去年因成本担忧而被取消之前，该塔被设定为美国最高的木塔。
考虑到在2018年之前，俄勒冈州成为美国第一个允许使用18层木制建筑的州，而在美国，没有任何地方允许任何超过6层的建筑物，这一决定意义重大。
该组织表示，除了担心森林砍伐外，洒水喷头不能有效防止烈焰扩散到木结构建筑中。

Reaching 280 feet in height, Mjøstårnet became the world's tallest timber building upon opening last year.
According to architect Michael Green, a longstanding advocate for -- and designer of -- wooden buildings, there are "a whole bunch of things converging right now."
Or Framework, an ambitious 148-foot-tall timber tower in Portland, Oregon, that was set to be the USA's tallest wooden tower before was canceled amid cost concerns last year.
The decision is significant given that, before 2018, when Oregon became the first US state to allow 18-story wooden buildings, nowhere in America permitted anything higher than six.
In addition to concerns about deforestation, the group says sprinklers are ineffective at preventing blazes from spreading through wood buildings.
