(CNN) In the span of 40 minutes inside one New York City emergency room, six patients went into cardiac arrest, and four died before they made it out of the ER. There was no time to regroup.

A hospital worker wrapped the body of a deceased patient. A half hour later, the body was gone, the space sanitized, and another critically ill patient arrived, coughing, with an oxygen mask on his face.

The US Surgeon General has told Americans this week to brace themselves for a "Pearl Harbor moment," as the national death toll nears 10,000.
