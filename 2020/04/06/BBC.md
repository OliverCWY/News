为疫情建模的科学家一直在强调，无法确定英国下一步发生的时间。
目前的希望是可能在7到10天之内达到峰值，但这是基于计算机模拟的，该模拟依赖于许多假设。
在星期一早上的一封电子邮件中，一位科学家告诉我，一切都取决于“社会疏远是否具有预期的效果并保持不变”。
在另一种被描述为“合理的最坏情况”的情况下，下降速度会慢得多，并会持续几个月。
有人告诉我，在这两种情况下，都需要保持社交距离，这再次提醒了人们长期的努力。

The scientists modelling the outbreak keep emphasising that there can be no certainty about the timing of what will happen next in the UK.
The current hope is the peak may be reached in seven to 10 days but that’s based on computer simulations, which rely on a host of assumptions.
In an email on Monday morning, one of the scientists told me that everything depended “on social distancing having the expected effect and remaining in place”.
And in another, described as "reasonable worst case", the decline would be much slower and stretch out over several months.
In both scenarios, I’m told, social distancing would need to be kept in place – another reminder of the long haul ahead.

有一天，一切结束了，兰登·斯普拉德林牧师的妻子和五个孩子希望为他举行大型的纪念馆。
在狂欢节上，这个家庭乐队在新奥尔良繁忙的杰克逊广场（Jackson Square）演出，没有意识到他们面临的威胁。
尽管距美国首例冠状病毒病例已经过去一个多月，但狂欢节仍按计划进行。
斯普拉德林牧师是生病的人之一，但对Covid-19的测试结果为阴性。
3月13日，Spradlin牧师在Facebook上分享了一篇误导性帖子，比较了猪流感和冠状病毒死亡情况。

One day when this is all over, the wife and five children of Pastor Landon Spradlin hope to hold a large celebratory memorial for him.
At Mardi Gras, the family band played in New Orleans' busy Jackson Square, unaware of the threat they faced.
Even though it had been more than a month since the first coronavirus case in the US, Mardi Gras went on as planned.
Pastor Spradlin was one of those who became ill, but tested negative for Covid-19.
On the 13th of March Pastor Spradlin shared on Facebook a misleading post comparing swine flu and coronavirus deaths.

您可能已经注意到您的一些同事是如何担任领导角色的，如水落石出。
对于其他人而言，情况无异于：在周围的人处处处感到尴尬，and琐的自我怀疑掩盖了每个决定。
如果您属于后一组，您可能会想知道为什么要成为领导者会让您感到恐惧，以及为什么觉得自己很难成为经理。
如果您的父母使紫罗兰萎缩，那么您也同样会增加几率。
关键是父母对您的举止。

You’ve probably noticed how some of your colleagues take to leadership roles like a duck to water.
It couldn’t be more different for others: bossing around people feels awkward, and a nagging self-doubt shadows every decision.
If you’re in the latter group, you might wonder why the thought of being a leader fills you with dread, and why you find it so hard to even see yourself as a manager.
If your parents were shrinking violets, the odds are increased that you will be too.
And key here is the way your parents behaved toward you.

《非洲之眼》的一项调查揭示了Spencon破产的内幕。
罗斯（Ross）和哈斯韦尔（Haswell）在内罗毕（Nairobi）进行救援任务：拯救陷入困境的肯尼亚建筑巨头Spencon。
去年《非洲之眼》（African Eye）到那里探望他时，他沮丧地说道：“我过去常常像男人那样照顾家人。”
哈斯韦尔对《非洲之眼》表示，汽车投射出的是一种有组织的形象，而不是接近破产的形象。
《非洲眼》（Africa Eye）显示了向杰里米·卡弗（Jeremy Carver）支付的8万美元的证据，杰弗里·卡弗是帮助起草英国反贿赂法律的律师。

An Africa Eye investigation reveals the inside story of how Spencon went bust.
Ross and Haswell were in Nairobi on a rescue mission: to save the struggling Kenyan construction giant Spencon.
"I used to take care of my family like a man should," he said, dejectedly, when Africa Eye visited him there last year.
Haswell told Africa Eye the cars projected an image of an organisation of substance rather than one close to insolvency.
Africa Eye showed evidence of the $80,000 payment to Jeremy Carver, a lawyer who helped draft the UK's anti-bribery laws.

图片版权Reuters成千上万的英国驾驶者赢得了针对大众汽车的最高法院诉讼的第一阶段，该诉讼涉及在其柴油车辆中安装排放作弊装置。
在高等法院审理的此案是大众汽车面临的全球性诉讼风暴中的最新一次。
使用故障排除装置意味着大众汽车的汽车被证明符合欧盟污染标准。
瓦克斯曼法官（Justice Waksman）将大众汽车的一些论点描述为，这些车辆不包含失灵装置是“完全不相关”，“无希望”和“严重缺陷”。
但是，在英国，大众汽车公司一直拒绝使用禁止使用的失灵设备-并坚称其客户没有遭受任何损失，因此无需任何赔偿。

Image copyright ReutersThousands of UK motorists have won the first stage of a High Court action against Volkswagen over the installation of emissions cheating devices in its diesel vehicles.
The case being heard at the High Court is the latest in a global storm of litigation facing VW.
The use of defeat devices meant that Volkswagen's cars were certified as conforming to EU pollution standards.
Mr Justice Waksman described some of Volkswagen’s arguments that the vehicles did not contain defeat devices as “completely irrelevant”, “hopeless” and “highly flawed”.
But here in the UK, Volkswagen has consistently denied using prohibited defeat devices - and insists its customers have not suffered any losses, so there is no need for any compensation.

At the same time the month-long oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia has left the global market with far more crude than is needed.

On Thursday oil prices rose by more than 20%, the biggest one-day leap on record, on signs that an end was in sight for the dispute.
Mr Trump had said he expected the two sides to cut supply, while Saudi Arabia called for an emergency meeting of oil producers.

我们DNA中的偏执狂是否仍是我们对必要时回到“另一种”方式的恐惧的残余？
彼得，现年71岁，达林顿一世，铅笔，虽然我看上去很简单，但值得您惊奇和敬畏……如果您能够意识到我所象征的奇迹，便可以帮助拯救人类如此不幸地失去的自由。
正如上面引用的精彩论文《 I-Pencil》所描述的，甚至看似简单的物体（例如石墨铅笔）也来自世界各地成千上万的手。
如果我们完全诚实的话，我们所有人中可能都存在一些仇外心理，种族主义，性别歧视和偏执狂。
对于我们担心与我们不同的其他人（仇外心理）和他们的观点不宽容（偏执），这也是正确的。

Is bigotry in our DNA, a remnant of our fear of “the other” way back when that was necessary?
Peter, 71, DarlingtonI, Pencil, simple though I appear to be, merit your wonder and awe … if you can become aware of the miraculousness which I symbolise, you can help save the freedom mankind is so unhappily losing.
Even seemingly simple objects like a graphite pencil are the work of thousands of hands from around the world, as the wonderful essay I-Pencil, quoted above, describes.
If we are completely honest, there is perhaps a little bit of xenophobia, racism, sexism and bigotry deep within all of us.
This is also true for our fear of others who are different to us – xenophobia – and intolerance of their viewpoints – bigotry.

## 为什么旧金山最好的酸面团

1848年，詹姆斯·W·马歇尔（James W Marshall）在旧金山以北的山丘中发现了黄金，这引发了史诗般的规模迁移。
不知何故，这种面包比其他地方味道更鲜，更香，因此诞生了旧金山酸面团。
170多年后的今天，旧金山是酸面包的代名词。
旧金山和酸面包之间的另一个联系是：该地区长期存在的，注重原料的精神。
他们碰巧遇到了当时未被列入目录的细菌，因此给它起了一个名字：旧金山的乳酸杆菌，继旧金山之后，仍然认为它是海湾地区特有的。

When James W Marshall discovered gold in the hills north of San Francisco in 1848, it sparked a migration of epic proportions.
Somehow, the bread tasted tangier and more flavourful than it did elsewhere, and thus San Francisco sourdough was born.
More than 170 years later, San Francisco is synonymous with sourdough bread.
Another link between San Francisco and sourdough bread: the region’s long-running, ingredients-focused ethos.
They happened upon a then-uncatalogued bacterium, so they gave it a name: lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, after San Francisco, still believing it was Bay Area-unique.

她补充说：“我不会看到一个人，一个肉体的灵魂，有时一个星期又几个星期又几个星期独自呆着。”

Her lengthy written account, in which she does not name her attacker, comes a month after she posted the first details on Instagram.
She wrote on her website: "It was my birthday, I was drugged at a restaurant, I was drugged then for four weeks and travelled to a foreign country.
But Duffy didn't reveal whether they investigated the original ordeal.
"I would not see someone, a physical soul, for sometimes weeks and weeks and weeks at a time, remaining alone," she added.

如果您在努力获取新鲜的药草和香料（并且不能种植），请使用广口瓶。
虽然充满热情的香料架可以提高各种菜肴的吸引力，但您当然可以通过购买一些关键必需品来节省空间和现金。
混合草药会进入很多美味的菜肴，但实际上会为这种意大利面条酱增添风味，例如这种简单的意大利面条和肉丸。
咖喱粉当然可以帮助您解决任何咖喱咖喱，例如这款速食鸡科尔马。
如果您可以将它们挤进去，这些草药和香料也将有用处……干辣椒片或辣椒粉–就像可怕的女孩子们说的那样，香料生活！

If you’re struggling to get fresh herbs and spices (and growing them isn’t an option), turn to jars.
While a heartily-filled spice rack can raise the game of all sorts of dishes, you can of course save space and cash by just buying a few key essentials.
Mixed herbs will go into lots of savoury dishes, but really add flavour to pasta sauces like this easy spaghetti and meatballs.
Curry powder will of course help you with any, ahem, curry, like this quick chicken korma.
If you can squeeze them in, these herbs and spices will also go far…Dried chilli flakes or chilli powder – as the formidable girl group said, Spice Up Your Life\!

喜剧演员罗曼什·兰加纳森（Romesh Ranganathan）选择了亚恩·马特尔（Yann Martel）迷人的畅销书《 Pi生活》。
小说讲述了皮特·帕特尔（Pi Patel）的故事，他是一个在海上漂流数月的男孩，被困在一条带老虎的救生艇上。
随着冒险的进行以及Pi与老虎的刀锋关系（由于管理员错误，他被命名为Richard Parker），这种关系变得越来越引人注目。
Ranganathan说：“因为这是一个与您建立了关系并真正了解的脆弱的小男孩，这让我感到更加恐惧。”
最后还有惊人的转折……但是您必须阅读这本书（好吧，或者看电影大片改编）以了解它的含义。

Stand-up comedian Romesh Ranganathan picks Yann Martel’s enchanting bestseller Life of Pi.
The novel tells the story of Pi Patel, a boy who spends months adrift at sea, trapped on a lifeboat with a tiger.
As the adventure unfolds, and Pi’s knife-edge relationship with the tiger (who’s named Richard Parker, thanks to an admin error) develops, it becomes increasingly compelling.
“Because it’s this fragile little boy that you’ve formed a relationship with and got to really know, it just feels all the more scary,” says Ranganathan.
There’s also a stunning twist towards the end… but you’ll have to read the book (okay, or watch the blockbuster film adaptation) to find out what it is.
