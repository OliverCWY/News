Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Nigerian actress Funke Akindele-Bello has been arrested after hosting a birthday party for her husband during a lockdown in the country -- despite fronting a 'Stay Home' campaign.

The Nollywood comedy star faced backlash after her husband posted a video of the party on his Instagram live feed on Saturday.

News about the party caused outrage among Nigerians who said her actions violated movement restrictions put in place by the government to curb the spread of coronavirus in the city.

The actress was also called out for hypocrisy as she was one of many celebrities who advised people to stay at home in a campaign by Dettol Nigeria to raise awareness about proper hygiene and social distancing.

They were arrested and appeared in court on Monday facing charges connected with breaking the Lagos State Infectious Disease 2020 regulation under the Public Health Law. The couple pleaded guilty and are yet to be sentenced.
