他在一次虚拟新闻发布会上说：“自进入Covid-19大流行以来的第四个月，我对感染的迅速升级和全球蔓延深感关切。”
在接下来的几天中，我们将确认一百万例确诊病例和五万例死亡。”
仅在欧洲，冠状病毒大流行就已经杀死了30,000多人。
“至关重要的是，我们必须确保这些国家具备检测，测试，隔离和治疗Covid-19病例并确定联系人的能力。”
他说，对于Covid-19的行为方式有许多“未知数”，因为它是“世界上首例冠状病毒大流行”。

"As we enter the fourth month since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, I am deeply concerned about the rapid escalation and global spread of infection," he told a virtual news conference.
In the next few days we will reach one million confirmed cases and 50,000 deaths."
The coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 30,000 people in Europe alone.
"It is critical that we ensure these countries are well equipped to detect, test, isolate and treat Covid-19 cases, and identify contacts."
He said there were many "unknowns" about how Covid-19 will behave, as it is the "first-ever coronavirus pandemic in the world".

新加坡-一名68岁的印度尼西亚男子在Covid-19星期四（4月2日）上午死亡，这是新加坡第四次死于冠状病毒。
卫生部（MOH）表示，该患者于周四上午6.43分死于Covid-19感染引起的并发症。
1月20日至3月16日在印度尼西亚居住的新加坡工作准证持有人是一例进口的Covid-19感染病例。
他于3月22日被美国国家传染病中心（NCID）录取，并于同一天被确认患有Covid-19感染。
3月21日，早些时候，一名75岁的新加坡籍女子和一名64岁的印尼籍男子死于该病。

SINGAPORE - A 68-year-old Indonesian man died on Thursday (April 2) morning of Covid-19, Singapore’s fourth death from the coronavirus.

直到1月下旬，全球冠状病毒危机的范围才首次变得清晰时，才向Agiliti支付了3800万美元（5459万新元）的任务。
伦纳德说：“尽管我们正在加快工作以使它们可部署，但我们仍拥有第一批呼吸机。”
通风机是特朗普周日（3月29日）形容的复杂机械，就像“制造汽车”一样复杂。
联邦官员周三透露，他们的医疗装备库存几乎耗尽。
特朗普先生说，他想保留当前的储备，直到明确出现新的热点。

Agiliti was not given the US$38 million (S$54.59 million) task until late January, when the scope of the global coronavirus crisis was first becoming clear.
"We still have that first tranche of ventilators, although we're accelerating the work to get them deployable," Mr Leonard said.
Ventilators are sensitive machinery that Mr Trump described on Sunday (March 29) as so complex they were like "building a car."
Federal officials revealed on Wednesday that their stockpile of medical gear was nearly depleted.
Mr Trump said he wanted to hold the current stockpile in reserve until it was clear where new hot spots would emerge.

马尼拉（路透社）-菲律宾总统罗德里戈·杜特尔特警告违规者采取冠状病毒封锁措施，可能会因造成麻烦而对其开枪，并说虐待医务人员是严重的罪行，不能容忍。
所以我再次告诉你问题的严重性，你必须听取。”杜特尔特先生在星期三晚些时候（4月1日）说。
如果遇到麻烦，有时他们会反击并且您的生命处于危险之中，请杀死他们。
他们还追随医学界对社会污名化以及医院工作人员遭受身体虐待和歧视的愤慨，杜特尔特先生说，必须制止这种情况。
国家警察局长星期四说，警察了解杜特尔特先生正在表现出他对公共秩序的认真态度，不会有人被枪杀。

MANILA (REUTERS) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has warned violators of coronavirus lockdown measures that they could be shot for causing trouble, and said abuse of medical workers was a serious crime that would not be tolerated.
So once again I'm telling you the seriousness of the problem and that you must listen," Mr Duterte said late on Wednesday (April 1).
If there is trouble and there's an occasion that they fight back and your lives are in danger, shoot them dead.
They also follow outrage among the medical community about social stigma and instances of hospital workers suffering physical abuse and discrimination, which Mr Duterte said must be stopped.
The national police chief on Thursday said police understood that Mr Duterte was demonstrating his seriousness about public order, and no one would be shot.

澳大利亚各州已指示警察对违反联邦命令的人处以最高11,000澳元（9,604新元）的罚款，该命令禁止不必要的旅行，并将在外面聚集的人群限制为两个人。
新南威尔士州和其他州的警察已经开始向涉嫌违反政府本人称为“严厉命令”的命令的人开票。
澳大利亚卫生部门表示，感染率最近几天似乎有所下降，但要确切地说还为时过早。
在西澳大利亚州，移民官员与也拒绝离开的外国拥有的游轮之间仍然存在对峙。
澳大利亚海事联盟说，在澳大利亚水域，共有11艘外国拥有的游轮处于困境，共有11,000名船员，这种情况是“正在出现的人道主义危机”。

Australian states have instructed police to issue fines of up to A$11,000 (S$9,604) to people who violate federal orders that ban non-essential travel and limit groups of people gathering outside to two.
Police in NSW and other states have already started issuing tickets to people suspected of breaching orders that the authorities themselves have called "draconian".
Australian health authorities have said infection rates appear to have slowed in recent days but it is too early to say definitively.
In Western Australia, a standoff continued between immigration officials and foreign-owned cruise ships which were also refusing to leave.
The Maritime Union of Australia said there were 11 foreign-owned cruise ships in limbo in Australian waters, with 11,000 crew members in total, and their situation was "an emerging humanitarian crisis".

特朗普星期三强烈暗示，如果伊朗的代理部队再次袭击美军，他正在考虑袭击伊朗，并说他的政府“非常有信息”说，伊朗支持的民兵正计划进行更多袭击。
特朗普说：“如果再次发生，那将沿着食物链。”
特朗普在推特上写道：“根据情报和信念，伊朗或其代理人正计划对美军和/或伊拉克资产进行偷袭。”
特朗普的评论是白宫正在考虑对伊朗或其代理部队采取升级行动的最新迹象。
特朗普说，有关袭击事件“不是单挑”。

Mr Trump strongly hinted on Wednesday that he was considering striking Iran if its proxy forces again attacked US troops and said his administration had "very good information" that Iran-backed militias were planning more assaults.
"If it happens again, that would go up the food chain," Mr Trump said.
"Upon information and belief, Iran or its proxies are planning a sneak attack on U.S. troops and/or assets in Iraq," Mr Trump wrote on Twitter.
Mr Trump's comments were the latest indication that the White House was considering escalating action against Iran or its proxy forces.
"It's not a heads-up" about an attack, Mr Trump said.

汉城（路透社）-韩国的流行与冠状病毒的战斗，使流行病对文在寅（Moon Jae-in）及其执政党来说是一个不太大的福音，因为竞选季节将于周四（4月2日）在4月15日举行的议会选举开始。

SEOUL (REUTERS) - South Korea's fierce battle against the coronavirus has turned the pandemic into an unlikely boon for President Moon Jae-in and his ruling party as campaign season kicks off on Thursday (April 2) ahead of parliamentary elections on April 15.
By the time South Korea was hit by the first major outbreak outside of China in February, approval ratings for Mr Moon and his Democratic Party of Korea were already battered by a stagnant economy and more than a year of domestic political scandals.
"In times of a national disaster or crisis, the ruling camp would usually be on the defensive.
So far, Korea has reported a total of 9,976 coronavirus cases and 169 deaths.
Even with the coronavirus boost, experts say victory for the ruling camp is far from assured, as economic growth remains a concern.

全世界许多国家的政府都限制了其人口，以减缓病毒的传播，但是这导致国际贸易和食品供应链的严重放缓。
在2007年全球金融危机之后，稻米生产国印度和越南限制了出口，以防止价格上涨。
它补充说：“各国在采取行动保护其公民的健康和福祉时，应确保任何与贸易有关的措施都不会破坏食品供应链。”
粮农组织，世卫组织和世贸组织领导人还强调，必须保护从事粮食生产，加工和分配的雇员，以维护自身和他人的健康，并维护粮食供应链。
但是粮农组织，世卫组织和世贸组织表示，需要开展合作，以避免因抗击新型冠状病毒而造成的粮食短缺。

Many governments around the world have put their populations on lockdown to slow the spread of the virus but that has resulted in severe slow-downs in international trade and food supply chains.
After the 2007 global financial crisis, rice producing countries India and Vietnam restricted exports to ward off expected price increases.
"When acting to protect the health and well-being of their citizens, countries should ensure that any trade-related measures do not disrupt the food supply chain," it added.
The FAO, WHO and WTO leaders also stressed the need to protect employees engaged in food production, processing and distribution, both for their own health and that of others, as well as to maintain food supply chains.
But the FAO, WHO and WTO said working together is needed to avoid food shortages brought on by measures to combat the novel coronavirus.

纽约（法新社）-由于冠状病毒给人类和经济造成的损失持续增加，并且更多的州政府为了遏制疫情而关闭活动，华尔街股票在星期三（4月1日）遭受重创。
道琼斯工业平均指数下跌约975点或4.4％，收于20,943.51点。

NEW YORK (AFP) - Wall Street stocks were battered on Wednesday (April 1) as the human and economic toll from the coronavirus continued to rise and more state governments shut down activity to try to contain the outbreak.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost about 975 points, or 4.4 per cent to finish the day at 20,943.51.
The broad-based S&P 500 also dropped 4.4 per cent to end at 2,470.50, as did the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index, which closed at 7,360.58.
The rout translated into a bruising open to the second quarter after major indices suffered their biggest losses in years in the January-March period.
Stocks were in the red all day following a gloomy White House press conference Tuesday night when President Donald Trump warned of "hard days" ahead and health experts said the US death count could reach 240,000 people.
