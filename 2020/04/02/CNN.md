当被问到人们是否应该戴口罩时，他有一个简单的回答：“不。”
尽管SARS遍布世界各地，但最严重的流行集中在亚洲，尤其是中国大陆和香港。
然而，在同样的建议中，疾病预防控制中心表示，无症状的“不需要”戴口罩，并补充说，“它们可能供不应求，应该保存起来供看护人使用。”
对于许多人来说，这就是令人沮丧和困惑的地方，尤其是那些提倡戴口罩作为预防措施的人。
即使没有症状传播，也可以使用通用或接近通用的口罩。

Asked if people should wear masks, he had a straightforward answer: "No."
While SARS spread around the world, the worst of the epidemic was focused in Asia, particularly mainland China and Hong Kong.
Yet, in the same advice, the CDC said that non-symptomatic "do not need" to wear face masks, adding that they "may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers."
And this is what has been so frustrating and confusing for many people, particularly those who advocate for wearing face masks as a precaution.
And even if there was not asymptomatic transmission, universal or near universal mask wearing has its uses.

（CNN）要说全球新颖的冠状病毒大流行正在以实际和有形的方式造成混乱并影响生活，这绝不是轻描淡写。
但是，尚未引起广泛关注的一种影响是其传播如何损害各国政府打击跨国有组织犯罪和贩运的努力-尤其是在爆发爆发的亚洲。
尽管跨境人员和货物的流动已经放缓，但鉴于该地区存在数十亿美元的贩运集团，国际和跨界合作比以往任何时候都更加必要。

(CNN) To say the global novel coronavirus pandemic is causing chaos and affecting lives in real and tangible ways is certainly no understatement.
But one impact that has not received significant attention is how its spread is hurting the efforts of governments to combat transnational organized crime and trafficking -- especially in Asia, where the outbreak began.
Though the movement of people and goods across borders has slowed, international and cross-border cooperation is more necessary than ever given the presence of multi-billion dollar trafficking syndicates in the region.

世界银行本周早些时候警告说，在最坏的情况下，14万亿美元的经济可能根本不会增长。
此前，中央银行已注入流动性或分配了超过1.65万亿元人民币（2,320亿美元）的额外贷款。
政府还拨款至少1169亿元人民币（164亿美元）用于抗击该病毒的经济救济和刺激措施。

野村证券（Nomura）估计，到2020年，中国经济将仅增长1％，造成数百万的工作机会流失。

In a worst case scenario, the $14 trillion economy may not grow at all, the World Bank warned earlier this week.
Previously, the central bank had injected liquidity or allocated additional lending worth more than 1.65 trillion yuan ($232 billion).
The government had also allocated at least 116.9 billion yuan ($16.4 billion) in financial relief and stimulus aimed at fighting the virus.

Nomura estimates China's economy will grow by only 1% in 2020, causing millions of job losses.

## Covid-19如何重新定义美国的劳动力

为了减轻痛苦并平衡劳动力市场的波动，企业现在正在组建不太可能的联盟，并达成跨行业协议以重新安置其休假的工人。
在较小的规模上，位于迈阿密的西班牙裔杂货连锁店Sedano's为两家当地餐馆连锁店的工人提供临时就业。
但是劳工和公共政策专家说，这可能预示着美国工作方式的长期转变。
他说，这种做法在欧洲已有悠久的历史，并引用了康奈尔大学劳资关系学院的研究。
尽管该概念仍然是“边际劳动力市场现象”，但康奈尔大学的研究发现，他们通过提供稳定性，工作保障和工作技能的增长而使工人和雇主受益。

Seeking to ease the pain and balance out volatility in the labor market, corporations now are forging unlikely alliances and striking cross-industry agreements to redeploy their furloughed workers.
On a smaller scale, Sedano's, a Miami-based Hispanic grocery chain, offered temporary employment to workers at two local restaurant chains.
But labor and public policy experts say it could signal a long-term shift in how work is done in America.
The practice has a longer history in Europe, he said, referencing studies by Cornell University's Industrial and Labor Relations School.
Although the concept remains a "marginal labor market phenomenon," the Cornell studies found that they benefit workers and employers by providing stability, job security and growth in job skills.

伦敦（CNN业务）骆驼，幸运罢工和颇尔购物中心卷烟的生产商正在尝试开发一种新产品：冠状病毒疫苗。
英美烟草公司BTAFF周三表示，其生物技术子公司肯塔基生物加工公司（Kentucky BioProcessing）正在研究一种潜在的新型冠状病毒疫苗，这种疫苗可以在与烟草密切相关的实验室种植的植物中生产。
疫苗的开发通常需要花费数年的时间，但是科学家和政府当局希望能够快速追踪这一过程，以防止病毒再次流行。
许多专家说，距离疫苗至少有18个月的时间，但其他专家警告说，即使是时间表也很乐观。
英美烟草公司说，它的潜在疫苗目前正在动物身上进行测试，并且正在“探索与政府机构的合作关系”以将这种疫苗用于临床研究。

London (CNN Business) The maker of Camel, Lucky Strike and Pall Mall cigarettes is trying its hand at a new product: a coronavirus vaccine.
British American Tobacco BTAFF said Wednesday that its biotech subsidiary, Kentucky BioProcessing, is working on a potential vaccine for the novel coronavirus that can be produced in lab-grown plants closely related to tobacco.
The development of vaccines typically takes years, but scientists and government authorities are hoping to fast-track the process to prevent a resurgence of the virus.
Many experts say a vaccine is at least 18 months away, but others caution that even that timetable is optimistic.
British American Tobacco said that its potential vaccine is currently being tested on animals, and it is "exploring partnerships with government agencies" to bring the vaccine to clinical studies.

由于菲律宾缺乏就业机会，护士通常不得不遵守法规。

According to World Health Organization guidelines, medical staff treating coronavirus patients should wear gloves, medical masks, goggles or a face shield, and body-covering gowns.
Due to the lack of employment opportunities in the Philippines, nurses are often faced with no option but to comply.
We don't see the enemy, and the health workers are the first ones that will be infected," she said.
People know that Abrias monitors potential coronavirus patients and are worried she will carry the virus from village to village.

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
后来空袭被认为是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

## 木摩天大楼革命终于到来了吗？

### Has the wooden skyscraper revolution finally arrived?

Mjøstårnet的高度达到280英尺，于去年开放后成为世界上最高的木材建筑。
长期倡导和设计木制建筑的建筑师Michael Green表示，“现在有很多东西在融合。”
Or Framework是位于俄勒冈州波特兰的一座雄心勃勃的148英尺高的木塔，在去年因成本担忧而被取消之前，该塔被设定为美国最高的木塔。
考虑到在2018年之前，俄勒冈州成为美国第一个允许使用18层木制建筑的州，而在美国，没有任何地方允许任何超过6层的建筑物，这一决定意义重大。
该组织表示，除了担心森林砍伐外，洒水喷头不能有效防止烈焰扩散到木结构建筑中。

Reaching 280 feet in height, Mjøstårnet became the world's tallest timber building upon opening last year.
According to architect Michael Green, a longstanding advocate for -- and designer of -- wooden buildings, there are "a whole bunch of things converging right now."
Or Framework, an ambitious 148-foot-tall timber tower in Portland, Oregon, that was set to be the USA's tallest wooden tower before was canceled amid cost concerns last year.
The decision is significant given that, before 2018, when Oregon became the first US state to allow 18-story wooden buildings, nowhere in America permitted anything higher than six.
In addition to concerns about deforestation, the group says sprinklers are ineffective at preventing blazes from spreading through wood buildings.
