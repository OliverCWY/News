世界卫生组织（世卫组织）的一个顾问小组将处理这个关键问题。
该小组正在就是否可以进一步预测该病毒的问题进行研究。美国的一项研究表明，咳嗽可达到600万，打喷嚏可达800万。
小组主席戴维·海曼（David Heymann）教授告诉英国广播公司（BBC），这项研究可能会导致有关口罩的建议发生变化。
该组织目前说，生病且有症状的人应该戴口罩，健康的人只有在照顾可能被感染的其他人或者自己咳嗽或打喷嚏时才需要戴口罩。

This key question is going to be taken up by a panel of advisers to the World Health Organization (WHO).
The group is weighing up research on whether the virus can be projected further than previously thought; a study in the US suggests coughs can reach 6m and sneezes up to 8m.
The panel's chair, Prof David Heymann, told the BBC that the research may lead to a shift in advice about masks.
Currently, the organisation says people who are sick and show symptoms should wear masks and says healthy people only need to wear them if they are caring for others suspected of being infected or if they themselves are coughing or sneezing.

她的同事兼朋友加文·丘奇亚德（Gavin Churchyard）告诉英国广播公司：“她毕生致力于为女性提供预防HIV的解决方案。”
南非是世界上感染艾滋病毒的人数最多的国家。
丘奇亚德教授说，拉姆吉教授将被深深怀念：“拥有一名国际公认的通行证的非洲科学家，确实给我们留下了巨大的空白。
“作为一名顽强的战士，她在与艾滋病毒，结核病和现在的Covid-19斗争中毫不懈怠。

"She dedicated many years of her life to finding HIV prevention solutions for women," her colleague and friend Gavin Churchyard told the BBC.
South Africa has the largest number of people living with HIV in the world.
Prof Churchyard said Prof Ramjee would be greatly missed: "To have an African scientist, who is internationally recognised pass - really leaves a huge void for us.
"As an unrelenting fighter, unrelenting in her fight against HIV, against tuberculosis and now Covid-19.

CSIRO科学家正在测试两种疫苗选择澳大利亚科学家已经开始在“里程碑”实验室试验中测试两种潜在的冠状病毒疫苗。
由牛津大学和美国公司Inovio Pharmaceutical生产的疫苗已被世界卫生组织批准用于动物试验。
上个月在美国进行了首次人体试验，但跳过了动物试验阶段。
科学家们说，动物实验的第一个结果可能最早在六月公布。
例如，牛津大学的疫苗也正在由另一家实验室对另一只动物进行测试，以符合美国法规。

The vaccines, made by Oxford University and US company Inovio Pharmaceutical, have been cleared for animal testing by the World Health Organization.
The first human trial took place in the US last month, but skipped a stage of animal testing.
The first results from the animal tests could be revealed as early as June, the scientists said.
The Oxford University vaccine, for example, is also being tested by another lab on a separate animal to comply with US regulations.

约翰·霍普金斯大学说，纽约是美国受灾最严重的地方。美国冠状病毒大流行造成的死亡人数已超过5,000。
同时，《华盛顿邮报》表示，联邦政府的防护设备和医疗用品储备几乎已用尽。
约翰·霍普金斯（Johns Hopkins）周三晚间报道，美国的死亡人数超过了5,100，并且还在继续上升。
在康涅狄格州，一个六周大的婴儿死于Covid-19，据信是迄今为止美国最年轻的病毒受害者。
美国官员说，即使采取了缓解措施，也可能有多达24万人死于这种疾病。

Meanwhile, the Washington Post said the federal government's reserves of protective equipment and medical supplies were almost exhausted.
The death toll in the US exceeded 5,100 and was continuing to rise, Johns Hopkins reported late on Wednesday.
In Connecticut, a six-week-old baby has died from Covid-19, believed to be America's youngest victim of the virus so far.
US officials say that as many as 240,000 people could die from the disease - even with the mitigation measures in place.

当前的指南说，口罩只需要医护人员，病人和照顾他们的人戴上。
目前，美国N95和手术口罩短缺，医护人员说他们被告知要多次重复使用口罩，或者在面罩不可用时使用头巾。
关于第二点，卫生专家之间存在争议-口罩在公众使用时是否有效。
福西博士说：“如果每个人都戴口罩，那么需要口罩的医护人员可能没有戴口罩。”
但是，他补充说：“如果您有足够的口罩……我们可能需要修改人们是否应该戴口罩的立场。”

Current guidelines say that masks only need to be worn by healthcare workers, the sick, and those caring for them.
There is currently a shortage of N95 and surgical masks in the US, with healthcare workers saying they have been told to reuse masks several times, or use bandanas when masks are not available.
There is debate amongst health experts on the second point - whether masks are effective when used by the public.
Dr Fauci said: "If everyone wears masks then healthcare workers who need them may not get them."
But, he added, "If you have enough masks… we may need to modify the stance on whether people should be wearing masks."

如果没有这些信息，公共卫生官员实际上就处于盲目状态，不知道下一个病毒热点将在何处爆发。
他的公共卫生顾问紧随其后发表了图表，预测即使在目前的缓解措施下，至少有10万美国人会死于该病毒。
目前，公共卫生政策的目标是在这一天到来之前限制病毒对人口造成的损失。
卫生官员说，与纽约市一样，美国大部分主要都会地区将遭受重创。
他说：“我们在美国存在的问题是，由于愿意投资公共卫生，应对能力在各个州之间差异很大。”

Without this information, public health officials are essentially flying blind, not knowing where the next viral hotspot will flare up.
His public health advisers followed that statement up with charts predicting at least 100,000 American deaths from the virus even under the current mitigating efforts.
The goal of public health policy for now is to limit the toll the virus takes on the population until that day arrives.
Health officials say most major US metropolitan areas were going to be hit has hard as New York City has been.
"The problem we have in the US," he says, " is the capacity to respond varies so dramatically on a state-by-state basis because of the willingness to invest in public health."

图片版权Getty Images英国航空公司预计将宣布将暂停约36,000名员工。
该航空公司由于冠状病毒危机而停飞了大部分机队，已经与联合工会进行了超过一个星期的谈判。
该协议意味着，多达80％的BA机舱乘务员，地勤人员，工程师和总公司人员将被停职，但预计不会裁减任何员工。
独立航空分析师约翰·斯特里克兰德（John Strickland）表示，英航与联合工会之间的“艰难谈判”意味着达成协议已经花了一段时间。
人们认为，团结工会一直在要求给员工更高的薪水。

The airline, which grounded much of its fleet due to the coronavirus crisis, has been negotiating with the Unite union for more than a week.
The agreement means that up to 80% of BA cabin crew, ground staff, engineers and those working at head office will have their jobs suspended but no staff are expected to be made redundant.
John Strickland, independent aviation analyst, said "tough negotiations" between BA and the Unite union meant it had taken a while to reach an agreement.
It is thought that the Unite union has been pushing for staff to be paid more than that.

特朗普称其为“ ra”的美国石油业，刚刚见证了油价暴跌的第一笔股市交易伤亡。
根据研究公司Rystad Energy的数据，本月全球原油需求预计将比一年前下降近23％。
据《华尔街日报》报道，他们将讨论一系列选择，其中可能包括对从沙特阿拉伯进口的石油征收关税的可能性。

夏尔马表示：“如果任何一家银行不公平地拒绝资金困难的好生意，那将是完全不可接受的。”
他说：“我们不可能遇到成功的小公司与银行接触而放贷人提供照常营业的情况。”
对于因冠状病毒关闭而面临现金流量危机的企业，美国财政部正准备修改其紧急贷款计划的规则。
“太多的小企业报告称拖延时间长，利率高，并被要求提供个人担保。”
“我们真正需要看到的是财政部正在听企业和银行所说的话，以使这些贷款的分散更加容易。”

"It would be completely unacceptable if any banks were unfairly refusing funds to good businesses in financial difficulty," Mr Sharma said.
"We can't have a situation where banks are approached by successful small firms and lenders offer up business as usual products," he said.
The Treasury is preparing to change the rules that govern its emergency loans scheme for businesses facing a cash-flow crisis because of the coronavirus shutdown.
"Too many small businesses report long delays, high interest terms and being asked for personal guarantees."
"What we really need to see is the Treasury listening to what businesses and banks are saying to make it easier for these loans to be dispersed."

``服务压力''通用信贷是针对工作年龄者的合并每月付款，取代了以前的许多福利，包括基于收入的求职者津贴，住房津贴，儿童税收抵免和工作税收抵免。
在2019年10月，有260万通用信用索赔人-超过三分之一在工作。
工党已敦促部长们走得更远，他们说应加快对新索赔人的核实程序，而不必偿还预付的现金（可用于迫切需要的人）。

'Pressure on services'Universal credit is a consolidated monthly payment for those of working-age, which replaced a host of previous benefits including income-based jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit, child tax credit and working tax credit.
In October 2019, there were 2.6 million universal credit claimants - just over a third of whom were in work.
Labour has urged ministers to go much further, saying the verification process for new claimants should be speeded up and upfront cash advances - available for those in urgent need - should not have to be repaid.
"People need help now," said shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood.

在这些奇怪的日子里，社交媒体上流露出一种轻松的情绪：“不要给您的前任发短信”。
新的HBO系列Run正是利用这种普遍的神经症-充满幽默感和情感力量。
（也许更令人惊讶的是，她在《 Run》中饰演的客串是中西部动物标本剥制者和好撒玛利亚人。）
Run确实的确以ex的文字开头。
Run是她才华横溢的真正工具，这在一定程度上吸引了她的注意力，展示了她的多维才能。

In these strange days, one light-hearted refrain has rung out across social media: “don’t text your ex”.
It is this universal neurosis that new HBO series Run taps into – with both comic nuance and emotional force.
(Though more surprising perhaps is her acting cameo in Run as a Midwestern taxidermist and good Samaritan).
Run does indeed begin with a text from an ex.
Run is a real vehicle for her talents, which gives her the spotlight in a part that showcases her gift for multi-dimensionality.

1941年9月8日，纳粹部队从西部和南部，并通过芬兰向北部包围了列宁格勒。
这是列宁格勒被围困的开始，这是历史上损失惨重的生命。
随着人口的饥饿，人们闻所未闻地谋求配给卡和吃尸体的情况并非鲜见。
尽管人们处于绝望的境地，但如果您知道在哪里寻找食物，仍然有一种食物来源没有被改变。
要了解这一点，我们需要问什么使食物变质。

On 8 September 1941, Nazi forces surrounded Leningrad from the west and south, and through Finland to the north.
This was the beginning of the Siege of Leningrad, the costliest in terms of lives lost in history.
As the population starved, it was not unheard of for people to murder for ration cards and eat corpses.
Despite people’s desperate condition, there was one source of food that remained untouched if you knew where to look.
To understand that, we need to ask what makes food go off.

艾琳·格雷（Eileen Gray）是一位神话般的迷人人物，位于20世纪20年代咆哮的巴黎美女世界的震中。
正如皮蒂（Pitiot）所说：“为她设计建筑是一种旅程，是其居民身心的陪伴。
通过她的建筑建议，她试图在景观，空间，家具，身体和灵魂之间实现一种共生形式。
这样，艾琳·格雷的建筑就可以呼吸，并为居民提供了一个可以休息的空间，身体和灵魂都可以休息。 ，每个对象都被归入一个神秘而又活泼的统一体。
艾琳·格雷（Eileen Gray）的故事实际上就是取回的故事。

Eileen Gray was a fabulously glamorous figure, at the epicentre of the Parisian beau monde of the Roaring ’20s.
As Pitiot puts it: “Architecture for her is a form of journey, an accompaniment for the body and mind of its inhabitant.
Through her architectural proposals, she sought to achieve a form of symbiosis between the landscape, space, furniture, body, and soul.
In this way, Eileen Gray’s architecture breathes and offers the inhabitant an open space where both body and soul can rest.”Badovici himself wrote in 1924 in l’Architecture Vivante, that Gray’s designs revealed “an atmosphere of boundless plasticity, where different perspectives meld, where each object is subsumed into a mysterious, living unity.
And the story of Eileen Gray is really the story of retrieval.

同样重要的是，心脏周围动脉中的压力敏感压力感受器会进入迷走神经。
在长时间的呼气过程中，通过反复刺激迷走神经，缓慢的呼吸可使神经系统朝着更加宁静的状态转变，从而导致积极的变化，例如心率降低和血压降低。
（要了解迷走神经及其在关节炎，糖尿病和心血管疾病等疾病中的作用的更多信息，请阅读Gaia Vince在Mosaic上发表的深入文章，或听她的广播纪录片。）
也许这些做法是通过无意识地意识到这种恢复性呼吸节奏及其将人们带入轻松但专注的精神状态的能力而发展起来的。
这可能是由于呼吸缓慢带来的心理舒适性以及对疼痛敏感性的任何直接生理变化。

Just as importantly, the pressure-sensitive baroreceptors, in the arteries around the heart, feed into the vagus nerve.
By repeatedly stimulating the vagus nerve during those long exhalations, slow breathing may shift the nervous system towards that more restful state, resulting in positive changes like a lower heart rate and lower blood pressure.
(To find out more about the vagus nerve and its role in conditions like arthritis, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, read Gaia Vince’s in-depth article at Mosaic, or listen to her radio documentary.)
Perhaps those practices evolved through an unconscious recognition of this restorative breathing rhythm and its capacity to send people into a relaxed but focused state of mind.
This may be due to the psychological comfort that comes from slow breathing, as much as any direct physiological changes to the pain sensitivity.
