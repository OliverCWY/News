Pause, then think

Perhaps the biggest challenge faced by a decision-maker is when to make decisions. Make them too slowly and events overtake you; too quickly and you risk acting rashly.

“In stressful situations people often behave as if they’re under time pressure, even when they’re not,” says Professor Emma Barrett of The University of Manchester, who specialises in the psychology of extreme environments. Her collaborator Dr Nathan Smith agrees: “We’ve interviewed people who are experienced at coping in all sorts of extreme environments and asked them how they make decisions when a military operation goes wrong or there’s an avalanche at high altitude. Nearly all of them said that often you’ve got more time than you think – time to take a step back and just reflect for a few moments, so that your emotions aren’t driving the decision.”

Barrett recalls the Kegworth air disaster from 1989, when a passenger flight crashed on to a motorway embankment in Leicestershire in the UK. After it became clear that one of the two engines was malfunctioning, the pilot moved quickly to shut it down, but mistakenly switched off the only functioning engine. "He took a quick decision in response to danger cues when in fact he had a bit more time to establish which engine was faulty," says Barrett.

Related to this is the tendency for people in highly stressful situations to focus their attention so tightly on the decision in front of them that they miss vital new information, a phenomenon called ‘cognitive tunnelling’. The pilot of Air France 447, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009, had become so fixated on levelling the wings of the aeroplane during turbulence that he failed to notice the aeroplane going into a dangerously steep ascent. This stalled the engines, sending the plane into a dive. Even as the alarm system blared ‘STALL’, the pilot did not comprehend what was happening.
