Copenhagen (CNN) This week, as younger children across Denmark walked onto school grounds, school bags on their backs and holding parents by the hand, things seemed almost normal. Almost.

Jimmy Skov Glasdam Adetunji, head of secondary education at the Hendriksholm School in Rodovre, just outside Copenhagen, spent Wednesday going through classrooms with a measuring stick to ensure the 440 students could be seated at least two meters (six feet) apart when they arrived on Thursday.

He had split the schoolyard into six sections with red and white barrier tape, and sent a detailed diagram to parents outlining staggered arrival times, routes, breaks and lunch times.

"I can't wait to see the kids again," Adetunji said. "But we will obviously have to talk about the pandemic and the rules and why our playground is now marked by police tape. So, it's going to be a contrast between fun and seriousness."

School children have their lunch break at the Korshoejskolen public school in Randers, Denmark, on April 15.

A few miles away, in Bronshoj, Philip Mundt was dropping his six-year old son Emil for his first day back. "He is so excited," Philip said, laughing. "All the way here, he's been talking about how he's going to see his friends and that this is the best day of his life. He is really looking forward to this."
