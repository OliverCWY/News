(CNN) Last time Jessica Meir, Andrew Morgan and Oleg Skripochka were on Earth, there were house parties, happy hours, handshakes, crowded concerts and no one was yet talking about the novel coronavirus that has reshaped daily life across the world.

More than 200 days since they each embarked on their trip to space, things are different. All three astronauts landed Friday morning near Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan.

"Home safe and sound," NASA said in a tweet Friday morning. "Today's landing wraps up a 205-day mission for both @Astro_Jessica and Oleg Skripochka and a 272-day mission for @AstroDrewMorgan. Welcome home\!"

Friday also marks 50 years since astronauts aboard Apollo 13 were forced to abort their lunar landing mission -- after explosions crippled the service module and command module -- and safely landed in the Pacific Ocean.

It's an almost ironic parallel.
