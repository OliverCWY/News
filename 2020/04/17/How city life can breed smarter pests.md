Some thought they would be the Fort Knox of bins. Well, sort of. Resistant to marauding raccoons, or at least that was the hope. To residents of Toronto, Canada, raccoons are a familiar pest. The mammals adore rummaging through household waste, seeking out scraps of food. But a few years ago, the city launched new rubbish bins with securely locking lids.

And yet, the wiliest raccoons still found a way to get inside them. Video captured by a reporter at local newspaper The Star shows one of the animals tipping over a bin, and – impressively – turning the handle lock on the lid to gain access to the contents.

Before the bins were deployed, they were tested with “dozens and dozens” of raccoons by Suzanne MacDonald at York University, Toronto, who studies the animals. None ever managed to break in so she was surprised when she saw that the bins could, in fact, be breached.

“Only a few raccoons have figured out how to break into the bins,” she says, two years later. “I can’t imagine how they would be modified, frankly, because some raccoons will always figure out how to break things.”

It raises a question, though. Do the secure locks, traps and barriers we use to keep so-called pests at bay actually prompt them to learn or evolve in order to outwit such measures? We already know that, in trying to poison urban rats, we are encouraging them to develop resistance to those same chemicals. Could the same thing be happening with the intelligence, or cognitive prowess, of pests?

The first thing to note, says MacDonald, is that Toronto’s raccoons are not dependent on cracking into the locked bins for food, so there is no selection pressure prioritising the survival of the raccoons that know how to bust open a bin. Plus, she adds that raccoons are not social learners, so the raiders of the locked bins won’t have taught others how they did it.
