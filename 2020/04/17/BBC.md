法新社版权：法新社肯尼亚非政府组织工作人员封锁了首都并实行宵禁图片说明：非政府组织肯尼亚非政府组织工作人员封锁了首都并实行宵禁自第一例冠状病毒病例以来，已经过去了两个多月在非洲得到证实。
南非目前是该地区爆发最严重的疫情，有2500多例。
世界卫生组织说，在大多数非洲国家中，每一百万人只有大约五个重症监护病床。
但是联合国机构说，仍然有时间来防止我们在非洲其他地方也看到的大规模爆发。
但这是一种崭新的病毒，需要为非洲提供适当的资源以抗击它。

South Africa currently has the most severe outbreak in the region, with more than 2,500 cases.
The World Health Organization says there are only around five intensive care beds available for every one million people in most African countries.
But the UN agency says there is still time to prevent the massive outbreaks we have seen elsewhere unfolding in Africa too.
But this is a brand new virus, and Africa needs to be properly resourced in order to fight it.

卫生部表示，它正在“全天候”提供必要的防护设备。
NHS信托理事长在周三告诉BBC：“我们不缺少PPE的官方说法是幻想。”
本周泄露的英国公共卫生文件建议卫生工作者仅在“不得已时”再使用防护服和口罩。
NHS使用的几乎所有英国礼服都在中国和远东制造。
发言人说，到目前为止，已经有近十亿件防护设备运抵了第一线。

The Department of Health said it was working "around the clock" to provide protective equipment where needed.
And on Wednesday the NHS trust director told the BBC: "The official line that we don't have a shortage of PPE is fantasy."
A leaked Public Health England document this week advised health workers to reuse protective gowns and masks only as a "last resort".
Almost all of the UK's gowns used by the NHS are made in China and the Far East.
Nearly one billion pieces of protective equipment had been delivered to the frontline so far, the spokesman said.

美国国务院的电报显示，使馆官员担心中国武汉病毒实验室的生物安全性。
实验室位于首次出现冠状病毒爆发的城市。
它还声称外交官担心实验室对蝙蝠冠状病毒的研究可能会冒新的类似Sars的大流行危险。
一月份在网上传播的一种在线理论认为，该病毒可能是在实验室中作为生物武器进行工程改造的。
还有人指控实验室意外释放了天然病毒。

The lab is in the same city where the coronavirus outbreak first came to the world's attention.
It also claims diplomats were concerned the lab's research on bat coronaviruses could risk a new Sars-like pandemic.
One online theory, that went viral in January, suggested the virus could have been engineered in a lab as a bioweapon.
Then there is the allegation of an accidental release of a natural virus from a lab.

暂停，然后思考也许决策者面临的最大挑战是何时制定决策。
让它们变得太慢，事件超越您。太快会冒着轻率行动的风险。
曼彻斯特大学（University of Manchester）的艾玛·巴雷特（Emma Barrett）教授专门研究极端环境的心理学原理，他说：“即使在压力很大的情况下，人们也会表现得好像受到时间的压力一样。”
她的合作者内森·史密斯（Nathan Smith）博士表示同意：“我们采访了在各种极端环境中都有经验的人，并询问他们在军事行动出错或在高海拔发生雪崩时如何做出决定。
与此相关的是，处于高度压力状态的人们倾向于将注意力集中在他们面前的决策上，以至于他们错过了重要的新信息，这种现象被称为“认知隧道效应”。

Pause, then thinkPerhaps the biggest challenge faced by a decision-maker is when to make decisions.
Make them too slowly and events overtake you; too quickly and you risk acting rashly.
“In stressful situations people often behave as if they’re under time pressure, even when they’re not,” says Professor Emma Barrett of The University of Manchester, who specialises in the psychology of extreme environments.
Her collaborator Dr Nathan Smith agrees: “We’ve interviewed people who are experienced at coping in all sorts of extreme environments and asked them how they make decisions when a military operation goes wrong or there’s an avalanche at high altitude.
Related to this is the tendency for people in highly stressful situations to focus their attention so tightly on the decision in front of them that they miss vital new information, a phenomenon called ‘cognitive tunnelling’.

因此，如何制作正宗的那不勒斯披萨，特别是对于那些不能去那不勒斯吃那不勒斯的人而言？
那不勒斯的披萨只使用两种类型的马苏里拉奶酪：用牛奶制成的菲奥蒂拿铁；或莫扎里拉di bufala，由生活在该国坎帕尼亚和拉齐奥地区的水牛乳制成。
家庭挑战真正的那不勒斯比萨协会正在举办一个免费竞赛，名为\#VeraPizzaContest，面向比萨制作者（业余爱好者和专业人士），以了解谁制作和设计出最出色的比萨。

Naples is, of course, the hub of the pizza napoletana (Neapolitan pizza), with generations of the same family groomed in the art of being a pizzaiolo (pizzamaker).
The colours of the Italian flag were mirrored in the ingredients: tomatoes for red; cheese for white; and basil for green.
It’s [how you make] the dough that’s essentialSo, how does one make an authentic Neapolitan pizza, especially for those who can’t go to Naples to eat one?
Only two types of mozzarella are used for Neapolitan pizza: fior di latte made from cow’s milk; or mozzarella di bufala, made from the milk of the water buffalo that live in the country’s Campania and Lazio regions.
A home challenge The True Neapolitan Pizza Association is holding a free contest called \#VeraPizzaContest for pizza makers (amateur and professionals alike) to see who makes the best pizza designed and made at home.

在此期间，史密斯菲尔德（Smithfield）员工中确诊病例的数量从80上升到190到238缓慢上升。
约有550个独立农场将猪运往苏福尔斯工厂。
但是根据史密斯菲尔德的员工，工会代表和苏福尔斯移民社区的拥护者所说，导致工厂关闭的爆发是可以避免的。
在海伦（Helen）收到结果的同一天，史密斯菲尔德（Smithfield）工厂的问题完全变成了政治问题。

By "Smithfield", she was referring to the Smithfield Foods pork-processing plant located in her town of Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
During that time, the number of confirmed cases among Smithfield employees slowly mounted, from 80 to 190 to 238.
About 550 independent farms send their pigs to the Sioux Falls plant.
But according to Smithfield employees, their union representatives, and advocates for the immigrant community in Sioux Falls, the outbreak that led to the plant closure was avoidable.
On the same day that Helen received her results, the issue of the Smithfield plant had turned fully political.

它抹去了去年年底最新一组数据所记录的中国经济6％的增长。

But the slowdown in the rest of the global economy presents a significant problem as exports still play a major role in China's economy.
On Thursday the International Monetary Fund forecast China's economy would avoid a recession but grow by just 1.2% this year.

Risk to recoveryOn top of all of those challenges, new coronavirus cases and re-infections are risking China's tepid economy recovery.

Last month, the European Commission issued guidelines to ensure a strong EU-wide approach to foreign investment screening "in a time of public health crisis and related economic vulnerability".
The UK formally left the EU on 31 January, but is currently in a transition period until the end of the year.

美国上个月批准了前所未有的3490亿美元减免，目的是帮助小型企业克服冠状病毒的封锁。
根据商会和其他组织的调查，多达四分之一的小型企业担心他们将无法生存超过两个月的停业。
这样的失败将极大地改变美国的经济格局，那里有3000万小企业雇用了该国几乎一半的劳动力。
该组织总裁帕特里斯·弗雷（Patrice Frey）表示：“小型企业真的对政府将能够在这场危机中提供支持的信心丧失了。”
小型企业管理局（Small Business Administration）说，超过160万笔贷款申请被批准，总额超过3390亿美元。

America approved an unprecedented $349bn in relief last month aimed at helping small firms through the coronavirus lockdowns.
'Losing faith'As many as a quarter of small businesses fear they will not be able to survive more than two months of shutdown, according to surveys by the Chamber of Commerce and other organisations.
Such failures would dramatically alter the economic landscape in America, where 30 million small businesses employ almost half the country's workforce.
"Small businesses are really losing faith that the government is going to be able to support them through this crisis," says Patrice Frey, the organisation's president.
More than 1.6 million loan applications were approved for more than $339bn, the Small Business Administration said.

您可能还会喜欢：“两年后，只有少数浣熊想出了如何闯入垃圾箱的方法。”
害虫的智力或认知能力是否会发生同样的事情？
此外，她还补充说，浣熊不是社交学习者，因此对带锁垃圾箱的袭击者不会教别人如何做。

But a few years ago, the city launched new rubbish bins with securely locking lids.
Before the bins were deployed, they were tested with “dozens and dozens” of raccoons by Suzanne MacDonald at York University, Toronto, who studies the animals.
You might also like:“Only a few raccoons have figured out how to break into the bins,” she says, two years later.
Could the same thing be happening with the intelligence, or cognitive prowess, of pests?
Plus, she adds that raccoons are not social learners, so the raiders of the locked bins won’t have taught others how they did it.

在使迪克·卡维特（Dick Cavett）成为脱口秀主持人的所有其他事情中，最引人注目的也许是美国总统理查德·尼克松（Richard Nixon）被录音带讨论如何毁掉他。
如果您想问我如何开始爱上Dick Cavett表演，这是一部1970年代的美国时间胶囊，里面有您可以想象到的所有关于女性解放的羊肉和小品，我很难确定确切的时间。
迪克·卡维特（Dick Cavett）的演出始于1968年，当时是美国广播公司（ABC），后来是1975年转为哥伦比亚广播公司（CBS），然后直接通过80年代的各种网络播出。
一直以来，Cavett都在主持，聚会和谦逊的主持会议上发挥了作用，这些聚会具有巴黎老派沙龙的学术气息。
迪克·卡维特（Dick Cavett）表演处于鼎盛时期时，我还活着。

Of all the things that mark out Dick Cavett as a talk show host like few others, perhaps the most notable is that US President Richard Nixon was caught on tape discussing how to ruin him.
If you were to ask me how I first grew to love the Dick Cavett Show, a time capsule of 1970s Americana with all the mutton chops and quips about women’s lib you can imagine, it’d be difficult for me to pinpoint exactly when.
The Dick Cavett show started in 1968 on ABC, moving to CBS in 1975 and then on various networks straight through the ‘80s.
All the while, Cavett facilitates, wry and unassuming, chairing gatherings that have the intellectual air of an old-school Parisian salon.
I wasn’t alive when The Dick Cavett Show was in its heyday.

Yet his wartime letters overflowed with youthful idealism and love-sick hopes for the future:“I love you so much that I’m really tied up.
Some day if all my dreams come true I’ll want to ask you to be my wife.”Writing wartime letters wasn’t particular to World War Two.
Mail call whenever it happened it was a delight.”By writing letters, you take the time to step back and thinkMy grandfather’s wartime letters have inspired me to write letters of my own.

您可能已经注意到您的一些同事是如何担任领导角色的，如水落石出。
对于其他人而言，情况无异于：在周围的人处处处感到尴尬，and琐的自我怀疑掩盖了每个决定。
如果您属于后一组，您可能会想知道为什么要成为领导者会让您感到恐惧，以及为什么觉得自己很难成为经理。
如果您的父母使紫罗兰萎缩，那么您也同样会增加几率。
关键是父母对您的举止。

You’ve probably noticed how some of your colleagues take to leadership roles like a duck to water.
It couldn’t be more different for others: bossing around people feels awkward, and a nagging self-doubt shadows every decision.
If you’re in the latter group, you might wonder why the thought of being a leader fills you with dread, and why you find it so hard to even see yourself as a manager.
If your parents were shrinking violets, the odds are increased that you will be too.
And key here is the way your parents behaved toward you.

另一方面，丹尼尔（Daniel）用自传正面的照片烤制了一个看起来像阿尔登女士的棒棒糖蛋糕。
正如成品的图像所示，这块蛋糕对Ardern女士来说几乎不是死了的铃声。
“我很抱歉杰辛达·阿登，”丹尼尔写道。
星期四，阿尔登女士（Ardern）表示该国正在接近一个可以解除生活限制的职位。
阿德恩女士说：“有迹象表明，我们的一劳永逸的消灭策略正在奏效，封锁行动正在打破社区传播的链条。”

Daniel, on the other hand, baked a lolly cake supposed to look like Ms Ardern, using a picture on the front of her autobiography for inspiration.
As images of the finished article show, the cake was hardly a dead ringer for Ms Ardern.
"I’m deeply sorry Jacinda Ardern," Daniel wrote.
On Thursday, Ms Ardern signalled the country was approaching a position where she may be able to lift some restrictions on life.
"There are promising signs our go-hard-and-go-early elimination strategy is working and the lockdown is breaking the chain of community transmission," Ms Ardern said.

这是主要的社交媒体平台首次在全球范围内阻止青少年的私人消息传递。
英国监管机构Ofcom进行的一项调查显示，去年12至15岁的年轻人中有13％使用了TikTok。
“大胆”直到现在，当两个帐户彼此关注时，所有用户都可以向其他人发送直接消息。
TikTok表示，受影响的人将很快收到应用内通知，并将在4月30日失去访问直接消息的权限。
“此外，阻止使用其最大子用户群之间的消息传递等核心功能也是大胆的举动。”

It is the first time a major social-media platform has blocked private messaging by teenagers, on a global scale.
A survey by UK regulator Ofcom suggested TikTok was used by 13% of 12- to 15-year-olds last year.
'Bold move'Until now, all users have been able to send direct messages to others, when both accounts follow each other.
TikTok says those affected will receive an in-app notification soon and will lose access to direct messages on 30 April.
"Also, blocking use of a core feature such as messaging between its biggest sub-set of users is bold move."

装修经常需要为洗衣机，滚筒式干衣机和晾衣架找到新家，以腾出厨房空间。
在某些房屋中，您可以在曾经有锅炉系统的空间中创建一个橱柜或小房间。
或者一个完美的地方在楼梯下。
这个方便的空间可用于将您想要的那些物品放在容易拿到但看不到的地方。
而且，如果您想溅水，甚至可以包括一个除湿机（当然要塞进去）。

Renovations often require finding a new home for your washing machine, tumble dryer and clothes airer to free up space in the kitchen.
In some houses you can create a cupboard or small room in the space where there used to be a boiler system.
Or a perfect spot is under the stairs.
This handy space can be used to keep those items that you want within easy reach but out of sight.
And if you feel like splashing out you can even include a dehumidifier (plumbed in of course).
