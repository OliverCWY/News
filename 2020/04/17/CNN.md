上周末，土耳其政府对31个省实施了48小时宵禁，影响了土耳其四分之三的人口。
面对冠状病毒，土耳其正在制定自己的道路-就像在许多其他方面一样。
实施为期两天的宵禁以阻止冠状病毒在伊斯坦布尔蔓延后，鸽子在空无一人的塔克西姆广场上飞来飞去。
Koca说，与其他国家不同，土耳其对抗Covid-19的方法围绕接触者追踪而不是常规测试或临床演示后的测试。
她能否真正看到它们有多快取决于土耳其的Covid-19战略是否是一次成功的赌博。

Last weekend, the Turkish government implemented a 48-hour curfew for 31 provinces, impacting three quarters of Turkey's population.
In confronting coronavirus, Turkey is charting its own path -- as it does in so many other ways.
Pigeons fly around a deserted Taksim Square after a two-day curfew imposed to stem the spread of coronavirus in Istanbul.
Koca says that, unlike other countries, Turkey's approach to fighting Covid-19 centers around contact tracing instead of general testing or testing after clinical presentation.
How soon she can actually see them will depend on whether or not Turkey's Covid-19 strategy is a successful gamble.

（CNN）中国已经修改了新型冠状病毒的官方死亡人数，使大流行造成的死亡人数增加了三分之一以上。
武汉的官员于去年底首次报告该病毒，上周五，该市的死亡人数增加了1,290人。
目前，该市记录的病例总数为50,333，死亡3,869。
之前报告的武汉市死亡人数是2579-修订后的数字表明，该市死于冠状病毒的人数增加了50％。
截至4月17日，中国国家卫生委员会已在全国报告了3,342例死亡病例，此前公布了经修订的武汉市统计数字。

(CNN) China has revised its official death toll from the novel coronavirus, raising the number of fatalities attributed to the pandemic by more than a third.
Officials in Wuhan, where the virus was first reported late last year, on Friday added 1,290 coronavirus deaths to the city's toll.
The total number of cases recorded in the city now stands at 50,333, with 3,869 deaths.
The previous reported death toll for Wuhan was 2,579 -- so the revised figure marks a 50% increase in the number of deaths in the city from coronavirus.
As of April 17, China's National Health Commission had reported 3,342 deaths nationally , before the revised Wuhan figures were published.

伦敦（CNN）冠状病毒的旅行限制已导致英国农业部门的劳工危机，而英国农业部门传统上依靠季节性的欧洲移民工人，迫使一些雇主将工人带上包机。
人们担心，冠状病毒危机是英国脱欧可能带来的困难的预兆。
所谓的低技能，低薪工人没有任何途径。相反，政府表示将扩大其季节性工人签证计划，以每年增加一万人。
对该计划的批评者表示，它将排除某些等级的护士和几乎所有护理人员，这些部门依赖强大的移民劳动力。
他说：“这是对没有获得低技能移民劳动力的情况的一种体验。”

London (CNN) Coronavirus travel restrictions have led to a labor crisis for British agricultural sectors that traditionally rely on seasonal migrant workers from Europe, forcing some employers to bring workers in on charter flights.
There are fears that the coronavirus crisis is a foretaste of difficulties that could flow from Brexit.
There was no pathway for so-called lower-skilled , lower paid workers; instead, the government said it would expands its seasonal workers visa scheme to bring in 10,000 people a year.
Critics of the plan said it would exclude some grades of nurses and almost all care workers, sectors that depend on a strong migrant labor force.
"It's a taste of what happens without access to low-skilled migrant labor," he said.

冠状病毒在中国大陆及其邻国迅速传播，在韩国，香港，日本及其他地区均报告了病例。
后来在欧洲和美国出现的中国内部并没有这种迅速的传播。
“在香港，我们受理了所有这些案件，然后我们检查了他们的联系方式，似乎没有那么传染性。

Hong Kong (CNN) At the beginning of the year, parts of east Asia were a somewhat scary place to be.
The coronavirus was spreading rapidly across mainland China and its neighbors, with cases reported in South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan and beyond.
And there was not the kind of rapid spread inside China that later came in Europe and the US.
"In Hong Kong, we picked up all these cases, and then we checked their contacts, and it didn't seem to be that contagious.
They would continue to roll out new measures in the weeks that followed, which have been successful in containing the virus' spread on the island.

ICE发言人星期四对CNN表示：“ ICE拘留中被拘留者的健康和福利是该机构的重中之重。
目前，CDC在危地马拉开展工作，以审查和验证对从ICE Air航班抵达的航班进行的Covid-19测试。
一旦获得结果，ICE将决定是否在疾病预防控制中心的指导下对现有医疗程序进行重新评估，以确保实施任何新的必要做法。”

An ICE spokesperson told CNN Thursday that "the health and welfare of detainees in ICE custody is of the highest priority to the agency.
Currently, CDC is on the ground in Guatemala to review and validate the Covid-19 tests performed on those arriving from ICE Air flights.
Once results are available, ICE will determine whether to re-evaluate current medical procedures with CDC guidance to ensure that any newly necessary practices are implemented."

在其起源的军队之外，嗡嗡声削减长期以来一直是反文化的保留-反叛美学，授权和事件政治异议的象征。
的确，60年代后期的外观只是嗡嗡声。
但是剪短头发就像遵守古老而又庄重的社会规范。
好莱坞助推了这种形象：从《异形》中的西格妮·韦弗（Sigourney Weaver）到《 G.I Jane》中的黛米·摩尔（Demi Moore），发型成为了典型的坚强女人装。
布兰妮·斯皮尔斯（Britney Spear）在2007年臭名昭著的嗡嗡声削减中途走了一半。短暂的中断之后，嗡嗡声削减在2016年左右再次大受欢迎-想想克里斯汀·斯图尔特（Cristen Stewart）和卡拉·迪瓦伊（Cara Delevingne），罗伯特·帕丁森（Robert Pattinson）和尼克·乔纳斯（Nick Jonas）。

Outside of the army, where it originated, the buzz cut has long been the preserve of counterculture -- a symbol of rebellious aesthetics, empowerment, event political dissent.
Indeed, the late 60s look was anything but a buzz cut.
But to cut your hair short felt like conforming to old and staid social norms.
Hollywood helped fuel that image: from Sigourney Weaver in "Alien" to Demi Moore in "G.I Jane," the hair style became the quintessential tough woman trope.

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
后来空袭被认为是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

但是，美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）采访了包括帕特里夏（Patricia）在内的五名十几岁和二十多岁的女性，他们声称格拉瑟（Glaser）在Bery's Place对其进行了性和情感虐待。
当女孩们反对时，他们说格拉泽会威胁要把他们赶出去。
一些幸存者说，格拉瑟（Glaser）介绍自己是一名医生，但支持起诉的律师告诉美国有线电视新闻网（CNN），他是物理治疗师-不是合格的医生。
Dilen于去年2月在Bery's Place进行的一次警察突袭中因警察的讯问而被捕，后来被释放。
但至少现在，他们说他们开始在贝里故居之外享受生活。

But five women in their late teens and early twenties interviewed by CNN, including Patricia, allege that Glaser sexually and emotionally abused them at Bery's Place.
When the girls objected, they say Glaser would threaten to cast them out on the streets.
Some survivors say Glaser introduced himself as a doctor, but lawyers supporting the prosecution told CNN that he is a physiotherapist -- not a qualified physician.
Dilen was arrested for questioning by police last February during a police raid at Bery's Place, and later released.
But for now, at least, they say they're beginning to enjoy their lives outside of Bery's Place.

## 香港冠状病毒检疫营内的情况

### What it's like inside a Hong Kong coronavirus quarantine camp

假日营地变成了隔离营地-隔离饮食-温度检查和穿PPE的工作人员在隔离区生活-感觉就像在学校，营地和监狱中一样奇怪。
我的工厂位于鲤鱼门公园，通常是香港岛东部一个绿树成荫的度假村。
这个假日公园是香港用作冠状病毒检疫中心的几处设施之一。
在此之前，我已经在家工作了三个月-因此，在隔离营中做同样的事情并没有多大区别。
但这证明了香港政府对遏制从海外进口的案件并推回本地自满情绪的重视程度。

Holiday camp turned quarantine campLife in quarantine -- with its regimented meals, temperature checks and PPE-wearing staff -- feels like an odd mix of being in school, at camp, and in prison.
My facility, in Lei Yue Mun Park, is normally a leafy holiday village in the east of Hong Kong Island.
This holiday park is one of several facilities being used as coronavirus quarantine centers in Hong KongSince March, that number has surged.
Prior to now, I'd already been working from home for three months -- so doing the same from a quarantine camp hasn't made much of a difference.
But it's a testament to how serious the Hong Kong government is about clamping down on cases imported from overseas, and pushing back on local complacency.
