It looked like a golden roasted chicken drumstick. The smell wafting up from the plate in front of a dozen hungry senior citizens was of chicken too. When they dug in with their knives and forks, it even tasted loosely like one.

Except that it was not chicken at all. What this group of elderly nursing home residents in Germany were tucking into was puree, printed into the shape of a drumstick. Each “chicken leg” – actually formed from vegetable paste shaped by a 3D printer and given a more pleasurable texture than ordinary puree – was tweaked to match the nutritional needs of the individual elderly diners.

The group, who first ate this “not-chicken” meal in taste tests five years ago, were the participants of an innovative food project in Europe, named “Performance”, which explored whether 3D printed food could be delivered to elderly people with problems swallowing food, also known as dysphagia.

For many people with chewing and swallowing issues eating a chicken drumstick would normally be difficult. Currently, however, most foods created for elderly people with this problem tend to be unappetising and boring, which can often lead to them not getting the nutrition they need. But a number of research teams are now developing solutions that might allow older people to still enjoy a nutritious, varied and interesting diet in a format which is easy to eat.
