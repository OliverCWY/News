It celebrates the birthday of the country's founding father, Kim Il Sung, and has in the past been marked with events like satellite launches and massive military parades . The North Korean calendar even begins on April 15 and years are measured from the date of Kim's birth.

North Korean state media did not report his presence at Day of the Sun festivities on Wednesday. The country's state-run news agency, KCNA, reported that "senior officials" made the customary visit to Pyongyang's Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, the mausoleum where the bodies of Kim Il Sung and his successor and son, Kim Jong Il, are both on display.
