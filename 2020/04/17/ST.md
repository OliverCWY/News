北京（路透社）-由于冠状病毒的爆发瘫痪了生产和支出，中国经济在第一季度近三十年来首次出现萎缩，这给当局施加了压力，要求其采取更多措施阻止失业人数增加。
至少从1992年官方季度GDP记录开始以来，这种收缩还是世界第二大经济体的第一次收缩。
提供一线希望是3月份工厂生产下降的幅度小于预期，这表明自2月份以来重启部分经济体的努力正在奏效。
然而，在消费方面面临的挑战最为突出的是零售额下降了15.8％，大于预期。
流行病影响经济学家对第一季度GDP的预测差异很大，因为该流行病对中国的经济和社会影响存在许多不确定性。

BEIJING (REUTERS) - China's economy shrank for the first time in almost three decades of records in the first quarter, as the coronavirus outbreak paralysed production and spending, raising pressure on the authorities to do more to stop mounting job losses.
The contraction is also the first in the world’s second-largest economy since at least 1992 when official quarterly GDP records started.
Providing a silver lining was a much smaller-than-expected decline in factory production in March, suggesting efforts to restart parts of the economy since February are working.
Highlighting the challenges in consumption, however, was a 15.8 per cent fall in retail sales, which was larger than expected.
PANDEMIC IMPACTEconomists’ forecasts for first quarter GDP ranged widely, given the many uncertainties around the pandemic’s economic and social impact in China.

华盛顿—唐纳德·特朗普总统周四（4月16日）概述了联邦指导各州重新开放企业和缓解社会疏远规则的三个阶段，一天后，他说美国整体上已经超越了其冠状病毒案件的顶峰。
特朗普在周四的每日简报中说：“国家停业不是可持续的长期解决方案。
一些州将比其他州更早开放。”
特朗普先生说，过去七天，该国近30％的人未报告新病例。
专家们欢迎给予州的灵活性，因为本周早些时候担心特朗普会向州施加压力，要求其迅速重新开放。

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump on Thursday (April 16) outlined federal guidelines for states to reopen businesses and ease social distancing rules in three phases, a day after he said that the United States as a whole had made it past the peak of its coronavirus cases.
Said Mr Trump at his daily briefing on Thursday: “A national shutdown is not a sustainable long-term solution.
And some states will be able to open up sooner than others,” he added.
Mr Trump said that nearly 30 per cent of the country reported no new cases in the last seven days.
Experts welcomed the flexibility given to states, given worries earlier in the week that Mr Trump would pressure states to reopen quickly.

惠灵顿（路透社）-尽管周五（4月17日）冠状病毒病例数大幅下降，新西兰仍对其强硬的封锁政策进行了辩护，官员称有2例新的死亡事件作为过早解除社会限制的风险的证据。
该国仅报告了8例新的Covid-19病例，数周以来首次出现个位数增长，总数达到1,409。
作为新西兰“四级”禁闭措施的一部分，办公室，学校和酒吧，饭店，咖啡馆和游乐场等所有非必需服务已关闭了近一个月。
政府将于周一决定是否延长，解除或放松封锁。
罗伯逊先生说：“现在，在第4级或第3级水平上停留更长的时间，对经济而言，比早日退出并可能恢复锁定状态要好得多。”

WELLINGTON (REUTERS) - New Zealand justified its tough lockdown policies despite a significant drop in the number of coronavirus cases on Friday (April 17), with officials citing two new deaths as evidence of the risk from lifting social restrictions too soon.
The country reported just eight fresh Covid-19 cases, the first single digit increase in weeks, taking to the total to 1,409.
Offices, schools and all non-essential services like bars, restaurants, cafes and playgrounds have been closed for almost a month as part of New Zealand's "Level 4" lockdown.
The government is due to make a decision on whether to extend, lift or ease the lockdown on Monday.
"A little longer now on level 4 or level 3, is ultimately better for the economy than an early exit and potential return to lockdown," Mr Robertson said.

截止过去一个月，澳大利亚在关闭边界并实施严格的“社会隔离”措施之后，迄今避免了全世界报道的大量冠状病毒伤亡。
莫里森对3AW广播电台说：“社会疏远是我们应该习惯的事情。”
“当然，当病毒在全世界流行时（1.5米长的规则）应该是自然的本能。”
她补充说：“不幸的是，不幸的是学生们在家里可能面临长达一年甚至更长的时间，而我们不合适。”
该船被关押在悉尼以南的工业港口。

Australia has so far avoided the high numbers of coronavirus casualties reported around the world after closing its borders and imposing strict "social distancing" measures for the past month.
"Social distancing is something we should get very used to," Mr Morrison told radio station 3AW.
"Certainly while the virus is prevalent across the world (the 1.5 metre rule) should be a natural instinct."
"The alternative is that unfortunately students could face up to a year or longer at home and we don't that's appropriate," she added.
The ship is being held at an industrial port south of Sydney.

东京-日本在周四（4月16日）将紧急状态扩展到全国，因为Covid-19案件的数量在一周内翻了一番，达到9,000大关。
最初，由中央政府于4月7日宣布的紧急状态仅覆盖了七个县-东京，千叶、,玉，神奈川，大阪，兵库和福冈。
截至周四晚上9点，全国共有9,220例确诊的冠状病毒感染，近200例死亡。
东京的早晨人群下降了60％，但上周在大阪和福冈只有20％至30％。
上周末的许多媒体调查显示，五分之四的日本人认为紧急状态已经“太迟了”。

TOKYO - Japan expanded a state of emergency to the whole country on Thursday (April 16), as the number of Covid-19 cases doubled in one week to top the 9,000 mark.
Initially, the state of emergency declared by the national government on April 7 covered just seven prefectures – Tokyo, Chiba, Saitama, Kanagawa, Osaka, Hyogo and Fukuoka.
There were 9,220 confirmed coronavirus infections and nearly 200 deaths nationwide as at 9pm on Thursday.
Morning crowds were down 60 per cent in Tokyo, but just 20 to 30 per cent in Osaka and Fukuoka last week.
Numerous media polls last weekend showed that four in five Japanese had felt the state of emergency declaration had come “too late”.

雅加达•一名与冠状病毒斗争的高级官员说，印度尼西亚的Covid-19疫情可能在下个月达到高峰，约有100,000例病例，死亡人数超过1,000人。

然而，维库教授对公众和街头交通显着增加表示关注。
当被问到这一点时，维库教授说：“现在说政府不禁止混为一谈还为时过早。

JAKARTA • The Covid-19 outbreak in Indonesia may peak next month, with around 100,000 cases and a death toll of over 1,000 people, said a senior official in the fight against the coronavirus.
Judging by the unfolding situation, the death toll "may be more than 1,000 at the peak", Prof Wiku said, adding that the government was doing its utmost to avoid this outcome.
Prof Wiku, however, has expressed concerns over the noticeable increase in people out in public and traffic on the streets.
When asked about this, Prof Wiku said: "It is too early to say the government is not banning mudik.
This is the first time an official has hinted that the government may go ahead and ban mudik, although a final decision will not be taken until at least a week from now.

国防部的“令人矛盾的”数据国防部长马克·埃斯珀（Mark Esper）在周四的电视采访中说，该航空公司无症状的案件数量令人“令人不安”。
这样的数据给五角大楼带来了挑战，五角大楼在世界范围内部署，有时会在潜艇，轮船和飞机等密闭环境中使用。
官员们说，鉴于测试能力仍然有限，对整个军方进行测试尚不可行，如果大多数情况是无症状的，则不可能在没有测试的情况下发现足够多的案件​​。

'DISCONCERTING' DATA FOR PENTAGONDefence Secretary Mark Esper, speaking in a television interview on Thursday, said the number of asymptomatic cases from the carrier was "disconcerting."
Such data present challenges to the Pentagon, which is deployed around the world, sometimes in confined environments like submarines, ships and aircraft.
Testing the entire military is not yet feasible, given still-limited testing capacity, officials say, and detecting enough cases without tests is impossible if most cases are asymptomatic.

拉卜（Raab）周四主持了一次紧急会议，以审查有关现有封锁影响的科​​学证据。
他说：“根据这些建议，政府决定目前的措施至少必须在未来三周内保持不变。”
Raab提出了五个宽松条件，必须解除这些条件才能解除锁定，但拒绝讨论任何可能的时间表。
他告诉英国广播公司广播电台：“如果我们放松太多措施，我们将看到传输重新流行。”

Raab is deputising while Prime Minister Boris Johnson recuperates from Covid-19 complications that nearly cost him his life.
Raab chaired an emergency meeting on Thursday to review scientific evidence on the impact of the existing lockdown.
“Based on this advice... the government has decided that the current measures must remain in place for at least the next three weeks,” he said.
Raab set out five loose conditions which must be met for the lockdown to be lifted, but refused to discuss any possible timeline.
“If we relax measures too much then we will see a resurgence in transmission,” he told BBC radio.
