警方说，嫌疑人在新斯科舍省的不同地方开枪射击，其中许多人是随机的。
加拿大皇家骑警（RCMP）官员抵达后在住所内外发现“数人伤亡”，但未找到嫌疑人。
他说：“他的车与我们的加拿大皇家骑警车有一个区别：车号[登记牌]。
新斯科舍省皇家骑警指挥官，助理专员李·伯杰曼（Lee Bergerman）在Facebook帖子中说：“海蒂回答了使命召唤，在保护自己所服务的人的同时丧生了。”
根据新斯科舍省教师联盟的一份声明，德伯特小学老师丽莎·麦库利（Lisa McCully）在袭击中也被打死。

Police said the suspect shot people at different locations in Nova Scotia, many of them randomly.
Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers arrived to find "several casualties" inside and outside the home, but did not find the suspect.
"There's one difference between his car and our Royal Canadian Mounted Police vehicles: the car \# [registration plate].
"Heidi answered the call of duty and lost her life while protecting those she served," Nova Scotia RCMP Commanding Officer, Assistant Commissioner Lee Bergerman said in a Facebook post.
Lisa McCully, a teacher at Debert Elementary School, was also killed in the attack, according to a statement from the Nova Scotia Teachers Union.

然后他说：“我认为我已经十年没有洗手了。”暗示鼻子的整体起皱，以及十年后关于您手上可能有什么的疯狂文章。
令人不安的是，赫格斯与人相处融洽。 2015年，女演员詹妮弗·劳伦斯（Jennifer Lawrence）丢下了重磅炸弹，说她上厕所后几乎从不洗手。
同年，北卡罗莱纳州的共和党参议员提出，要求饭店员工洗手是过度监管的典型例子。
一项研究估计，在2015年，只有26.2％的全球卫生间访问可能与“粪便接触”，然后用肥皂洗手。
2006年的一项审查发现，经常洗手可以减少6％至44％的呼吸道感染风险。

Then he said: “I don’t think I’ve washed my hands for 10 years.” Cue a collective wrinkling of noses, and a frenzy of articles about what might be on your hands after a decade.
Disconcertingly, Hegseth is in good company; in 2015 the actress Jennifer Lawrence dropped the bombshell that she almost never washes her hands after going to the bathroom.
That same year, the Republican Senator for North Carolina suggested that requiring restaurant employees to wash their hands was a classic example of over-regulation.
One study estimated that in 2015, just 26.2% of global bathroom visits with potential “faecal contact” were followed by hand washing with soap.
A 2006 review found that regularly washing your hands can cut your risk of respiratory infections by between 6 and 44%.

Gary Lineker scored in the 1986 FA Cup final for Everton - a game they lost to LiverpoolIn the mid-1980s the emerging team from Merseyside was Everton.
They added the European Cup Winners' Cup in Rotterdam, defeating Bayern Munich en route and were only denied a treble by a Norman Whiteside wonder-goal in the FA Cup final.
During the exclusion period, both Euro 92 and World Cup 94 were competitions missing a truly great side.
Two months later Bulgaria reached the World Cup semi-finals on the back of Hristo Stoichkov, with winners Brazil reliant on Romario's goals.
An enthralling unit denied their European Cup hat-trick and ultimately unable to match their forebears at Ajax.

“As one example, the increase in hand sanitiser purchasing made it virtually out of stock in many European countries.
Australia’s “blended” healthcare system, a mixture of universal coverage through Medicare and a much-used private system, has helped prepare the country for any worst-case scenarios.
If current trends continue, it’s expected that the Australian healthcare system will be able to manage the expected increase in need for ventilators and ICU beds.

莱奥塔（Leotta）船长在邮轮上工作了32年，此前在油轮上工作了三年，在意大利海军工作了一年。
当他们于1月19日在巴西对接时，该病毒已经离开中国，莱奥塔上尉也注意到了。
但是，随着3月14日壮丽号到达塔斯马尼亚岛，冠状病毒就赶上了这艘游轮。
对于拥有最终决定权的Leotta上尉来说，这是充满他们的旅程中的又一次头一次。
对于在悉尼海港度过70岁的安迪·格伯（Andy Gerber）而言，尽管没有上岸游览，但“地球上的最后一艘游轮”上的生活还是很愉快的。

Captain Leotta has worked on cruises for 32 years, after three years on tankers and one in the Italian navy.
By the time they docked in Brazil on 19 January, the virus had left China, and Captain Leotta had noticed.
But as the Magnifica approached Tasmania on 14 March, the coronavirus had caught up with the cruise ship.
For Captain Leotta - who had the final say - it was another first in a journey full of them.
For Andy Gerber, who turned 70 in Sydney harbour, life on board "the last cruise ship on Earth" has been enjoyable, despite the lack of shore visits.

美国总统唐纳德·特朗普昨天在白宫的简报会上继续与纽约州州长安德鲁·库莫（Andrew Cuomo）发生争执。
记者看到了白宫挑选的剪辑，其中包括州长称赞联邦政府的“非凡努力”的剪辑。
州长库莫（Cuomo）推翻了总统拥有重新开放美国经济的绝对权力的主张。
他坚持认为，纽约州应仅在进行更多测试后才放宽限制，并已敦促提高抗体测试的水平。
纽约州正在经历美国最大的疫情暴发，确诊病例近百万分之一，死亡13869人。

在冠状病毒大流行期间，石油市场承受着巨大的压力，需求急剧下降。
美国的存储设施现在正努力应对石油过剩的情况，从而进一步削弱了价格。
这也关乎我们是否可以存储它，直到锁定措施得到足够缓解以产生对石油产品的额外需求为止。
下降的原因还在于全球石油市场的技术性。

The oil market has come under intense pressure during the coronavirus pandemic with a huge slump in demand.
US storage facilities are now struggling to cope with the glut of oil, weakening prices further.
It's also about whether we can store it until the lockdowns are eased enough to generate some additional demand for oil products.
The drop was also driven by a technicality of the global oil market.

英国政府宣布了一项12.5亿英镑的一揽子计划，以支持不符合现有冠状病毒拯救计划的创新型新公司。
总理Rishi Sunak表示，在冠状病毒危机之后，初创企业将有助于推动英国的增长。
新成立的公司在成立初期往往会亏损，这使他们没有资格获得政府的紧急贷款计划。
该软件包受到了企业家社区的广泛欢迎，但是一些人警告说-与其他冠状病毒支持机制一样，复杂性是速度的敌人。
截至上周，在总额为3300亿英镑的一揽子援助计划中，已批准了超过10亿英镑的政府支持贷款。

Chancellor Rishi Sunak said start-ups would help power the UK's growth after the coronavirus crisis.
Newly-founded companies often lose money in their early years, which makes them ineligible for the government's emergency loan scheme.
The package has been broadly welcomed by the entrepreneur community but some have warned that - as with other coronavirus support mechanisms - complexity is the enemy of speed.
As of last week, just over £1bn in government-backed loans had been approved out of a total support package of £330bn.

早在1918年，维克（Vick）的VapoRub广告上就刊登了令人放心的事实标题：“西班牙流感-它是什么以及应如何对待。”
这次，主题是“增强”免疫系统。
（请阅读更多有关香料可以影响您健康的证据，以及热饮如何无法保护您免受Covid-19的侵害）。
没有增强免疫力的东西。不幸的是，丸，新潮的超级食品或健康习惯可以为健康的免疫系统提供捷径的想法是一个神话。
实际上，“增强”免疫系统的概念没有任何科学意义。

“Spanish Influenza – what it is and how it should be treated,” read the reassuringly factual headline to an advert for Vick’s VapoRub back in 1918.
This time, the theme is “boosting” the immune system.
(Read more about what evidence exists for the idea that spices can affect your health, and how hot drinks will not protect you from Covid-19).
There’s no such thing as boosted immunityUnfortunately, the idea that pills, trendy superfoods or wellness habits can provide a shortcut to a healthy immune system is a myth.
In fact, the concept of “boosting” your immune system doesn’t hold any scientific meaning whatsoever.

那不勒斯当然是披萨拿破仑（那不勒斯披萨）的中心，同一家族的几代人都是披萨洛（pizzamaker）的艺术。
配料中都反映了意大利国旗的颜色：西红柿表示红色；西红柿表示红色。白色奶酪；和绿色的罗勒。
因此，如何制作正宗的那不勒斯披萨，特别是对于那些不能去那不勒斯吃那不勒斯的人而言？
那不勒斯的披萨只使用两种类型的马苏里拉奶酪：用牛奶制成的菲奥蒂拿铁；或莫扎里拉di bufala，由生活在该国坎帕尼亚和拉齐奥地区的水牛乳制成。
家庭挑战真正的那不勒斯比萨协会举办了一个免费竞赛，名为\#VeraPizzaContest，面向比萨制作者（业余爱好者和专业人士），以了解谁制作和设计出最出色的比萨。

Naples is, of course, the hub of the pizza napoletana (Neapolitan pizza), with generations of the same family groomed in the art of being a pizzaiolo (pizzamaker).
The colours of the Italian flag were mirrored in the ingredients: tomatoes for red; cheese for white; and basil for green.
It’s [how you make] the dough that’s essentialSo, how does one make an authentic Neapolitan pizza, especially for those who can’t go to Naples to eat one?
Only two types of mozzarella are used for Neapolitan pizza: fior di latte made from cow’s milk; or mozzarella di bufala, made from the milk of the water buffalo that live in the country’s Campania and Lazio regions.
A home challenge The True Neapolitan Pizza Association is holding a free contest called \#VeraPizzaContest for pizza makers (amateur and professionals alike) to see who makes the best pizza designed and made at home.

对于其他人而言，情况无异于：在周围的人处处处感到尴尬，and琐的自我怀疑掩盖了每个决定。
如果您属于后一组，您可能会想知道为什么要成为领导者会让您感到恐惧，以及为什么觉得自己很难成为经理。
如果您的父母使紫罗兰萎缩，那么您也同样会增加几率。
关键是父母对您的举止。

You’ve probably noticed how some of your colleagues take to leadership roles like a duck to water.
It couldn’t be more different for others: bossing around people feels awkward, and a nagging self-doubt shadows every decision.
If you’re in the latter group, you might wonder why the thought of being a leader fills you with dread, and why you find it so hard to even see yourself as a manager.
If your parents were shrinking violets, the odds are increased that you will be too.
And key here is the way your parents behaved toward you.

在冠状病毒封锁之前，佐治亚·马斯克里（George Maskery）没有和自己说话，但是现在她正在成为自己的励志演说家，进行鼓舞人心的演讲。
不，不，我不确定，因为实际上我想我要做的是先吃早餐，因为这意味着午饭时间会比较阳光。
你没有意识到自己正在这样做，我想你越是习惯，就越难打破。”
她告诉自己：“实际上，你很烦，因为我想懒惰，现在你让我觉得我做得不够好。”
这种事，很少有评论，当你在客厅里时很好，但当你在伦敦迪斯与保鲜膜聊天时就不行了。”

Before the coronavirus lockdown Georgia Maskery didn't talk to herself, but now she's becoming her own motivational speaker, giving herself pep talks.
No, no, I'm not sure, because actually what I think I'm gonna do is have breakfast first, because it's meant to be sunnier at lunch time.
You don't realise you're doing it, and I guess the more you get into the habit, the harder it is to break."
"No actually, you're being annoying, because I want to wallow lazily and now you're making me feel like I'm not doing well enough," she tells herself.
That kind of thing, little comments, which is fine when you're in your living room but not when you're in Londis talking to the clingfilm."

## 饮食“作弊天”曾经是个好主意吗？

### Are diet ‘cheat days’ ever a good idea?

亨特同意：“当我被问到“哪种减肥方法可以帮助您减肥”时，我的回答总是一样：“您可以坚持的饮食”。
作弊的日子可能会产生心理影响，可能是积极的也可能是消极的–对某些人来说，如果您有一个作弊的日子，可以更容易地坚持节制饮食。人。
他说，只要在作弊的一天中合理饮食并且不包含很多高热量或不健康的食物（例如那些富含饱和脂肪，盐或糖的食物），就可以在作弊的一天中释放出蒸汽。
但是，许多人在作弊的日子过得很艰难，这是不健康的行为，有些人认为这可能增加进食障碍的风险。
亨特说：“您可能会认为作弊天对健美者的负面影响较小，因为卡路里并不是一个问题，但没有证据表明它们适合任何类型的饮食。”

Hunter agrees: “When I’m asked, ‘What’s the best type of diet to help you lose weight’, my reply is always the same: ‘the one you can stick to’.
Cheat days can have a psychological effect, and it can be positive or negative – for some people it can be easier to stick with a restricted diet if you have a cheat day to look forward.”Laidler has seen how different plans can work for different people.
He says letting off steam through a cheat day can work, as long as your cheat diet is sensible and doesn’t include lots of high-calorie or unhealthy foods, such as those high in saturated fat, salt or sugar.
However, many people go over the top on their cheat days, and this is unhealthy behaviour and some suggest this could increase the risk of eating disorders.
“You could argue cheat days are less likely to have a negative impact for body builders, because calories aren’t such an issue, but there is no evidence that they are suited to any type of diet”, says Hunter.
