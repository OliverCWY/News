Ottawa (CNN) Nova Scotia authorities have begun investigating the shooting of a gunman who may have been disguised as a police officer and went on 12-hour rampage that left 16 people dead in a small town.

A confrontation with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police began after a manhunt for the fleeing suspect overnight Saturday. Multiple crime scenes and hours of evasion later, the gunman was killed Sunday in a shootout with police. Nova Scotia Serious Incident Response Team (SiRT) took over the investigation into the death, according to a statement from SiRT.

Gabriel Wortman, 51, was identified as the suspect and was confirmed dead by RCMP Chief Superintendent Chris Leather.

The motive behind the shooting, one of Canada's deadliest, is still under investigation, Leather said. Some victims, he said, "appeared not to have a relationship with the assailant shooter."

The chaos began when police were first called to a property around 10:30 p.m. Saturday. "When police arrived at the scene the members located several casualties inside and outside of the home," Leather said.
