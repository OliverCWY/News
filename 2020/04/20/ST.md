新斯科舍省PORTAPIQUE（路透社）–当局周日（4月19日）称，在加拿大新斯科舍省的一次袭击中，一名伪装成警察的枪手在至少12小时的暴乱中杀死了至少16人。这个国家最糟糕的近代大规模射击。
警察在简报中说，沃特曼在大西洋省的多个地方开枪射击，死亡人数超过10。
全国皇家骑警负责人布伦达·卢基（Brenda Lucki）随后告诉加拿大广播公司，沃特曼（Wortman）至少杀死了13人。
“今天对新斯科舍省来说是毁灭性的一天，它将铭记在心很多年，”新斯科舍省皇家骑警指挥官李·伯杰曼对记者说。
像加拿大其他地区一样，新斯科舍省也因冠状病毒大流行而处于待命状态。

PORTAPIQUE, NOVA SCOTIA (REUTERS) – A gunman who at one point masqueraded as a policeman killed at least 16 people in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia during a 12-hour rampage, authorities said on Sunday (April 19), in what was the country’s worst modern-era mass shooting.
Wortman shot people in several locations across the Atlantic province, police told a briefing, saying the death toll was more than 10.
Brenda Lucki, who heads the RCMP nationally, later told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp that Wortman killed at least 13 people.
“Today is a devastating day for Nova Scotia, and it will remain etched in the minds for many years to come,” Lee Bergerman, commanding officer of the RCMP in Nova Scotia, told reporters.
Nova Scotia, like the rest of Canada, is under a stay-at-home order because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Datuk Shamsuddin表示，该国最多可能有330万非法劳工，而有证件的非法劳工为220万。
他说，“保守估计”使该国非法外国工人的数量与合法外国工人的数量相当。
他补充说：“政府需要加大努力，控制Covid-19在非法外国工人中的传播。”
他说，有证件的外劳将不会面临医疗方面的问题，因为外劳住院和手术保险计划涵盖了这些问题。
他补充说，根据《就业法》，雇主有责任为外国工人的待遇提供咨询费。

Datuk Shamsuddin said there could be up to 3.3 million illegal workers in the country, against 2.2 million documented ones.
He said a "conservative estimate" put the number of illegal foreign workers in the country on par with their legalised counterparts.
"The government needs to put more effort to control the spread of Covid-19 among illegal foreign workers, " he added.
He said documented foreign workers would not face issues on medical treatment as they were covered by the Foreign Worker Hospitalisation and Surgical Insurance Scheme.
He added that under the Employment Act, employers were liable to provide consultation fees for treatment of foreign workers.

环保人士说，由于冠状病毒的大流行，泰国在二十年来的游客海滩上发现了数量最多的稀有棱皮海龟巢。
普吉岛海洋生物中心主任Kongkiat Kittiwatanawong说，自去年11月以来发现的11个海龟巢是20年来最高的。
棱皮龟是世界上最大的海龟。
它们在泰国被视为濒临灭绝，并被国际自然保护联盟列为全球脆弱物种。

BANGKOK (REUTERS) - Thailand has found the largest number of nests of rare leatherback sea turtles in two decades on beaches bereft of tourists because of the coronavirus pandemic, environmentalists say.
The 11 turtle nests authorities have found since last November were the highest number in 20 years, said Kongkiat Kittiwatanawong, the director of the Phuket Marine Biological Center.
Leatherbacks are the world's largest sea turtles.
They are considered endangered in Thailand, and listed as a vulnerable species globally by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.
They lay their eggs in dark and quiet areas, scarce when tourists thronged the beaches.

斯德哥尔摩（彭博社）-瑞典最流行的流行病学家说，瑞典与冠状病毒大流行作斗争的不寻常方法开始取得成果。
目前尚不清楚哪种策略最终将证明是最有效的，甚至瑞典专家也警告说，下结论还为时过早。
但是，鉴于严格的封锁措施造成了巨大的经济损失，瑞典的做法引起了全世界的极大兴趣。
瑞典星期日（4月19日）的死亡比率报告说，与Covid-19相关的死亡人数为1,540，与星期六相比增加了29。
汇丰银行全球研究部经济学家詹姆斯·波默罗伊（James Pomeroy）表示，瑞典的Covid-19战略最终可能会导致经济萎缩，尽管历史上的深度要比欧洲其他地区小。

STOCKHOLM (BLOOMBERG) - Sweden's unusual approach to fighting the coronavirus pandemic is starting to yield results, according to the country's top epidemiologist.
It's unclear which strategy will ultimately prove most effective, and even experts in Sweden warn it's too early to draw conclusions.
But given the huge economic damage caused by strict lockdowns, the Swedish approach has drawn considerable interest around the world.
DEATH RATESAs of Sunday (April 19), Sweden had reported 1,540 deaths tied to Covid-19, an increase of 29 from Saturday.
THE ECONOMYSweden's Covid-19 strategy may ultimately result in a smaller - albeit historically deep - economic contraction than the rest of Europe is now facing, according to HSBC Global Research economist James Pomeroy.

日内瓦（新华社）-世界卫生组织（WHO）总干事特德罗斯·阿达诺姆·格布列索苏斯（Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus）周日（4月19日）表示，解除对Covid-19的封锁限制并不是冠状病毒流行的终结，而仅仅是下一阶段的开始。
“令我们感到鼓舞的是，一些二十国集团国家现在已开始计划如何减轻社会限制。
他说：“需要紧急支持，不仅要支持各国应对Covid-19，而且还要确保其他基本卫生服务继续下去。”
特德罗斯博士还借此机会感谢沙特阿拉伯王国对全球抗击该病毒的支持。
沙特阿拉伯周四宣布向相关国际组织捐款5亿美元（合7.12亿新元），以支持全球打击Covid-19的努力。

GENEVA (XINHUA) - World Health Organisation (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Sunday (April 19) that lifting lockdown restrictions for Covid-19 is not the end of the coronavirus epidemic, it's just the beginning of the next phase.
"We are encouraged that several G-20 countries are now starting to plan how to ease social restrictions.
"Urgent support is needed, not only to support countries to respond to Covid-19, but to ensure other essential health services continue," he said.
Dr Tedros also took the opportunity to thank the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for its support to the global fight against the virus.
Saudi Arabia announced on Thursday a US$500 million (S$712 million) donation to relevant international organisations to support global efforts in combating the Covid-19.

由于担心位于俄克拉荷马州库欣的主要美国仓储设施已经装满，WTI的近期价格与较晚的合同相比有大幅折让。
“目前的价格显示，欧佩克+的减产已被证明是短暂的，石油价格再次受到病毒的摆布，” Vanda Insights新加坡创始人Vandana Hari说。
“在我们解除对美国的封锁之前，石油可能会下跌或保持在当前水平附近波动。”
ICE期货欧洲交易所6月交割的布伦特原油下跌1.6％，至每桶27.63美元，上周下跌10.8％。
“我们必须看到Covid-19在全球范围内达到顶峰，以便更清晰地了解销毁多少需求。”

Near-term prices for WTI are trading at huge discounts to later-dated contracts on concern the main US storage facilities in Cushing, Oklahoma, were filling up.
"The current prices show that the Opec+ cuts proved to be a blip, with oil prices at the mercy of the virus once again," said Vandana Hari, founder of Vanda Insights in Singapore.
"Until we approach a lifting of the lockdowns in the US, oil may drift lower or remain rangebound around current levels."
Brent for June delivery fell 1.6 per cent to US$27.63 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange after losing 10.8 per cent last week.
"We have to see a peak for Covid-19 globally to get a clearer picture of how much demand will be destroyed."

北京（彭博社）-中国正在重新开放该国南部的一些活禽市场，因为那是当地人喜欢家禽的方式-被新杀害。
该国最大的种鸡企业温斯食品集团（Wens Foodstuffs Group Co）表示，由于从冠状病毒中恢复了消费，3月份的鸡肉销量比去年同期增长了18％。
回到活禽市场，农业部上个月要求一些省份逐步重新开放，以帮助家禽生产恢复。
不过，据当地媒体报道，包括福建，贵州和重庆在内的一些地方政府无限期地关闭了市场。
荷兰合作银行资深畜牧分析师潘晨军说：“大多数活禽市场最终将消失，但关闭全国所有市场将非常困难。”

BEIJING (BLOOMBERG) - China is reopening some live bird markets in the south of the country because that's the way the locals like their fowl - freshly killed.
Wens Foodstuffs Group Co, the country's largest breeder, said chicken sales rose 18 per cent in March from a year earlier as consumption recovered from the coronavirus.
Back in the live bird markets, the agriculture ministry asked some provinces last month to reopen them gradually to help poultry production recover.
Still, some local governments, including Fujian, Guizhou and Chongqing, have shuttered their markets indefinitely, according to local media reports.
"Most live bird markets will eventually disappear, but it will be difficult to shut down all the markets across the country," said Pan Chenjun, a senior livestock analyst with Rabobank.
