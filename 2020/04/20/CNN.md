然而，特朗普在拖网搜捕后坚持认为：“这与我无关。
特朗普在通报会开幕式上说，美国进行的总测试量超过了一系列发达国家。
但是现在他们想让我们联邦政府进行测试。”
特朗普似乎很愤慨，要求他使用联邦储备的通风机，并最终援引战时权力来增加其生产量。
这只是局外人特朗普似乎to视他本应领导的政府权力的最新情况。

Yet Trump insisted after his trawl for personal credit: "It's not about me.
Trump opened up his briefing by saying that the US had conducted more gross tests than a list of developed countries.
But now they want to have us, the federal government, do the testing," Trump said.
Trump appeared resentful that he was asked to use a federal stockpile of ventilators and finally invoked wartime powers to surge their manufacture.
It's just the latest occasion when Trump, the outsider, has seemed to flout the authority of the government he is supposed to lead.

副总裁，副总裁，副总裁：受冠状病毒危机影响不大的政治传统之一是，前任副总统乔·拜登（Joe Biden）将选谁为竞选伙伴的无休止的竞争和猜测。
是的，在那个时期，前副总统赢得了更多初选，并成为反对唐纳德·特朗普总统的事实上的民主党候选人。
特朗普在周六的每日冠状病毒简报会上说：“我注意到那里有很多抗议活动。”
特朗普是如何失去公众的：在社会疏离和保持家庭秩序的初期，特朗普经历了民意测验的激增，这是他在总统任期内从未见​​过的。
无论如何，公众舆论都将特朗普视为冠状病毒-并将他的总体批准数字恢复到一切开始之前的水平。

VP, VP, VP: One of the political traditions that hasn't been much affected by the coronavirus crisis is the unending jockeying among and speculation about who former Vice President Joe Biden will choose as his running mate.
Yes, in that time, the former vice president won more primaries and became the de facto Democratic nominee against President Donald Trump.
"I notice there were a lot of protests out there," Trump said at Saturday's daily coronavirus briefing.
How Trump lost the public: In the early days of social distancing and stay-at-home orders, Trump experienced a polling surge the likes of which he has never seen before in his presidency.
Regardless, public opinion has turned on Trump over coronavirus -- and it has returned his overall approval numbers back to where they were before this all began.

渥太华（CNN）新斯科舍省当局已开始调查枪手的枪击事件，枪手可能被伪装成警察，并持续12小时的暴行，在一个小镇上造成16人死亡。
周六通宵逃离嫌疑犯后，与加拿大皇家骑警的对抗开始了。
多个犯罪现场和数小时后的逃避，枪手周日在与警察的枪战中被杀。
根据SiRT的一份声明，新斯科舍省严重事件响应小组（SiRT）接管了对死亡的调查。

Ottawa (CNN) Nova Scotia authorities have begun investigating the shooting of a gunman who may have been disguised as a police officer and went on 12-hour rampage that left 16 people dead in a small town.
A confrontation with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police began after a manhunt for the fleeing suspect overnight Saturday.
Multiple crime scenes and hours of evasion later, the gunman was killed Sunday in a shootout with police.
Nova Scotia Serious Incident Response Team (SiRT) took over the investigation into the death, according to a statement from SiRT.

（CNN）上周末，就地庇护所令人们大为恼火，抗议者无视社会疏散指引，并挤满了人行道和街道。
在安纳波利斯的大街上响起汽车喇叭声，马里兰州“重新开放”组织的成员说，企业的倒闭在财务上造成了灾难性的破坏。
马里兰州的一名抗议者说，如果企业不尽快重新营业，她担心自己的未来。
里昂对CNN附属机构WTHR表示：“如果我生病了，那我就要承担我生病的后果。”
惠特默周日告诉美国有线电视新闻网的“国情咨文”，她的州肯定还没有准备好重新开放。

(CNN) Anger over shelter-in-place orders boiled over this weekend, with protesters ignoring social distancing guidelines and packing sidewalks and streets.
Car horns blared in the streets of Annapolis, where members of the group Reopen Maryland said the closures of businesses have been financially devastating.
A protester in Maryland says she's worried about her future if businesses don't reopen soon.
"If I get sick, then I am going to bear the consequences of my getting sick," Lyons told CNN affiliate WTHR .
Whitmer told CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday that her state is definitely not ready to reopen.

## 新加坡有典型的冠状病毒反应，随后病例激增。发生了什么？

香港（CNN）不到一个月前，新加坡被誉为正确应对冠状病毒的国家之一。
费舍尔上个月写道：“在新加坡，我们希望生活继续正常进行。”
这种做法与香港形成了鲜明的对比：香港是另一个亚洲自治的城市，人口相近。
延误使新的新加坡病例数量上升到更加陡峭的轨道-周四它报告了728例新病例，这是单日最大的增长。
但是，最近新加坡案件的激增为世界其他地区提供了经验教训。

Hong Kong (CNN) Less than a month ago, Singapore was being hailed as one of the countries that had got its coronavirus response right.
"In Singapore, we want life to go on as normal," Fisher wrote last month, before the latest spike in cases.
That approach stood in stark contrast to Hong Kong: another Asian self-governed city with a similar size population.
The delay has put the number of new Singapore cases on a much steeper trajectory -- on Thursday it reported 728 new cases -- its largest single day increase.
But the recent spike in cases in Singapore has lessons for the rest of the world.

（CNN）当局说，星期六有10万多人违反了孟加拉国的封锁令，参加了在Brahmanbaria区举行的伊斯兰党高级领导人的葬礼。
总理特别助理沙阿·阿里·法哈德（Shah Ali Farhad）和婆罗洲警察局发言人伊姆蒂亚兹·艾哈迈德（Imtiaz Ahmed）证实了估计的人群规模。
伊斯兰教老师毛拉娜·祖拜尔·艾哈迈德·安萨里（Maulana Zubayer Ahmad Ansari）的葬礼打破了该国禁止一次最多参加五人祈祷的禁令，引发了人们对该事件再次爆发冠状病毒的担忧。
伊斯兰党联席秘书长穆罕默德·马穆努尔·哈克（Mohammad Mamunul Haque）表示，成千上万的人淹没了通往布拉曼巴里亚地区的道路，从周围地区走来参加葬礼。
孟加拉国Sohel Rana称，警察无法控制人群，导致负责人员和助理警长退出活动，并组建了一个委员会，开始调查如何允许如此众多的人群聚集警察中央发言人。

(CNN) More than 100,000 people defied Bangladesh's lockdown order on Saturday to attend the funeral of a senior leader of the Islamist party in the district of Brahmanbaria, authorities said.
The estimated size of the crowd was confirmed by the prime minister's special assistant, Shah Ali Farhad and the Brahmanbaria police spokesman, Imtiaz Ahmed.
The funeral for Maulana Zubayer Ahmad Ansari, an Islamic teacher, broke the country's ban of no more than five people attending prayers at one time, sparking fears of a new coronavirus outbreak emerging from the event.
Tens of thousands of people flooded the roads to Brahmanbaria district, walking from the surrounding areas to attend the funeral, according to Mohammad Mamunul Haque, the joint secretary general of the Islamist party.
The police were unable to control the crowd, resulting in the officer in charge and assistant superintendent being withdrawn from the event and a committee being formed to start an investigation into how such a large crowd was allowed to congregate, according to Sohel Rana, the Bangladesh Police Central spokesman.

（CNN）-尽管在Covid-19大流行中，全球数以百万计的人正在修剪自己的头发并发明新的食谱，但世界上成千上万的商用飞机也需要休息。
飞机被定期拖曳，以使它们的轮子可以旋转，并且维修人员清洁飞机的内部和外部。
费用通常取决于飞机的重量，可以理解，大型客机的存储成本更高。
也最好将飞机存放在温暖的地方，因为干燥的空气不太可能腐蚀飞机的金属零件。
当然，澳航目前并不是世界上唯一一家照顾陆上飞机的航空公司。

(CNN) — While millions of people around the world are cutting their own hair and inventing new recipes amid the Covid-19 pandemic, thousands of the world's commercial airplanes are also getting much-needed rest.
The planes are towed periodically around so that their wheels can rotate, and service members clean the inside and outside of the aircraft.
Fees are often determined by the weight of the plane, with huge passenger aircraft being understandably more expensive to store.
It's also preferable to store planes in warm areas, as dry air is less likely to corrode a plane's metal parts.
Qantas, of course, isn't the only airline in the world taking care of its grounded planes right now.

（CNN）春季的第一个流星雨被称为Lyrid流星雨，它将呈现一个从周日晚上开始至周三晚上最高的夜空观看节目。
自从一月初以来，还没有流星雨照亮天空，全球都可以看到。
与2019年不同，月亮的减弱将使这些明亮的流星更清晰可见。
根据美国流星协会的说法，根据您所在的位置，在当地时间午夜至凌晨4点至凌晨5点之间的深夜和清晨时间可能是观看流星或流星在我们的大气层中燃烧的最佳时机。最好的时间是看到速度较慢，较长的流星在水平方向上水平划过，这就是所谓的“掠地者”。
其中一些路径在流星消失后会发光几秒钟。

(CNN) The first meteor shower of spring, known as the Lyrid meteor shower, will present a night skywatching show beginning on Sunday evening and peaking on Wednesday night.
There hasn't been a meteor shower to light up the sky since early January, and this one will be visible around the globe.
And unlike 2019, the waning moon will allow a better view of these bright meteors.
Late evening and early morning hours based on your location, between midnight and 4 a.m to 5 a.m. local time, may be the best time to see shooting stars, or meteors that burn up in our atmosphere, according to the American Meteor SocietyBefore midnight will be the best time to see slower, longer meteors that streak horizontally across the sky, called earthgrazers.
Some of them have trails that glow for seconds after the meteor has disappeared.

了解染料的来源和组成是保存中世纪照明手稿的关键。
梅洛说：“这个跨学科团队能够解决解决这个已有1000年历史的谜团所需要的所有角度。”
图片来源：Paula Nabais / NOVA大学他们将中世纪的植物Chrozophora tinctoria归功于中世纪的消息来源，这是一种自然的颜色来源，产生了蓝色和紫色染料。
这种小药草以覆盖独特的银色毛发而闻名。
研究人员了解到，与从其他蓝色花朵和果实中提取的叶色素不同，叶色素不是一种染料。

Understanding the source and composition of the dye is key to preserving medieval illuminated manuscripts.
"This interdisciplinary team was able to tackle all angles necessary for solving this 1,000-years-old mystery," Melo said.

The small herb is known for its covering of distinct, silvery hairs.
The researchers learned that folium isn't a dye similar to those extracted from other blue flowers and fruits.

Everyone is doing these virtual meetings and you see so many backgrounds of people's homes.
And then you can place a piece of art on that, and you have this great background for your virtual meeting.
The furniture is very comfortable, and there's a really great plush rug.

## 您需要安全的家庭分娩

瓦特伯格说：“我认为，作为医学专业人士，我们需要做得更好，因为认识到出生并不一定需要医疗。”
对于那些想要在家分娩的人，这是AAP更新的指南所建议的。
报告说，对于初学者来说，确保您安全，及时地运输，以防在出生前遇到意外的并发症。
我认为，Covid-19实际上是对计划分娩而不是紧急分娩的论点。”
总体而言，妇女应该意识到自己是否适合在家分娩，瓦特伯格说。

"I think we as medical professionals need to do a better job of recognizing that birth does not necessarily need to be medicalized," Watterberg said.
For those who do want to have a home birth, this is what the AAP's updated guidelines recommend.
For starters, making sure you have safe and timely transportation in case you experience unanticipated complications before the birth, the report said.
I think that Covid-19 is actually an argument for a planned hospital birth rather than an emergency one."
Overall, women should be aware of whether they're a good candidate for giving birth at home, Watterberg said.

## 历史上最致命的空袭发生在二战期间的东京，您可能从未听说过

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
后来空袭被认为是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

但是，美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）采访了包括帕特里夏（Patricia）在内的五名十几岁和二十多岁的女性，他们声称格拉瑟（Glaser）在Bery's Place对其进行了性和情感虐待。
当女孩们反对时，他们说格拉泽会威胁要把他们赶出去。
一些幸存者说，格拉瑟（Glaser）介绍自己是一名医生，但支持起诉的律师告诉美国有线电视新闻网（CNN），他是物理治疗师-不是合格的医生。
Dilen于去年2月在Bery's Place进行的一次警察突袭中因警察的讯问而被捕，后来被释放。
但至少现在，他们说他们开始在贝里故居之外享受生活。

But five women in their late teens and early twenties interviewed by CNN, including Patricia, allege that Glaser sexually and emotionally abused them at Bery's Place.
When the girls objected, they say Glaser would threaten to cast them out on the streets.
Some survivors say Glaser introduced himself as a doctor, but lawyers supporting the prosecution told CNN that he is a physiotherapist -- not a qualified physician.
Dilen was arrested for questioning by police last February during a police raid at Bery's Place, and later released.
But for now, at least, they say they're beginning to enjoy their lives outside of Bery's Place.

## 香港冠状病毒检疫营内的情况

### What it's like inside a Hong Kong coronavirus quarantine camp

假日营地变成了隔离营地-隔离饮食-温度检查和穿PPE的工作人员在隔离区生活-感觉就像在学校，营地和监狱中一样奇怪。
我的工厂位于鲤鱼门公园，通常是香港岛东部一个绿树成荫的度假村。
这个假日公园是香港用作冠状病毒检疫中心的几处设施之一。
在此之前，我已经在家工作了三个月-因此，在隔离营中做同样的事情并没有多大区别。
但这证明了香港政府对遏制从海外进口的案件并推回本地自满情绪的重视程度。

Holiday camp turned quarantine campLife in quarantine -- with its regimented meals, temperature checks and PPE-wearing staff -- feels like an odd mix of being in school, at camp, and in prison.
My facility, in Lei Yue Mun Park, is normally a leafy holiday village in the east of Hong Kong Island.
This holiday park is one of several facilities being used as coronavirus quarantine centers in Hong KongSince March, that number has surged.
Prior to now, I'd already been working from home for three months -- so doing the same from a quarantine camp hasn't made much of a difference.
But it's a testament to how serious the Hong Kong government is about clamping down on cases imported from overseas, and pushing back on local complacency.
