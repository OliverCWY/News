A review suggests the most effective strategy for long-term weight-loss and heart health is a healthy dietary pattern that’s compatible with what you like to eat and your lifestyle. It’s about finding what works for you. Hunter agrees: “When I’m asked, ‘What’s the best type of diet to help you lose weight’, my reply is always the same: ‘the one you can stick to’. Cheat days can have a psychological effect, and it can be positive or negative – for some people it can be easier to stick with a restricted diet if you have a cheat day to look forward.”

Laidler has seen how different plans can work for different people. “There are two types of people when it comes to dieting”, he says, “those who need to let off steam in exchange for the discipline, and those who feel a sense of achievement from adhering to a plan”. He says letting off steam through a cheat day can work, as long as your cheat diet is sensible and doesn’t include lots of high-calorie or unhealthy foods, such as those high in saturated fat, salt or sugar.

However, many people go over the top on their cheat days, and this is unhealthy behaviour and some suggest this could increase the risk of eating disorders.

So what if you’re trying to build muscle rather than lose weight? “You could argue cheat days are less likely to have a negative impact for body builders, because calories aren’t such an issue, but there is no evidence that they are suited to any type of diet”, says Hunter.
