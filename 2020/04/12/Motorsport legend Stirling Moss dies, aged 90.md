London (CNN) Stirling Moss, a British motor racing legend widely considered one of the greatest drivers never to win a Formula One title, has died aged 90, according to PA news agency and the Formula One website.

His wife, Susie Moss, told PA that he "died peacefully at his London home following a long illness."

"It was one lap too many," she said. "He just closed his eyes."

Moss was an active race driver between 1948 and 1962, competing in numerous classifications and winning 212 of the 529 races he competed in, famously including the 1955 Mille Miglia, a 1,000 mile (1,600km) race across Italy, in record time.

Stirling Moss competed in motoring festivals into his 80s.

He was also the F1 Driver's Championship runner-up on four occasions over the course of his career.
