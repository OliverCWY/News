The UK death toll from the coronavirus outbreak surpassed 10,000 on Sunday, another grim statistic that brings tragedy to more families.

But what does that figure tell us about the trajectory of the UK’s coronavirus epidemic? There is some important context to consider.

Firstly, the growth in the total number of new deaths appears to have stalled in the last five days, despite hitting a record 980 on 10 April. In other countries, virus-related deaths stopped growing after three weeks of lockdown. But experts have stressed it is too early to know if deaths have peaked yet.

Secondly, it is important to note the death figures being reported daily are hospital cases where a person dies with Covid-19. What those figures do not tell us is the extent the virus is causing the death. Other factors, such as an underlying health condition, may have contributed to that person’s death.

Equally, the figures do not tell us how many virus-related deaths there have been in care homes and the wider community.

Lastly, we come to projections of deaths. Modelling by Imperial College London suggested deaths could be limited to 20,000 if a lockdown was implemented.

In Sunday’s Downing Street briefing, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that outcome was still possible if “people follow the social-distancing guidelines”.
