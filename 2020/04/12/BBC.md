周日，英国冠状病毒爆发造成的死亡人数超过10,000，这是另一个严峻的统计数字，给更多家庭带来了悲剧。
在其他国家，与病毒相关的死亡在锁定三周后停止增长。
同样，这些数字也没有告诉我们在疗养院和更广泛的社区中有多少与病毒有关的死亡。
在周日的唐宁街简报中，英国卫生部长马特·汉考克（Matt Hancock）表示，如果“人们遵循社会疏远准则”，仍然有可能取得结果。
阅读有关如何了解死亡人数的更多信息

The UK death toll from the coronavirus outbreak surpassed 10,000 on Sunday, another grim statistic that brings tragedy to more families.
In other countries, virus-related deaths stopped growing after three weeks of lockdown.
Equally, the figures do not tell us how many virus-related deaths there have been in care homes and the wider community.
In Sunday’s Downing Street briefing, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that outcome was still possible if “people follow the social-distancing guidelines”.

55岁的约翰逊先生周日被送往伦敦的圣托马斯医院-在检测Covid-19呈阳性后的10天。
他在推特上的一段视频中说，他目睹了第一线医院工作人员的“个人勇气”。
他要感谢圣托马斯中心的每一个人，感谢他的出色照顾。
约翰逊出院后为许多人提供救济甚至在我们听说鲍里斯·约翰逊出院后，很显然总理就不会急着上班。
同意或不同意迄今为止处理冠状病毒爆发的方式，鲍里斯·约翰逊是当选总理，政治权威最终由该办公室负责。

Mr Johnson, 55, was taken to London's St Thomas' Hospital on Sunday - 10 days after testing positive for Covid-19.
He said in a video on Twitter that he had witnessed the "personal courage" of hospital staff on the front line.
He wishes to thank everybody at St Thomas' for the brilliant care he has received.
Relief for many as Johnson is discharged from hospitalEven before we heard that Boris Johnson had been discharged from hospital it was clear the prime minister would not be rushing back to work.
Agree or disagree with the way the coronavirus outbreak has been handled so far, Boris Johnson is the elected prime minister and political authority ultimately rests with that office.

像许多治疗冠状病毒患者的卫生保健专业人员一样，珍妮弗（Jennifer）与家人分开生活。
她在USNS Comfort高速公路上看了一下，USNS Comfort是一艘停泊在纽约市，正在接受冠状病毒患者治疗的海军医院船，并以为自己看起来似乎很雄伟。
但是三周后，尽管有风险，她仍继续在冠状病毒患者的中心工作。
11:00在另一个疗养院，凯瑟琳·弗拉纳根（Kathleen Flanagan）上午大部分时间都在检查有冠状病毒症状的居民。
在4月7日星期二的这一整天中，纽约州又有779人死于​​冠状病毒，这是一个新高。

Like many healthcare professionals working with coronavirus patients, Jennifer is living separately from her family.
She looks over the highway at the USNS Comfort - a Navy hospital ship docked in New York City where coronavirus patients are being treated - and thinks to herself that it seems almost majestic.
But three weeks later, she continues to take a hands-on role at the centres with coronavirus patients in spite of the risks.
11:00At another nursing and rehabilitation home, Kathleen Flanagan has spent much of the morning checking on residents with coronavirus symptoms.
Throughout this day, Tuesday 7 April, another 779 people died of coronavirus in New York state - a new high.

如果您是第一次在家工作，您可能会问自己为什么几年前没有这样做。
远程工作的好处已经讨论了近半个世纪。
许多思想家预测，不久的将来工作将移交给工人，而不是工人移交给工作。

If you’re working from home for the first time, you might be asking yourself why you didn’t get to do this years ago.
The benefits of remote work have been discussed for nearly half a century.
Many thinkers predicted a near future where work moves to the worker, rather than the worker to the work.
In 1969, Alan Kiron, a staff scientist at the US Patent Office, wrote in The Washington Post about how computers and new communication tools could change life and work.

已经有近500家试图开业的电影院在收到政府的来信后再次关闭。
电影制片厂做出的反应是，将最近才在电影院上映的电影放到网上，这加剧了电影院所有者的痛苦。
电影院如何应对过去的大流行一百年前，甚至现在，人们担心电影院会被病毒永久关闭。
至关重要的是，制片厂洛杉矶的家园受到严重影响，加利福尼亚的电影院关闭了七个星期。
自从在过去的几个月中冠状病毒在世界范围内传播以来，电影院已经关闭，而不是像1918年那样零散，临时地关闭。

Already, the almost 500 cinemas that tried to open have shut down again after receiving a letter from the government.
Compounding the misery for cinema owners is the fact that film studios have responded by putting films only very recently released in cinemas online.
How cinemas dealt with a past pandemicA century ago, there was even the worry, as there is now, that cinemas would be permanently shut down by a virus.
Critically, the home of the studios, Los Angeles, was severely affected and cinemas in California closed for seven weeks.
Since the coronavirus has spread across the world over the last couple of months, cinemas have closed, not in the patchy, ad-hoc fashion of 1918, but all at once.

特朗普总统上个月曾表示，他希望复活节周日能看到所有教堂都满员。
绝大多数美国教堂都通过试验简化的直播或预先录制的服务来适应日冕危机。
他说：“暂停当面崇拜不仅是为了保护那些去参加真正的教堂礼拜的人。”
特尔福特（Telfort）的教区拉斐特大道长老教会（Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church）通常以双重合唱团和铜管乐队来庆祝复活节。
许多人还将以一种新颖而凄美的方式聆听熟悉的复活节故事。

Telfort's parish, the Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church, usually celebrates Easter with a double choir and a brass band.
And many will also be hearing the familiar Easter story in a new and poignant way.

石油生产国欧佩克及其盟国周四宣布了创纪录的减产计划，但在墨西哥对减产感到不满之后，该计划遭到质疑。
墨西哥后来表示，由于与美国达成了帮助削减关税的协议，他们将继续前进。
美国总统唐纳德·特朗普说，他已提议“帮助墨西哥”。
洛佩兹·奥夫拉多尔先生说，美国每天将进一步削减石油产量25万桶，使墨西哥仅削减10万桶。
FXTM货币策略和市场研究全球负责人Jameel Ahmad说，减产“不是最终的答案”。

Oil producers group Opec and allies on Thursday announced the record supply cut, but the plans were cast in doubt after Mexico baulked at the cuts.
Mexico later said they would move forward, thanks to a deal with the US to help shoulder the reductions.
US President Donald Trump said he had proposed to "help Mexico along".
Mr Lopez Obrador said the US would make 250,000 barrels per day in additional cuts to its oil output, allowing Mexico to cut just 100,000.
Jameel Ahmad, global head of currency strategy and market research at FXTM, said the production cut "is not the ultimate answer".

零售巨头亚马逊表示，它将建立自己的冠状病毒测试实验室，以监控员工的健康状况。
该公司表示，已经组建了一个团队来建立自己的“增量测试能力”。
亚马逊员工此前曾批评该公司对冠状病毒大流行的反应。
3月，亚马逊解雇了一名纽约仓库工人，该工人组织抗议该公司缺乏安全预防措施。
该公司承认测试资源有限，因此它组建了一支员工团队来开发自己的设备。

The company said it had assembled a team to build its own "incremental testing capacity".
Amazon staff have previously criticised the firm over its response to the coronavirus pandemic.
In March, Amazon fired a New York warehouse worker who organised a protest over a lack of safety precautions taken by the company.
The company acknowledged that testing resources were limited, so it had assembled a team of employees to develop its own facility.

芝加哥大学布斯商学院（University of Chicago Booth School of Business）的金融学教授是经济学家，他对西方经济做出了黯淡的预测，因为他希望西方经济将从扩张转向收缩。
“在这一点上，我们可能正在考虑西方国家的GDP增长从约2个百分点转变为3个百分点，再下降为4个或5个百分点。
“每个国家今年至少将损失GDP的5至6个百分点。

Raghuram Rajan said western economies are facing a drop in growth by as much as 6 percentage points this year.
The economist, who is a finance professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, gave a bleak forecast for western economies as he expects them to shift from expansion to contraction.
"At this point, we're probably thinking of western countries seeing a shift in GDP growth from about 2 percentage to 3 percentage points, to negative 4 or 5 percentage points.
"Each country is going to lose 5 to 6 percentage points of GDP at the very least over this year.

随着系列第三季的回归，它似乎比以往任何时候都更具替代性，因此受到更多欢迎。
Villanelle操纵Eve做出了以前无法想象的事情：她砍了斧头，杀害了威胁Villanelle生命的人。
当Villanelle后来告诉夏娃“你是我的人”时，在罗马废墟­的异国情调中宣告了具有多重含义的一行-夏娃拒绝了她。
除其他原因外：她的丈夫尼科（Owen McDonnell）因上个赛季维拉内尔（Villanelle）袭击他而患上PTSD。
★★★★★《杀戮前夕》将于4月12日在美国的BBC America和AMC以及4月13日在英国的BBC iPlayer上首播。

As the series’ third season returns, it seems more of an alternative universe than ever, and more welcome for that.
Villanelle manipulated Eve into doing something previously unthinkable: she took an axe and murdered a man threatening Villanelle’s life.
When Villanelle later told Eve “You’re mine” – a line with multiple meanings, declared in the exotic setting of a Roman ruin ­– Eve rejected her.
Among other reasons: her husband, Niko (Owen McDonnell), is in hospital suffering from PTSD because Villanelle attacked him last season.
★★★★★Killing Eve premieres on 12 April on BBC America and AMC in the US and on BBC iPlayer on 13 April in the UK.

对于其他人而言，情况无异于：在周围的人处处处感到尴尬，and琐的自我怀疑掩盖了每个决定。
如果您属于后一组，您可能会想知道为什么要成为领导者会让您感到恐惧，以及为什么觉得自己很难成为经理。
如果您的父母使紫罗兰萎缩，那么您也同样会增加几率。
关键是父母对您的举止。

You’ve probably noticed how some of your colleagues take to leadership roles like a duck to water.
It couldn’t be more different for others: bossing around people feels awkward, and a nagging self-doubt shadows every decision.
If you’re in the latter group, you might wonder why the thought of being a leader fills you with dread, and why you find it so hard to even see yourself as a manager.
If your parents were shrinking violets, the odds are increased that you will be too.
And key here is the way your parents behaved toward you.

世界各地的其他珊瑚通常不具有相同的生物生存能力。
按照这个速度，到2100年，红海礁石可能是最后的礁石之一。
当Fine和研究小组将硝酸盐，铵盐和磷酸盐等营养物质引入实验时，珊瑚的生理机能受到损害，它们不再具有弹性。
芬说：“仅靠温度是不够的。”
“如果我们要确保亚喀巴湾和北部红海成为珊瑚礁避难所，我们就必须消除当地的压力。”与Fine，Meibom和其他几位科学家和外交官一道，Kleinhaus呼吁联合国教科文组织宣布红海礁作为海洋世界遗产，以帮助确保该礁得以持久存在，并受到保护，免受当地威胁，否则可能会损害珊瑚的复原力。

Other corals around the world don’t typically possess the same biological ability to persist.
At this rate, the Red Sea reefs could be one of the last standing by the year 2100.
When Fine and the team introduce nutrients such as nitrate, ammonium and phosphate into the experiments, the corals’ physiology is compromised and they’re no longer as resilient.
“It’s not enough to be resilient to temperature,” Fine says.
“If we are to secure the Gulf of Aqaba and the northern Red Sea as a coral reef refuge, we have to remove the local stress.”Along with Fine, Meibom, and several other scientists and diplomats, Kleinhaus is calling on Unesco to declare the Red Sea reef as a Marine World Heritage Site, to help ensure that the reef persists and will be protected from local threats that could otherwise compromise the coral’s resilience.

但是，如果您需要一些额外的动力来进行春季大扫除，则可能其中藏有宝藏。
有价值的金属和矿物质被锁在我们积聚在尘土飞扬的角落的旧产品内。
总的来说，我们的房屋和后院是一个“城市矿山”，里面装满了这些等待挖掘的重要材料。
它们中的每一种都包含铜，银甚至金，以及各种有价值的稀土元素。
因此，将其更多地视为将您的ard积物整理成整齐的堆放，以便以后回收的机会。

If you need a little extra motivation for the spring clean, though, there’s probably treasure hidden in there.
Locked inside the old products we hoard in dusty corners are valuable metals and minerals.
Collectively, our homes and backyards are an “urban mine” filled with these essential materials that are just waiting to be dug out.
Each of these contains copper, silver and even gold, along with a wide range of valuable rare earth elements.
So, view this more as an opportunity to sort your hoard into neat piles, for recycling later.

在1945年至1989年之间，波兰各地的城镇和村庄建立了3,000座教堂。
这些教堂既没有法律禁止，也没有被禁止，这些教堂-其中许多看起来像是从外太空到达的，令人大跌眼镜-对于建筑师来说是天赐之物。
“建立一个建筑实践是不可能的，”《天七建筑》（Day-VII Architecture）一书的合著者伊扎贝拉·西乔斯卡（IzabelaCichońska）解释说，这些书对这些教堂进行了分类。
他设计了三座教堂，包括波兰女王格洛夫（Glogów）的圣母玛利亚教堂。
尽管这些教堂中最好的教堂在视觉上大饱眼福，但它们的建筑也许比其设计更为独特。

In towns and villages across Poland, 3,000 churches were built between 1945 and 1989.
Neither legal nor prohibited, these churches – many of them eye-popping edifices that look as if they’ve arrived from outer space – were a godsend for architects.
“It was impossible to set up an architectural practice,” explains Izabela Cichońska, co-author of the book Day-VII Architecture, that catalogues these churches.
He designed three churches including Glogów’s Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Queen of Poland.
Despite the visual feast that the best of these churches represents, their construction is perhaps even more extraordinary than their design.

大约5年前，一个名叫Dean Weber的男人当时正在管理福特的历史档案，他偶然发现了这四张照片，这些照片看起来像是原型中置两座野马的原型。
您会以为福特会记得制造这种东西。
自从韦伯（Weber）于1966年5月发现这些照片以来，福特一直在拼命地寻找一个人，知道这个东西到底是什么。
其中之一就是杰克·特尔纳克（Jack Telnack），他于1958年开始在福特的设计工作室工作，后来成为该公司的全球设计副总裁。
它敦促对这种神秘野马一无所知的人发送电子邮件至ClubHub@Ford.com，以便它可以追踪照片背后的真实故事。

Some five years ago a man called Dean Weber, who at the time ran Ford’s historical archives, came across these four photographs of what appears to be a prototype mid-engined two-seater Mustang.
You’d think Ford would remember building such a thing.
Ever since Weber discovered those photographs, dated May 1966, Ford has been desperately trying to find someone, anyone, who knows what the hell this thing is.
One of those people was Jack Telnack, who started working in Ford’s design studio in 1958 and went on to become the company’s Global Vice President of Design.
It’s urging anyone who knows anything about this mysterious Mustang to email ClubHub@Ford.com, so it can trace the real story behind the photos.
