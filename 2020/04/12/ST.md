香港（路透社）-周日（4月12日），香港人挤满了海滩，渡轮和离岛，其中许多人违反了禁止聚集四人以上以遏制新的冠状病毒传播的规定。
在漫长的复活节周末，湛蓝的天空将人们引到了全美各地的热门地区，其中许多人没有戴口罩。
在过去的几个月中，这座拥有740万人口的城市已戴上口罩。
香港记录了1,005例Covid-19病例，在该市造成4人死亡。
尽管香港，新加坡和台湾一直被作为遏制冠状病毒的榜样，但上周末社会疏远规则的广泛蔑视可能使香港迄今的努力脱轨。

HONG KONG (REUTERS) - People in Hong Kong thronged beaches, ferries and outlying islands on Sunday (April 12), many of them violating a ban on gatherings of more than four people aimed at containing the spread of the new coronavirus.
Clear blue skies lured people to popular areas across the territory over the long Easter weekend, and many of them were without surgical masks.
People in the city of 7.4 million have made a point of wearing masks in the past months.
Hong Kong has recorded 1,005 cases of Covid-19, which has killed four people in the city.
While Hong Kong, along with Singapore and Taiwan, have been held up as examples in their efforts to curb the coronavirus, the widespread flouting of social distancing rules over the weekend threatens to derail the city's efforts so far.

55岁的约翰逊先生于4月5日被送往伦敦市中心的圣托马斯医院，患有由新的冠状病毒引起的持续性疾病症状。
约翰逊先生在离开重症监护室以来的首次评论中，感谢国家卫生服务（NHS）医院的工作人员。
周五的死亡人数为980人，超过了单日最高记录的意大利，这是迄今为止欧洲受灾最严重的国家。
英国官员周日表示，英国承诺提供2亿英镑的援助，以帮助阻止第二次冠状病毒浪潮。仅在英国，死亡人数就上升到9,594人。
卫生部长马特·汉考克（Matt Hancock）在周六接受英国广播公司（BBC）电台采访时建议，英国的每日死亡人数已经超过意大利，因为该国人口众多。

Mr Johnson, 55, was taken to St Thomas’ Hospital in central London on April 5, suffering from persistent symptoms of the disease caused by the new coronavirus.
In his first comments since leaving intensive care, Mr Johnson thanked National Health Service (NHS) hospital staff.
Friday’s death toll of 980 surpassed the highest recorded in a single day in Italy, the hardest hit country in Europe so far.

伦敦（路透社）-英国首相鲍里斯·约翰逊（Boris Johnson）于周日（4月12日）离开医院，并感谢工作人员挽救了Covid-19的性命，但由于全国死亡人数超过10,000人，他的政府被迫捍卫其对冠状病毒爆发的反应。

周五的死亡人数为980人，超过了迄今在欧洲受灾最严重的意大利所记录的最高日总数。

LONDON (REUTERS) – British Prime Minister Boris Johnson left hospital on Sunday (April 12) and thanked staff for saving his life from Covid-19, but his government was forced to defend its response to the coronavirus outbreak as the national death toll passed 10,000.
The sombre milestone came after Britain reported two days in a row of hospital deaths increasing by more than 900.
Friday’s death toll of 980 surpassed the highest daily total recorded in Italy, the hardest-hit country in Europe so far.
Johnson, 55, was taken to St Thomas’ Hospital in London on April 5.
He will continue his recovery at Chequers, the official prime ministerial country residence northwest of London, his office said.

梵蒂冈城（路透社）-教皇方济各星期天（4月12日）呼吁全球团结一致，共同应对冠状病毒大流行及其经济影响，敦促放宽国际制裁，为穷国减免债务和在所有冲突中停火。
他还警告欧洲联盟，如果不同意如何帮助该地区复苏，它可能会崩溃。
弗朗西斯教皇对那些由于限制而无法与亲人告别的人，对于未能领受圣礼的天主教徒以及对未来前景不确定的所有人表示同情。
教宗方济各说：“愿国际制裁放宽，因为这些制裁使施加制裁的国家很难向其公民提供足够的支持。”
意大利总理朱塞佩·孔戴（Giuseppe Conte）的立场与之相呼应，该国遭受的冠状病毒死亡人数最高。

VATICAN CITY (REUTERS) - Pope Francis called on Sunday (April 12) for global solidarity in fighting the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout, urging the relaxation of international sanctions, debt relief for poor nations and ceasefires in all conflicts.
He also warned the European Union that it risked collapse if it did not agree on how to help the region recover.
Pope Francis expressed sympathy for those not able to bid farewell to their loved ones because of restrictions, for Catholics who have not been able to receive the sacraments and for all those worried about an uncertain future.
"May international sanctions be relaxed, since these make it difficult for countries on which they have been imposed to provide adequate support to their citizens," Pope Francis said.
That echoed a position by Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, whose country has suffered one of the highest coronavirus death tolls.

上海（路透社）-在单日进口的冠状病毒病例数创下纪录之后，中国正在加强对入境外国人的审查，并加强边境管制，使每天新发现的感染数量翻了一番。
“进口案件的风险急剧增加，”中国南部经济中心广州市市长温国辉在周日的新闻发布会上说。
该市当局表示，正在加强边境管制，作为防止进口案件的措施的一部分。
它补充说，政府还将封锁发现并确认无症状冠状病毒病例的住宅单位，为期14天。
此外，作为另一个主要的风险来源，新报告的无症状冠状病毒病例从前一天的34例增加到星期六的63例，几乎翻了一番。

SHANGHAI (REUTERS) - China is stepping up scrutiny of inbound foreigners and tightening border control after the number of single-day imported coronavirus cases set a record, helping double the daily number of newly detected infections.
"The risk of imported cases has increased dramatically," Mr Wen Guohui, mayor of Guangzhou, an economic hub in Southern China, told a news conference on Sunday.
The city's authorities said it was strengthening border controls as part of measures to prevent imported cases.
The government will also lock down for 14 days residential units in which confirmed and asymptomatic coronavirus cases are found, it added.
In addition, highlighting another major source of risk, newly reported asymptomatic coronavirus cases nearly doubled to 63 on Saturday, from 34 the previous day.
