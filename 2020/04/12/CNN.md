那是因为当局采取了特殊的封锁措施，以减缓Covid-19病毒在普吉岛的扩散，普吉岛已成为该国的冠状病毒热点。
截至4月10日，共有170例确诊的Covid-19病例，这个拥有40万人口的小岛，在泰国的77个省中，人均感染率最高。
根据政府统计，普吉岛每10万人中有38.95例，曼谷则为21.90 / 10万。
由于发生冠状病毒，该机场目前对所有商业航班都关闭。
他告诉CNN Travel：“我们估计该岛上80％的酒店目前已经关闭或正在关闭。”

That's because authorities have taken extraordinary lockdown measures to slow the spread of the Covid-19 virus in Phuket, which has emerged as the country's coronavirus hotspot.
With 170 confirmed cases of Covid-19 as of April 10, this island of 400,000 or so residents has the highest infection rate per capita out of all of Thailand's 77 provinces.
According to government statistics, there are about 38.95 cases per 100,000 people in Phuket, versus 21.90 per 100,000 in Bangkok.
The airport is currently closed to all commercial flights due to the coronavirus outbreak.
"We have estimated that 80% of all hotels on the island are currently closed or in the process of closing down," he tells CNN Travel.

（CNN）为埃德蒙顿油工队和波士顿熊队效力的NHL中锋科尔比·凯夫（Colby Cave）已死。
埃德蒙顿油工和凯夫的家人在周六早上宣布了这一消息。
据NHL.com称，在多伦多森尼布鲁克医院的医生手术去除胶体囊肿后几天，他就去世了。
他的妻子艾米丽·凯夫（Emily Cave）在一份声明中说，自周一晚上通宵流血以来，他一直处于医学昏迷状态，他的团队说：“很遗憾分享我们今天早晨清早去世的Colby Cave的消息。 “我（艾米丽）和我们两个家庭都感到震惊，但知道我们，他的家人和朋友，整个曲棍球社区以及其他许多人都深深地爱上了科尔比。

我为那些因＃COVID19而失去了嗅觉和味觉的人提供了帮助，我认为它们对我有帮助。
“我现在快两周了，大约70％的嗅觉又恢复了。
芒格说，关于人们是否正在经历嗅觉丧失或味觉丧失的问题归结为对“味”一词的科学或口头使用。
艾米·沃克（Amy Walker）感到自己得了重感冒，并在3月18日失去了嗅觉。
芒格说，耳鼻喉医生有时用来消除可能是由炎症引起的气味的一种疗法是使用鼻类固醇。

I'm making a thread for those who have lost their sense of smell and taste due to \#COVID19 with all the things I've found helpful.
"I'm at almost two weeks now and about 70% of my sense of smell has returned.
The question about whether people are experiencing smell loss or taste loss comes down to the scientific or colloquial use of the word taste, Munger says.
Amy Walker felt like she had come down with a bad cold and lost her sense of smell on March 18.
One of the treatments that ENT doctors sometimes use for smell loss that might come from an inflammatory response is to use nasal steroids, Munger says.

## 在白俄罗斯，Covid-19是现代的切尔诺贝利

切尔诺贝利的字面影响与Covid-19病毒的象征意义影响之间有许多相似之处。
看来白俄罗斯将是一个非常适合切尔诺贝利课程并立即应用的国家。
白俄罗斯似乎尚未-也许永远不会-考虑到切尔诺贝利事件，这在它的当下是回声。
当您问白俄罗斯的老一辈人，他们对苏联政府对切尔诺贝利悲剧的反应有何看法时，他们不会感到震惊或愤怒。
是的，关于切尔诺贝利的HBO系列节目受到了全世界评论家的广泛关注和好评，甚至在俄罗斯和白俄罗斯也是如此。

There are many similarities between the literal fallout of Chernobyl and the figurative fallout of the Covid-19 virus.
It would seem like Belarus would be a country uniquely suited to take the lessons of Chernobyl and apply them today.
It seems that Belarus has not yet -- and maybe never will -- reckon with the events of Chernobyl, and this is echoing in its present.
When you ask the older generation in Belarus what they think about the Soviet government's reaction to the tragedy at Chernobyl, they don't register shock or anger.
Yes, the HBO series on Chernobyl was widely watched and praised by critics around the world, even in Russia and Belarus.

此举是在媒体对所谓的第二次冠状病毒病例的报道日益增加的情况下发生的，这是由中国境外的感染引起的。
但是，当本月在非洲社区出现冠状病毒病例时，它加剧了现有的紧张局势。
该报告在社交媒体上广泛分享，非洲当地人CNN表示对非洲社区的种族主义强烈反对。
由于中国的冠状病毒案件似乎得到控制，他想恢复自己的贸易业务，而这种业务已经被大流行所困扰。
同时，周四有来自中国的非洲人的报道称，对非洲人的镇压范围比广州还大。

The move comes amid heightened media coverage of the so-called second wave of coronavirus cases, emanating from infections outside of China.
But when coronavirus cases emerged in the African community this month it served to amplify existing tensions.
The report was shared widely on social media, and local Africans CNN spoke to say a racist backlash against the African community ​followed.
With China's coronavirus cases seemingly under control, he wanted to resume his trading business, which had been stymied by the pandemic.
Meanwhile, on Thursday reports emerged from Africans in China that the crackdown on Africans is wider than Guangzhou.

伦敦（CNN）达菲（Duffy）透露了四周磨难的惨痛经历，在此期间，她说自己在生日那天在一家餐馆被吸毒，被带到国外并被一名不知名的袭击者强奸。
威尔士歌手在自己网站上的帖子中说，她正在公开细节，以释放自己的情绪负担，并帮助“遭受同样痛苦”的其他人。
“那是我的生日，我在一家餐馆被吸毒，然后我被吸毒了四个星期，然后去了国外。
达菲说，她因“逃离”而逃脱，但没有提供她如何逃跑的细节，并补充说“不记得回家”。
希望不再有“达菲问题发生了什么”，现在您知道了……我自由了。”

London (CNN) Duffy has revealed harrowing details of a four-week ordeal during which she says she was drugged at a restaurant on her birthday, taken to a foreign country and raped by an unnamed attacker.
In a post on her own website , the Welsh singer said she was making the details public in order to free herself of her emotional burden and help others who "have suffered the same."
"It was my birthday, I was drugged at a restaurant, I was drugged then for four weeks and travelled to a foreign country.
Duffy said she escaped by "fleeing" but did not provide details of how she got away, adding she "cannot remember getting home."
Hopefully no more 'what happened to Duffy questions', now you know ... and I am free."

## 世界最高酒店将在迪拜开业

### The world's tallest hotel to open in Dubai ... again

由棕榈树亚特兰蒂斯酒店的创造者NORR建筑师设计，力图使这种高度的价值最大化。
Ciel Tower来自于建筑公司，该公司在迪拜朱美拉棕榈岛上创建了迪拜的标志性亚特兰蒂斯酒店，即棕榈酒店。
该设计在12月的国际房地产奖中获得了三项大奖，分别是最佳国际酒店建筑，最佳阿拉伯酒店建筑和最佳阿拉伯高层建筑。
自2016年以来，迪拜码头（Dubai Marina）的建筑工地一直在进行建筑工作。迪拜码头是一个主要的开发枢纽，设有306米（1,004英尺）的卡扬塔和425米（1,394英尺）的Marina 101建筑的超高层摩天大楼群。
最高酒店的名称通常仅适用于完全用作酒店的建筑物。

The design from architects NORR, creators of the Atlantis, the Palm hotel, seeks to maximize the value of such altitude.
Ciel Tower comes from the architecture firm that created Dubai's iconic Atlantis, the Palm hotel on the man-made island of Palm Jumeirah.
The design won three prizes at the International Property Awards in December, for Best International Hotel Architecture, Best Hotel Architecture Arabia, and Best High-rise Architecture Arabia.
Construction work has been ongoing since 2016 at the building site in Dubai Marina, a major hub of development featuring a cluster of supertall skyscrapers including the 306-meter (1,004 feet) Cayan Tower and 425-meter (1,394 feet) Marina 101 building.
The title of tallest hotel is typically applied only to buildings used wholly as hotels.

The design team were keen to create an iconic landmark that would captivate visitors and encourage them to memorialize the moment - " Instagram ready " as George Legendre and Tim Fu of IJP Architects put it.
IJP Architects/AKT II"We envisioned the bridge as an opportunity for place-making, connecting the city's embankments with the waterside promenade," the architects told CNN in a statement.
There is no current timeline for completion of the bridge - or the record-breaking tower - and much of Emaar's construction work has been put on hold by the coronavirus pandemic.

Muiz和Malik的哥哥是23岁的Babatunde Sanni，负责编辑视频并管理三人组。

伊科罗杜·布瓦（Ikorodu Bois）希望他们有一天能够将自己的才能转移到大银幕上，并成为好莱坞演员。

The Ikorodu Bois -- brothers Muiz Sanni, 15, Malik Sanni, 10, and their 13-year-old cousin Fawas Aina -- have become Instagram sensations by using everyday household items to recreate multimillion-dollar music videos and Hollywood movie trailers, shot by shot.
Muiz and Malik's big brother, 23-year-old Babatunde Sanni, edits the videos and manages the trio.
While their Instagram followers are clearly delighted, what do the boys' parents make of their unusual hobby?
We have a lot of multi-talented kids, a lot of brilliant students," he says.
The Ikorodu Bois are hoping they'll one day be able to transfer their talents to the big screen and make it as Hollywood actors.

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
后来空袭被认为是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

当女孩们反对时，他们说格拉泽会威胁要把他们赶出去。
一些幸存者说，格拉瑟（Glaser）介绍自己是一名医生，但支持起诉的律师告诉美国有线电视新闻网（CNN），他是物理治疗师-不是合格的医生。
Dilen于去年2月在Bery's Place进行的一次警察突袭中因警察的讯问而被捕，后来被释放。
但至少现在，他们说他们开始在贝里故居之外享受生活。

But five women in their late teens and early twenties interviewed by CNN, including Patricia, allege that Glaser sexually and emotionally abused them at Bery's Place.
When the girls objected, they say Glaser would threaten to cast them out on the streets.
Some survivors say Glaser introduced himself as a doctor, but lawyers supporting the prosecution told CNN that he is a physiotherapist -- not a qualified physician.
Dilen was arrested for questioning by police last February during a police raid at Bery's Place, and later released.
But for now, at least, they say they're beginning to enjoy their lives outside of Bery's Place.

我的工厂位于鲤鱼门公园，通常是香港岛东部一个绿树成荫的度假村。
这个假日公园是香港用作冠状病毒检疫中心的几处设施之一。
在此之前，我已经在家工作了三个月-因此，在隔离营中做同样的事情并没有多大区别。
但这证明了香港政府对遏制从海外进口的案件并推回本地自满情绪的重视程度。

Holiday camp turned quarantine campLife in quarantine -- with its regimented meals, temperature checks and PPE-wearing staff -- feels like an odd mix of being in school, at camp, and in prison.
My facility, in Lei Yue Mun Park, is normally a leafy holiday village in the east of Hong Kong Island.
This holiday park is one of several facilities being used as coronavirus quarantine centers in Hong KongSince March, that number has surged.
Prior to now, I'd already been working from home for three months -- so doing the same from a quarantine camp hasn't made much of a difference.
But it's a testament to how serious the Hong Kong government is about clamping down on cases imported from overseas, and pushing back on local complacency.
