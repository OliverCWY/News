If you’re struggling to get fresh herbs and spices (and growing them isn’t an option), turn to jars. While a heartily-filled spice rack can raise the game of all sorts of dishes, you can of course save space and cash by just buying a few key essentials. Mixed herbs will go into lots of savoury dishes, but really add flavour to pasta sauces like this easy spaghetti and meatballs.

Five-spice is of course associated with traditional Chinese dishes like Chinese five-spice spare ribs, but it also creates the perfect base for marinades for other meats or veg. For example these five-spice chicken drumsticks go down a treat. Curry powder will of course help you with any, ahem, curry, like this quick chicken korma.

If you can squeeze them in, these herbs and spices will also go far…

Dried chilli flakes or chilli powder – as the formidable girl group said, Spice Up Your Life\! Yep, these will warm up a dish and make it extra satisfying. We love chilli powder in this vegan chickpea curry, and chilli flakes or powder are brilliant for adding heat to tomato-based pasta sauces, and for livening up all sorts of simple pasta dishes like this bacon and kale pasta.

Cumin powder – great for curries, especially when you have lentils to hand. Cumin can also add depth to other dishes, like this carrot, cumin and barley summer stew.

Smoked paprika – whether you’re making a pasta sauce or roasting potatoes, smoked paprika will give dishes an earthy flavour. It gives an extra tang to this smoked haddock and cauliflower gratin and we love it in this shakshuka traybake.

Ground cinnamon – great for curries and sweet dishes, such as these cinnamon doughnuts with lemon cream or this simple French toast, a jar of cinnamon will go far.

Nutmeg – can be used in lots of dishes, whether that’s a main or pud. But if you’re looking for comfort, it’s hard to beat adding a grating to this slow-cooker rice pudding.
