(CNN) A man has been arrested in Russia on suspicion of shooting and killing five people after asking them not to be so loud during the country's coronavirus lockdown.

The man was arrested over the weekend after having an argument with neighbors while standing on the balcony of his apartment, the Russian Investigative Committee told state news agency TASS.

The alleged incident took place in the village of Yelatma, in the Ryazan region of western Russia. As with most Russian regions, the area has imposed a stay-at-home order for residents as the country battles the coronavirus pandemic.

"Police officers arrived at the scene promptly. A resident of that building born in 1988 was detained by police officers near that building where five bodies were found," the Interior Ministry's regional department told TASS on Sunday. "According to preliminary data, those were four men and one woman."

Standing on the balcony of his apartment, the man allegedly "asked a group of four young men and a girl flocking near the house not to be that loud," TASS added, citing the Russian Investigative Committee.
