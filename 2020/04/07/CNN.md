（CNN）健康专家警告，随着冠状病毒大流行继续蔓延，美国Covid-19死亡人数可能被低估了。
3月份，疾病预防控制中心（CDC）引入了新的代码，以准确记录死亡证明书上Covid-19导致的死亡率。
上周，美国食品和药物管理局（FDA）发布了其首份用于冠状病毒测试的紧急使用授权，该测试可在血液中寻找抗体。
与通常需要拭子并寻找病毒本身迹象的大多数冠状病毒检测不同，抗体检测代替的是寻找人体对病毒的反应。
总统在周六白宫简报会上说：“这可能是本周至下周之间最艰难的一周。”

(CNN) Health experts are warning the national count of Covid-19 deaths in the United States could be underestimated as the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread.
In March, the CDC introduced a new code to accurately capture mortality due to Covid-19 on death certificates.
Last week, The US Food and Drug Administration issued its first emergency use authorization for a coronavirus test that looks for antibodies in the blood.
Unlike most coronavirus tests, which generally require a swab and look for signs of the virus itself, antibody tests look instead for the body's response to a virus.
"This will be probably the toughest week between this week and next week," the President said at a White House briefing Saturday.

澳大利亚布里斯班（CNN）红衣主教乔治·佩尔（George Pell）在澳大利亚高等法院一致推翻他对五项历史性儿童性虐待的定罪后被释放出狱。
周二高等法院的裁决推翻了他对一项儿童性侵罪和四项对儿童进行in亵行为的定罪。
佩尔在狱中发表声明说，他对原告持有“没有恶意”。
在周二高等法院的裁决后，维多利亚州警方发表声明说，这尊重该决定，并将继续支持有关投诉人。
在此之前，2019年2月举行了一次历史性的首脑会议，由教皇召集，以审查教会对儿童性侵犯指控的回应。

Brisbane, Australia (CNN) Cardinal George Pell has been freed from prison after Australia's High Court unanimously overturned his conviction on five counts of historical child sex abuse.
Tuesday's High Court ruling overturns his conviction on one count of sexual penetration of a child and four counts of committing an indecent act with a child.
In a statement released from prison, Pell said he held "no ill will" toward his accuser.
After Tuesday's High Court ruling, Victoria Police issued a statement saying that is respects the decision and will continue to support complainants involved.
It followed a historic summit in February 2019, called by the Pope to examine the church's response to claims of child sexual assault.

伦敦（CNN）达菲（Duffy）透露了为期四周的磨难的惨痛经历，在此过程中，她说自己生日那天在一家饭店里被毒品吸毒，被带到国外并被一名不知名的袭击者强奸。
威尔士歌手在自己网站上的帖子中说，她正在公开细节，以释放自己的情绪负担，并帮助“遭受同样痛苦”的其他人。
“那是我的生日，我在一家餐馆被吸毒，然后被吸毒了四个星期，然后去了国外。
达菲说，她因“逃离”而逃脱，但没有提供她如何逃跑的细节，并补充说“不记得回家”。
希望不再有“达菲问题发生了什么”，现在您知道了……我自由了。”

London (CNN) Duffy has revealed harrowing details of a four-week ordeal during which she says she was drugged at a restaurant on her birthday, taken to a foreign country and raped by an unnamed attacker.
In a post on her own website , the Welsh singer said she was making the details public in order to free herself of her emotional burden and help others who "have suffered the same."
"It was my birthday, I was drugged at a restaurant, I was drugged then for four weeks and travelled to a foreign country.
Duffy said she escaped by "fleeing" but did not provide details of how she got away, adding she "cannot remember getting home."
Hopefully no more 'what happened to Duffy questions', now you know ... and I am free."

我所说的一切都是在匿名的情况下进行的。如果他们不被卡在纽约等高密度地区，所有人都认为他们更适合超越Covid-19。
我认识的一个人每天都把家人的食物赶出纽约市。
受哈佛训练的流行病学家阿什温·瓦桑（Ashwin Vasan）博士告诉我，他听到过富人购买自己的呼吸机的令人不安的故事。
他说：“长岛没有像纽约市那样完善的医疗体系……这使我们非常关切。”
有了Covid-19，我们没有理由认为乡下的人比纽约市的人受到的感染要少。

All I spoke to did so on condition of anonymity; all felt they were better placed to outrun Covid-19 if they were not stuck in high-density areas like New York City.
One person I know has her family's food driven out from New York City every day.
Harvard-trained epidemiologist Dr. Ashwin Vasan told me that he's heard disturbing stories of wealthy individuals procuring their own ventilators.
"Long Island does not have as elaborate a health care system as New York City ... and that has us very concerned," he said.
With Covid-19 there is no reason to think that people in the countryside are any less infected than the people in New York City.

就在几天前，他的妻子布兰迪（Brandy）的冠状病毒检测结果呈阳性，但结果并不多。
追求的另一种途径是首先更好地了解人体的免疫系统对病毒和细菌的反应。
在一些年轻，健康的人中，非常活跃的免疫系统可能会导致大规模的炎症性风暴，使肺和其他器官不堪重负。
在这些情况下，问题不在于免疫系统老化或衰弱，而是在于它运作得很好。
一些前线临床医生推测这就是为什么类固醇（一种免疫系统抑制剂）似乎对某些人有益的原因。

Just a few days earlier, his wife, Brandy, had tested positive for coronavirus , but there wasn't much to it.
Another avenue being pursued is better understanding how your body's immune system responds to viruses and bacteria in the first place.
In some young, healthy people, a very reactive immune system could lead to a massive inflammatory storm that could overwhelm the lungs and other organs.
In those cases, it is not an aged or weakened immune system that is the problem -- it is one that works too well.
Some front line clinicians have speculated that is why steroids, an immune system suppressant, seem to offer benefit in some people.

CNN Travel仅与Henley Passport Index（有时被称为“护照之王”）的创始人ChristianKälin进行了交谈。

“超越我们的控制”，爱尔兰在护照指数上仅排名英国第六位，仅排名第六。

But today, with 93% of the world's population living in countries with coronavirus travel bans , the playing field has been temporarily leveled.
CNN Travel spoke exclusively with Christian Kälin, creator of the Henley Passport Index, who is sometimes known as "The Passport King."
Kalin says it's worth noting that the passport index is an effective but crude tool in comparing geopolitical clout.

'Beyond our control'Ireland is just one place above the UK on the Passport Index, at No 6.

（CNN）一名男子因涉嫌射击和杀害五人，并要求他们在该国的冠状病毒封锁期间不要太大声而被捕。
俄罗斯调查委员会告诉国家新闻社，该男子在周末与邻居发生争执时被捕，当时他站在邻居的公寓阳台上。
与大多数俄罗斯地区一样，随着俄罗斯与冠状病毒大流行作斗争，该地区向居民强加了全屋服务。
内政部地区部门周日对塔斯社说：“ 1988年出生的那栋大楼的居民在那栋大楼附近被警察拘留，发现那里有五具尸体。”
塔斯社援引俄罗斯调查委员会的话说，据称该名男子站在他公寓的阳台上，“向一群四名年轻男子和一个女孩涌入房屋附近喊得不那么吵”。

(CNN) A man has been arrested in Russia on suspicion of shooting and killing five people after asking them not to be so loud during the country's coronavirus lockdown.
The man was arrested over the weekend after having an argument with neighbors while standing on the balcony of his apartment, the Russian Investigative Committee told state news agency TASS.
As with most Russian regions, the area has imposed a stay-at-home order for residents as the country battles the coronavirus pandemic.
A resident of that building born in 1988 was detained by police officers near that building where five bodies were found," the Interior Ministry's regional department told TASS on Sunday.
Standing on the balcony of his apartment, the man allegedly "asked a group of four young men and a girl flocking near the house not to be that loud," TASS added, citing the Russian Investigative Committee.

（CNN）警察说，潜水员已经发现了梅夫·肯尼迪·汤森·麦克基恩的遗体。
潜水和救援队的成员在下午5点31分左右离母亲住所约2.5英里的25英尺深的水中发现了尸体。周一，马里兰州自然资源警察在一份声明中说。
41岁的麦基恩（McKean）和她的8岁儿子吉迪恩（Gideon）星期四晚上失踪。
麦基恩的丈夫戴维·麦基恩（David McKean）表示，当梅夫（Maeve）和基迪恩（Gideon）踢足球时，他们一家人在切萨皮克湾母亲的家中进行自我隔离，其中一个将球踢入了水中。
他在Facebook上令人心碎的帖子中写道：“他们进入了独木舟，只是想找回球，却被风或潮汐以某种方式推入了开放海湾。”

(CNN) The body of Maeve Kennedy Townsend McKean has been found by divers, police said.
Members of a dive and rescue team found the body in 25 feet of water, about 2.5 miles from her mother's residence, around 5:31 p.m. Monday, the Maryland Natural Resources Police said in a statement.
McKean, 41, and her 8-year-old son, Gideon, were last seen Thursday evening .
The family was self-quarantining at her mother's home on the Chesapeake Bay, when Maeve and Gideon were playing kickball and one of them kicked the ball into the water, according to McKean's husband, David McKean.
"They got into a canoe, intending simply to retrieve the ball, and somehow got pushed by wind or tide into the open bay," he wrote in a heartbreaking post on Facebook.

作为香港海洋公园的长期居民，盈盈和乐乐的父母可能即将来临。
动物园官员周一宣布，经过十年的自然交配尝试和“通过试验和学习”，两者终于成功了。
由于冠状病毒的爆发，公园自1月下旬开始对游客关闭。
新闻稿说：“自三月下旬以来，莹莹开始花更多的时间在水中嬉戏，而乐乐一直在其栖息地周围留下气味标记，并在该地区寻找莹莹的气味。”
根据海洋公园的数据，仅约有1800只大熊猫仍留在其自然栖息地中。

Parenthood might be around the corner for Ying Ying and Le Le, which are longtime residents of Ocean Park in Hong Kong.
Zoo officials announced Monday that after 10 years of attempts at natural mating, and "through trial and learning," the two have finally succeeded.
Due to the coronavirus outbreak, the park has been closed to visitors since late January .
"Since late March, Ying Ying began spending more time playing in the water, while Le Le has been leaving scent-markings around his habitat and searching the area for Ying Ying's scent," reads the press release.
There are only around 1,800 giant pandas that remain in their natural habitat, according to Ocean Park.

谷歌和新加坡投资公司淡马锡（Temasek）在2018年的一份报告中将越南的数字经济（每年以超过40％的速度增长）描述为“一条巨龙正在释放”。
越南政府因监视公民和限制言论自由而受到广泛批评。
与世界其他地区一样，无法预测冠状病毒将如何影响该国经济。
作为越南最具活力的初创公司之一，Appota已踏上了发展越南智能手机市场的道路。
他说，越南人拥护新技术，并对未来感到乐观，“这促使他们上网购物。”

A 2018 report by Google and Singaporean investment company Temasek described Vietnam's digital economy -- which is growing at more than 40% a year -- as "a dragon being unleashed."
Vietnam's government has been widely criticized for its surveillance of citizens and restrictions on freedom of speech.
And like the rest of the world, it's impossible to predict how the coronavirus will impact the country's economy.
One of the country's most dynamic startups, Appota has hitched its wagon to the growth of Vietnam's smartphone market.
The Vietnamese embrace new technology and feel optimistic about the future, "which drives them to go online and buy stuff," he says.

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
后来空袭被认为是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

Or Framework是位于俄勒冈州波特兰的一座雄心勃勃的148英尺高的木塔，在去年因成本担忧而被取消之前，该塔被设定为美国最高的木塔。
考虑到在2018年之前，俄勒冈州成为美国第一个允许使用18层木制建筑的州，而在美国，没有任何地方允许任何超过6层的建筑物，这一决定意义重大。
