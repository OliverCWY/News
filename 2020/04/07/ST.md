东京（法新社路透社）-日本首相安倍晋三周二（4月7日）宣布，东京和日本其他六个地区因冠状病毒病例激增而进入为期一个月的紧急状态。
“当我决定担心发生一种严重影响人们生活和经济的局势时...
我宣布进入紧急状态，”安倍晋三说。
这超过了美国总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）制定的刺激计划所占美国产出的11％，以及德国所制定计划所占产出的5％。

TOKYO (AFP, REUTERS) - Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday (April 7) declared a month-long state of emergency in Tokyo and six other parts of the country over a spike in coronavirus cases.
"As I decided that a situation feared to gravely affect people's lives and the economy has occurred...
I am declaring a state of emergency," Mr Abe said.
That exceeds the 11 per cent of US output for the stimulus package laid out by President Donald Trump and 5 per cent of output for Germany’s package.

英国首相鲍里斯·约翰逊（Boris Johnson）为在重症监护中为自己的健康而战，而政府也面临着控制疫情的压力，英国正面临着一场领导层危机，因为它正进入冠状病毒大流行的高峰。
约翰逊先生不断恶化的健康状况加剧了该国面临的困难，因为该国为今后10天的病例上升做准备。
随着约翰逊先生的失职，未经测试的拉布先生现在将需要掌握政府机构，并协调流行病应对措施。
约翰逊先生于3月27日透露，他的冠状病毒检测结果呈阳性，正在唐宁街的公寓中被隔离。
在Raab先生宣布自从上周六以来两人都没有发表讲话后，记者就Johnson先生的病情提出了疑问。

LONDON (BLOOMBERG) - Britain is facing a leadership crisis as it heads into the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson fighting for his health in intensive care and his government under pressure to get a grip on the outbreak.
Mr Johnson's deteriorating health intensifies the difficulties facing the country as it prepares for cases to climb over the next 10 days.
With Mr Johnson out of action, the untested Mr Raab will now need to get a grip on the government machine and coordinate the pandemic response.
Mr Johnson revealed on March 27 that he had tested positive for coronavirus and was going into isolation in his Downing Street apartment.
Reporters raised questions over how seriously ill Mr Johnson was after Mr Raab disclosed that the pair had not spoken since last Saturday.

雅加达（雅加达邮报/亚洲新闻网）-当局周一（4月6日）表示，印尼首都雅加达已经成立了一个特别警察部门，以保护因害怕居民可能试图阻止丧礼而担心的冠状病毒受害者的埋葬。
一支由120人组成的强大雅加达小组在周末启动，将监视受害者的尸体，将他们的尸体从医院带到这座庞大城市中的两座墓地，那里的病毒尸体被用塑料包裹并迅速掩埋。
他补充说，任何阻碍医务人员或干扰墓葬的人都可能面临长达一年的监禁。
但是，如果他们不停止行动，我们将采取坚定的行动，将他们带到派出所。”
乔科（Jokowi）在周一的一次有限会议上说：“我要求对高危人群，医生及其家属，接受监视的人以及受监视的患者进行PCR和快速检测。”

JAKARTA (THE JAKARTA POST/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Indonesia's capital Jakarta has launched a special police unit to guard the burials of coronavirus victims over concerns that scared residents could try to block funerals, the authorities said on Monday (April 6).
Launched at the weekend, the 120-strong Jakarta team will watch over victims' bodies as they are taken from hospitals to two cemeteries in the sprawling city, where virus corpses are being wrapped in plastic and quickly buried.
Anyone blocking medical staff or interfering with burials could face up to a year in jail, he added.
But if they don't stop then we'll take firm action and bring them to the police station," he said.
"I have asked for people at high risk, doctors and their families, people under monitoring and patients under surveillance be prioritised in the PCR and rapid testing," Mr Joko, better known as Jokowi, said during a limited meeting on Monday.

马尼拉-总统罗德里戈·杜特尔特（Rodrigo Duterte）扩大了对菲律宾北部三分之一地区的为期一个月的封锁，菲律宾北部该国一半人口居住，因为这里的专家尚未确定冠状病毒大流行的全部影响。
他重申，在整个吕宋岛禁闭行动三周后，要判断菲律宾是否已经“拉平曲线”还为时过早。
政府的经济计划机构警告说，由于封锁，至少有一百万工人可能失业。
除其他外，它将向1800万低收入家庭提供5,000比索至8,000比索的补贴。
杜特尔特先生随后警告违规者，他的锁定措施可能会因造成麻烦而被枪杀。

MANILA - President Rodrigo Duterte has extended a sweeping, month-long lockdown over the northern third of the Philippines, where half the country's population live, as experts here have yet to ascertain the full impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
He reiterated that it was still too early to tell if the Philippines was already "flattening the curve", three weeks into the Luzon-wide lockdown.
The government's economic planning agency has warned that at least a million workers could lose their jobs because of the lockdown.
Among other things, it will provide 5,000 pesos to 8,000 pesos in subsidies to 18 million low-income families.
Mr Duterte later warned violators of his lockdown measures that they could be shot for causing trouble.

新德里（路透社）-政府在一份声明中说，印度是世界上主要的仿制药主要供应国，已取消了对24种药品及其制成药品的出口限制。
由于冠状病毒的爆发扰乱了全球供应链，上个月它施加了限制。
3月3日，印度限制了26种成分和药品的出口。
26种活性药物成分和药品占印度全部药品出口的10％，其中包括几种抗生素，例如替硝唑和红霉素，激素黄体酮和维生素B12。
特朗普周一晚些时候在华盛顿说，印度可能因禁止出口羟氯喹的决定而受到报复。

NEW DELHI (REUTERS) - India, the world's main supplier of generic drugs, has lifted restrictions on the export of 24 pharmaceutical ingredients and medicines made from them, the government said in a statement.
It had imposed the restrictions last month as the coronavirus outbreak disrupted global supply chains.
India had restricted the exports of 26 ingredients and medicines on March 3.
The 26 active pharmaceutical ingredients and medicines accounted for 10 per cent of all Indian pharmaceutical exports and includes several antibiotics, such as tinidazole and erythromycin, the hormone progesterone and Vitamin B12.
Mr Trump said late on Monday in Washington that India could face retaliation for its decision to ban exports of hydroxychloroquine.

华盛顿（法新社）-总统唐纳德·特朗普周一（4月6日）宣布与美国制造业巨头3M达成一项协议，将在对外分配纠纷后提供数百万个口罩，以对抗冠状病毒大流行。
他说：“我们已经与3M达成了非常友好的协议，每月将再交付5550万个高质量的口罩。”
“在接下来的几个月中，我们将为我们的一线医护人员提供1.665亿口罩，因此3M传奇结束得非常愉快。”
一些批评家指责3M不爱国行为，因为它继续向其他国家出售N95防毒口罩。
该公司表示将继续向加拿大和拉丁美洲出售口罩。

WASHINGTON (AFP) - President Donald Trump on Monday (April 6) announced a deal with US manufacturing giant 3M to provide millions of face masks to combat the coronavirus pandemic after a dispute over foreign distribution.
"We have reached a very amicable agreement with 3M for the delivery of an additional 55.5 million high quality face masks each month," he said.
"We're going to be getting over the next couple of months 166.5 million masks for our frontline healthcare workers, so the 3M saga ends very happily."
Some critics accused 3M of unpatriotic behaviour because it continued to sell N95 respirator masks to other countries.
The company said it would continue to sell masks to Canada and Latin America.

吉隆坡（彭博社，星空/亚洲新闻网）-马来西亚和新加坡正在讨论马来西亚公民从共和国返回自己的祖国的新条款，这将在马来西亚国防部长周二（4月7日）宣布。 Ismail Sabri Yaakob在周一（4月6日）说。
外交部在回应媒体询问时说：“新加坡政府目前没有要求以非临床理由擦拭离开新加坡的外国人。”
吉隆坡没有对通过吉隆坡国际机场等进入马来西亚的其他人施加类似的测试要求，也没有在外国工人返乡之前对该国的外国工人进行测试。
他说：“我相信外交部将在明天（星期二）的会议上向我们通报马来西亚和新加坡商定的新条件。”
伊斯梅尔·萨布里（Ismail Sabri）先生说：“但目前，我们不允许新加坡的马来西亚人返回。”他补充说，成千上万的马来西亚人正在设法返回。

KUALA LUMPUR (BLOOMBERG, THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Malaysia and Singapore are discussing new terms for the return of Malaysian citizens from the Republic to their home country, which will be announced as soon as Tuesday (April 7), Malaysian Defence Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said on Monday (April 6).
“There is currently no requirement by the Government of Singapore for foreigners exiting Singapore to be swabbed for non-clinical grounds,” the ministry said in response to media queries.
Kuala Lumpur does not impose a similar testing requirement on others entering Malaysia, such as via Kuala Lumpur International Airport, nor does it test foreign workers in the country before they return home.
“I believe that the Foreign Ministry will inform us at the meeting tomorrow (Tuesday) on what are the new conditions agreed upon by Malaysia and Singapore,” he said.
“But for now, we won’t allow Malaysians in Singapore to return,” said Mr Ismail Sabri, adding that there were tens of thousands of Malaysians seeking to make their way back.

在一项一致裁定中，高等法院裁定，佩尔审判中的陪审团“应该对红衣主教佩尔的罪行感到怀疑”。
佩尔的第一次审判在悬而未决的陪审团中结束，在第二次审判的陪审团一致认为他于2018年有罪之前。
在澳大利亚的法院体系下，他的第一次上诉是在维多利亚州的一家法院进行的，在该法院，反对一个的两名法官中的大多数人维持了他的信念。
弗朗西斯教皇表示，只有在佩尔用尽所有上诉途径后，他才会对此案发表评论。
尽管性虐待受害者及其拥护者对教会施加压力，但他仍然是枢机主教。

In a unanimous ruling, the High Court found that the jury in Pell’s trial “ought to have entertained a doubt” as to Cardinal Pell’s guilt.
Pell’s first trial ended in a hung jury, before the jury in a second trial unanimously found him guilty in 2018.
Under Australia’s court system, his first appeal went to a court in Victoria, where a majority of two judges against one upheld his conviction.
Pope Francis has said he would only comment on the case after Pell exhausted all avenues of appeal.
He has remained a cardinal despite pressure on the church from victims of sexual abuse and their advocates to dismiss him.

日内瓦（法新社）-随着Covid-19成为全球头条新闻，世界卫生组织（WHO）在周二（4月7日）警告说，世界需要近600万护士。
该报告敦促各国查明护理人员的差距，并在护理教育，工作和领导能力上进行投资。
卡顿说，意大利有23名护士死亡，并援引数字表明，全世界约有100名卫生工作者死亡。
他同时表示，有报道称意大利有9％的卫生工作者被感染，“我们现在听说西班牙的感染率高达14％”。
男性招募除Covid-19之外，沃特金斯说，许多较富裕的国家不能提供足够的护士来满足其自己的医疗保健需求，因此依赖移民，加剧了较贫穷国家的短缺。

GENEVA (AFP) - As Covid-19 captures global headlines, the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned on Tuesday (April 7) that the world needs nearly six million nurses.
The report urged countries to identify gaps in their nursing workforce and invest in nursing education, jobs and leadership.
Catton said that 23 nurses had died in Italy and cited figures suggesting that around 100 health workers had died around the world.
Meanwhile he said there were reports of nine percent of health workers being infected in Italy and "we're now hearing of rates of infections up to 14 percent in Spain".
MALE RECRUITMENTBeyond Covid-19, Watkins said many wealthier countries were not producing enough nurses to meet their own healthcare needs, and were therefore reliant on migration, exacerbating shortages in poorer countries.

There were 32 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus on Monday, down from 39 cases a day earlier.
All of the 32 confirmed cases involved travellers arriving from overseas, compared with 38 imported cases a day earlier.

The decline in Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest living structure, is accelerating, exacerbated by record sea temperatures, a leading coral scientist concluded after an extensive aerial survey.
The survey results confirm earlier indications that large parts of the reef had suffered a third mass coral bleaching event in five years.
