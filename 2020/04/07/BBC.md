在他的冠状病毒症状恶化后，总理鲍里斯·约翰逊（Boris Johnson）在伦敦市中心的一家医院度过了一夜的重症监护。
在今天只获得了很少的信息之后，总理在BST 19:00左右接受了重症监护。
为了预防这种疾病，他已被转入重症监护室作为预防措施。
接受Covid-19重症监护的患者中，约有三分之二在到达后24小时内需要镇静和通气。
向约翰逊先生发送信息的人当中，工党领袖基尔·史塔默爵士（Sir Keir Starmer）将其形容为“极为不幸的消息”。

After very, very little information was shared today, the prime minister was taken into intensive care at around 19:00 BST.
And he has been moved to intensive care as a precaution in case he needs ventilation to get through this illness.
Around two-thirds of patients admitted to intensive care with Covid-19 will need sedation and ventilation within 24 hours of arriving.
Among those who have sent messages to Mr Johnson was Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who described it as "terribly sad news".

尽管占人口的30％，黑人芝加哥人占该市所有冠状病毒病例的一半，并导致超过70％的死亡。
周一，纽约市官员说，截至4月5日，芝加哥4,680例确诊的Covid-19病例中，有1,824例是黑人居民。
市长洛里·莱特富特（Lori Lightfoot）说，冠状病毒正在“摧毁黑色芝加哥”。
数据显示，白人居民约占密歇根州记录病例的23％，死亡人数的28％。
路易斯安那州约40％的冠状病毒死亡都发生在新奥尔良地区，那里的居民多数是黑人。

Black Chicagoans account for half of all coronavirus cases in the city and more than 70% of deaths, despite making up 30% of the population.

特朗普于周日致电印度总理纳伦德拉·莫迪（Narendra Modi），该国禁止出口其大量生产的羟氯喹。
当地媒体说，政府正在“考虑”特朗普的要求，预计将于周二做出决定。
两位领导人友好相处，特朗普先生最近高调访问了印度。
羟氯喹甚至能对抗冠状病毒吗？
但是现在看来，政府可能正在重新考虑这一立场，可能是在特朗普先生致电莫迪之后。

Mr Trump had called India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday, a day after the country banned the export of hydroxychloroquine, which it manufactures in large quantities.
Local media said the government was "considering" Mr Trump's request and a decision is expected on Tuesday.
The two leaders are on friendly terms and Mr Trump had made a high-profile trip to India recently.
And does hydroxychloroquine even work against the coronavirus?
But now it seems the government could be reconsidering this stance, possibly following Mr Trump's call to Mr Modi.

超越反应经典的心理学研究表明，有些人自然比其他人更擅长于反身反应。
这一发现可能有助于我们理解为什么有些人比其他人更容易受到假新闻的影响。
像Pennycook这样的研究人员使用一种称为“认知反射测试”或CRT的工具来衡量这种趋势。
那是很多人给出的直观答案，但是正确的答案当然是艾米丽。
认知上的苦难使我们容易受到许多认知偏见的影响，而且似乎也改变了我们消费信息（和错误信息）的方式。

Override reactionsClassic psychological research shows that some people are naturally better at overriding their reflexive responses than others.
This finding may help us understand why some people are more susceptible to fake news than others.
Researchers like Pennycook use a tool called the “cognitive reflection test” or CRT to measure this tendency.
That’s the intuitive answer that many people give – but the correct answer is, of course, Emily.
Cognitive miserliness renders us susceptible to many cognitive biases, and it also seems to change the way we consume information (and misinformation).

“我们有点天真，认为这只会持续两周，”拉卢克说。
不过，拉卢克说，她希望他们愿意尝试同居赌博，并说她能理解为什么其他新婚夫妇决定着手研究新事物。
然而，其他人可能会“否认”他们的真实感受，他们选择了“他们认识的在正常情况下不应该第四次约会的人”。
但是隆德奎斯特（Lundquist）认为，在当前的形势下，与不合适的长期合作伙伴搭档不一定是一件坏事。
他说：“我认为，对于许多人来说，孤立非常可怕……所以每个人都需要做自己想做的事情来解决这个问题。”

“We were a bit naive thinking it would only last two weeks,” says Laluque.
However, Laluque says she wishes they’d taken the gamble of trying out cohabiting and says she can understand why other new couples decided to rush into things.
Others, however, may be “in denial” about their true feelings, having settled for “someone they knew under normal circumstances they shouldn't have gone on a fourth date with”.
But Lundquist believes shacking up with an unsuitable long-term partner isn’t necessarily a bad thing in the current climate.
“I think for many, isolation is pretty terrifying... so everybody needs to do what they need to do to get through this,” he says.

世界如何关闭至少可以说，全世界应对冠状病毒的方法广泛。
来自位置技术专家TomTom的拥堵数据显示，在正式采取锁定措施之前，全球主要城市已经开始逐渐减少繁忙。
在东京，尚未进行官方封锁，但自三月初以来学校已经关闭。
在爆发疫情的武汉，交通水平与去年相比仍接近零。
我们的工作方式随着国家关闭，许多工人不得不试图在家中继续他们的办公室工作。

How the world shut downThe approaches to dealing with coronavirus across the world have been wide-ranging to say the least.
Major cities around the world were already becoming steadily less busy before official lockdown measures came in, congestion data from location technology specialists TomTom shows.
In Tokyo there hasn't been an official lockdown yet, but schools have been shut since the beginning of March.
In Wuhan, where the outbreak originated, traffic levels are still next to zero compared with last year.
How we're workingAs countries have shut down, many workers have had to try to continue their office jobs from home.

美国一家主要的汽车保险公司正在向冠状病毒封锁期间困在家里的客户退款数百万美元。
美国第四大汽车保险公司Allstate表示，将向客户返还总计6亿美元（4.9亿英镑）。
另一家保险公司American Family Mutual也向客户退款，支票总额为2亿美元。
隔离区的司机将获得退款，而大多数客户将获得4月和5月月度保费的15％折扣。
退款可能会给全球其他汽车保险公司施加压力，原因是驾驶人数减少，尤其是现在在家工作的通勤者。

Allstate, the country's fourth biggest car insurer, said it would give back $600m (£490m) in total to customers.
Another insurer, American Family Mutual, is also refunding customers, with cheques totalling $200m.
Drivers in quarantine will receive refunds, while most customers will be given a 15% discount on monthly premiums for April and May.
The refunds could put pressure on other car insurers globally to make refunds due to a drop in driving, particularly due to commuters now working from home.

汽油的价格与石油的批发价格有联系，但它是由竞争驱动的。
RAC的数据显示，本月英国汽油价格下跌了12年来最大幅度。
然而，机管局报告说，在北爱尔兰和伯明翰附近的少数几个加油站，油价跌至每升1英镑以下。
降价正在触及利润，由于冠状病毒关闭，他们目前的汽油销售量要少得多。
汽油零售商协会（PRA）警告说，由于燃料销售枯竭且其业务无法生存，许多加油站将在未来几周内关闭。

While the price of petrol is linked to the wholesale price of oil, it is competitively driven.
UK petrol prices fell by their largest margin in 12 years during the month, according to the RAC.
However, the AA reported seeing the price fall below £1 a litre at a handful of petrol stations, in Northern Ireland and one near Birmingham.
The price cuts are hitting their margins and they are currently selling much less petrol because of the coronavirus shutdown.
The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) has warned that many petrol stations will have to close in the coming weeks, as sales of fuel dry up and their businesses become unviable.

But she says she will have to pay as "it's impossible" to get a full time nursery place where she lives.
"Quite simply put, if the parents don't contribute something towards nursery fees, we would have to close.
She said she had offered waivers to struggling parents, but almost all the parents who were still earning continued to support the nursery.

已经有近500家试图开业的电影院在收到政府的来信后再次关闭。
电影制片厂做出的反应是，将最近才在电影院上映的电影放到网上，这加剧了电影院所有者的痛苦。
电影院如何应对过去的大流行一百年前，甚至现在，人们都担心电影院会被病毒永久关闭。
至关重要的是，制片厂洛杉矶的家园受到严重影响，加利福尼亚的电影院关闭了七个星期。
自从在过去的几个月中冠状病毒在世界范围内传播以来，电影院已经关闭，而不是像1918年那样零散，临时地关闭。

Already, the almost 500 cinemas that tried to open have shut down again after receiving a letter from the government.
Compounding the misery for cinema owners is the fact that film studios have responded by putting films only very recently released in cinemas online.
How cinemas dealt with a past pandemicA century ago, there was even the worry, as there is now, that cinemas would be permanently shut down by a virus.
Critically, the home of the studios, Los Angeles, was severely affected and cinemas in California closed for seven weeks.
Since the coronavirus has spread across the world over the last couple of months, cinemas have closed, not in the patchy, ad-hoc fashion of 1918, but all at once.

对于其他人而言，情况无异于：在周围的人处处处感到尴尬，and琐的自我怀疑掩盖了每个决定。
如果您属于后一组，您可能会想知道为什么要成为领导者会让您感到恐惧，以及为什么觉得自己很难成为经理。
如果您的父母使紫罗兰萎缩，那么您也同样会增加几率。
关键是父母对您的举止。

You’ve probably noticed how some of your colleagues take to leadership roles like a duck to water.
It couldn’t be more different for others: bossing around people feels awkward, and a nagging self-doubt shadows every decision.
If you’re in the latter group, you might wonder why the thought of being a leader fills you with dread, and why you find it so hard to even see yourself as a manager.
If your parents were shrinking violets, the odds are increased that you will be too.

我们DNA中的偏执狂是否仍是我们对必要时回到“另一种”方式的恐惧的残余？
彼得，现年71岁，达林顿一世，铅笔，虽然我看上去很简单，但值得您惊奇和敬畏……如果您能够意识到我所象征的奇迹，便可以帮助拯救人类如此不幸地失去的自由。
正如上面引用的精彩论文《 I-Pencil》所描述的，甚至看似简单的物体（例如石墨铅笔）也来自世界各地成千上万的手。
如果我们完全诚实的话，我们所有人中可能都存在一些仇外心理，种族主义，性别歧视和偏执狂。
对于我们担心与我们不同的其他人（仇外心理）和他们的观点不宽容（偏执），这也是正确的。

Is bigotry in our DNA, a remnant of our fear of “the other” way back when that was necessary?
Peter, 71, DarlingtonI, Pencil, simple though I appear to be, merit your wonder and awe … if you can become aware of the miraculousness which I symbolise, you can help save the freedom mankind is so unhappily losing.
Even seemingly simple objects like a graphite pencil are the work of thousands of hands from around the world, as the wonderful essay I-Pencil, quoted above, describes.
If we are completely honest, there is perhaps a little bit of xenophobia, racism, sexism and bigotry deep within all of us.
This is also true for our fear of others who are different to us – xenophobia – and intolerance of their viewpoints – bigotry.

如果您在努力获取新鲜的药草和香料（并且不能种植），请使用广口瓶。
虽然充满热情的香料架可以提高各种菜肴的吸引力，但您当然可以通过购买一些关键必需品来节省空间和现金。
混合草药会进入很多美味的菜肴，但实际上会为这种意大利面条酱增添风味，例如这种简单的意大利面条和肉丸。
咖喱粉当然可以帮助您解决任何咖喱咖喱，例如这款速食鸡科尔马。
如果您可以将它们挤进去，这些草药和香料也将有用处……干辣椒片或辣椒粉–就像可怕的女孩子们说的那样，香料生活！

If you’re struggling to get fresh herbs and spices (and growing them isn’t an option), turn to jars.
While a heartily-filled spice rack can raise the game of all sorts of dishes, you can of course save space and cash by just buying a few key essentials.
Mixed herbs will go into lots of savoury dishes, but really add flavour to pasta sauces like this easy spaghetti and meatballs.
Curry powder will of course help you with any, ahem, curry, like this quick chicken korma.
If you can squeeze them in, these herbs and spices will also go far…Dried chilli flakes or chilli powder – as the formidable girl group said, Spice Up Your Life\!
