世卫组织总干事特德罗斯·阿丹诺姆·格布雷耶苏斯（Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus）呼吁团结一致，并制止全球卫生危机的“政治化”，特别敦促中美两国表现出“诚实的领导”。
特德罗斯（Tedros）表示，他希望美国的资金将继续得到传统的两党支持。
根据美国数据，美国在2019年向世卫组织捐款超过4亿美元（5.7亿新元），几乎是第二大国家捐助者的两倍。
世卫组织网站显示，美国是其最大的捐助国，占预算的近15％。
他补充说：“如果我们不守规矩，我们面前会有很多行李袋。”

WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for unity and a halt to “politicisation” of the global health crisis, specifically urging China and the United States to show “honest leadership”.
Tedros said that he expected US funding to continue with traditional bipartisan support.
US contributions to the WHO in 2019 exceeded US$400 million (S$570 million), almost double the second largest country donor, according to US figures.
The WHO website shows the United States as its top donor, contributing nearly 15 per cent of the budget.
“We will have many body bags in front of us if we don’t behave,” he added.

拜登赞扬桑德斯离开后，并承诺将他的想法纳入白宫竞选。
相关故事乔·拜登（Joe Biden）从事业的曙光onto升到了最大舞台。一些盟友鼓励桑德斯（Sanders）参加比赛，以进一步影响拜登（Biden）的政策立场。
一些民主党人谴责桑德斯在他2016年与希拉里·克林顿（Hillary Clinton）的比赛中停留太久，伤害了她对特朗普的大选竞标。
特朗普向桑德斯的支持者表示了欢迎，并表示参议员受到民主党的不公平对待，他在推特上迅速做出了反应。
特朗普的竞选经理布拉德·帕斯卡尔（Brad Parscale）在一份声明中说：“由于伯尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sanders）暂停竞选活动，民主党官员在乔·拜登那里找到了他们想要的候选人，这几乎是官方的。”

Biden praised Sanders after his departure and promised his ideas would be incorporated into his White House run.

Some Democrats blame Sanders for staying in his 2016 race against Hillary Clinton too long, hurting her general election bid against Trump.
Trump, who has courted Sanders supporters and said the senator was treated unfairly by the Democratic Party, reacted quickly on Twitter.
“With Bernie Sanders suspending his campaign, it’s all but official that the Democrat establishment got the candidate they wanted in Joe Biden,” Brad Parscale, Trump’s campaign manager, said in a statement.

伦敦（路透社）-财政部长里希·苏纳克（Rishi Sunak）周三（4月8日）表示，由于约翰逊仍在重症监护与Covid-19作战，英国首相鲍里斯·约翰逊（Boris Johnson）的病情正在改善，他能够坐卧并与临床工作人员接触。
约翰逊周日晚上因持续的高温和咳嗽入院圣托马斯医院，并于周一转入重症监护室。
桑纳克在政府日常冠状病毒新闻发布会上说：“医院最新消息是总理仍处于重症监护病房，病情正在改善。”
他仍在重症监护室，”它说。

LONDON (REUTERS) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s condition is improving and he is able to sit up in bed and engage with clinical staff, finance minister Rishi Sunak said on Wednesday (April 8) as Johnson remained in intensive care battling Covid-19.
Johnson was admitted to St Thomas’ hospital on Sunday evening with a persistent high temperature and cough and was transferred to intensive care on Monday.
“The latest from the hospital is that the prime minister remains in intensive care where his condition is improving,” Sunak said at a daily government coronavirus news conference.
He remains in intensive care,” it said.
Britain’s uncodified constitution, a collection of sometimes ancient and contradictory precedents, offers no clear, formal “Plan B” if a prime minister is incapacitated.

官员们正在使城市居民熟悉新措施，例如在公共场所张贴横幅。

JAKARTA - The large-scale social distancing measures to be implemented in Jakarta from Friday (April 10) will be binding for its residents, with gatherings limited to five people and ramped up police patrols to enforce compliance by the public.
However, eight sectors providing essential services, including health, food, energy, logistics and finance, will remain in operation.
The measures, most of which were already put in place after the capital declared a state of emergency on March 20, will now be mandatory for Jakarta residents, with penalties for defiance.
He added that the provincial government will distribute social aid, including staple food, to the poor and vulnerable population.
Officials are familiarising city residents with the new measures, such as by putting up banners in public spaces.

到昨天，进口病例为983例，总感染人数达到81,740人。
然而，现在人们担心在中国，来自进口病例的第二波感染。
自上周以来，卫生当局屈服于公众压力，现在正在其每日报告中披露该国无症状病例的数量。
卫生委员会说，自国家卫生委员会从4月1日开始发布数字以来，平均每天有66例新的无症状病例报告，并且有1000多例无症状病例在医学观察下。
习主席还说，北京将“暂时或可能很长时间”将遏制进口案件作为头等大事。

By yesterday, the number of imported cases stood at 983, while the overall number of people infected hit 81,740.
There are now fears, however, of a second wave of infection in China from imported cases.
The health authorities bowed to public pressure and are now disclosing the number of asymptomatic cases in the country in its daily report since last week.
There has been an average of 66 new cases of asymptomatic cases reported a day since the National Health Commission began releasing the figures from April 1, and more than 1,000 asymptomatic cases under medical observation, says the health commission.
President Xi also said Beijing would make curbing imported cases its top priority "for the time being and maybe for a long period of time".

## 冠状病毒：家庭暴力受害者的人数上升，对他们而言，家不是一个安全的地方

这些案件引起人们对日本乃至全球家庭暴力的担忧，因为人们被要求留在家中，以制止冠状病毒的传播。
目前尚无日本的即时数字。日本首相安倍晋三周二表示，他“未收到任何有关家庭暴力在国内激增的报道或迹象”。
“我们需要保持警惕，我们希望所有受害者立即报告任何虐待家庭或儿童的案件。”
国家警察局上个月的数据显示，家庭暴力案件已经连续16年上升，并在去年再创历史新高。
同时，去年总共进行了82207次家庭暴力咨询，增加了4725例。

These cases raise concerns about domestic violence in Japan - and around the world - as people are asked to stay home to slam the brakes on the spread of the coronavirus.
No immediate figures were available for Japan, whose Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Tuesday that he "has not received any reports or indications" that domestic violence was surging domestically.
"We need to be vigilant, and we want all victims to report any cases of domestic or child abuse immediately."
Already, the number of cases of domestic violence has risen for 16 straight years and set another new high last year, National Police Agency data showed last month.
Meanwhile, there were 82,207 consultations for domestic violence in total last year, an increase of 4,725 cases.
