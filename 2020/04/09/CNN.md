唐纳德·特朗普总统在白宫冠状病毒应对协调员黛博拉·伯克斯博士（Deborah Birx）于4月8日星期三在华盛顿白宫的詹姆斯·布雷迪新闻发布会上发表讲话时说。
亚历克斯·布兰登/ AP博士白宫冠状病毒反应协调员黛博拉·伯克斯（Deborah Birx）表示，由于美国人已经彻底改变了自己的行为，预测美国人死于冠状病毒的人数的模型近来急剧下降。
伯克斯说，美国的表现“在许多情况下比其他几个国家要好得多，我们正在努力理解这一点。”
全国最大的传染病专家安东尼·福西（Anthony Fauci）博士后来表示，不断变化的模式证明了社会疏远步骤正在奏效。
根据新的分析，尽管预计美国仍将面临约16,000张病床的短缺，但它将需要的床位数比以前预期的少168,000张。

President Donald Trump listens as Dr. Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response coordinator, speaks about the coronavirus in the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House on Wednesday, April 8, in Washington.
Alex Brandon/APDr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said models projecting the number of American deaths from coronavirus have dropped dramatically in recent days because Americans have drastically changed their behavior.
Birx said the US was doing "much better in many cases than several other countries, and we're trying to understand that."
The nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, later said the changing models proved that social distancing steps are working.
While the US is still expected to face a shortage of about 16,000 hospital beds, it will need 168,000 fewer beds than previously expected, according to the new analysis.

但是当唐在3月13日被裁员时，她不仅失去了收入来源，还失去了签证身份。
由于冠状病毒危机，美国移民的工作签证面临不确定性。
“我从未见过如此多的签证持有人丢掉工作，”驻纽约的移民律师曹颖（Ying Cao）说，他的客户主要是中国侨民。
“我的许多持工作签证的客户都很担心。”
他在美国处于毕业后宽限期，这使他无需工作签证即可停留一年。

But when Tang was made redundant on March 13, she didn't just lose her source of income -- she lost her visa status.
Immigrants in the US have faced uncertainty over their work visas due to the coronavirus crisis.
"I've never seen so many visa holders losing their jobs," said Ying Cao, a New York-based immigration lawyer whose clients are mostly Chinese expats.
"A lot of my clients who are here on work visas are extremely concerned."
He is in the US on a post-graduation grace period, which allows him to stay without a work visa for a year.

“国内旅行是恢复健康的第一步。
Trip.com的数据显示，大约61％的中国旅客表示他们准备在八月份再次旅行。
虽然较短的国内旅行可能会启动中国的旅行复兴，但国际旅行可能不会太落后。
的确，对在中国旅行的重新渴望标志着回到现状，而不是旅行习惯的急剧变化。
“我认为该客户首先会选择短期国内旅行，以及区域出境旅行。”

"Domestic travel is the first step toward recovery.
According to Trip.com, roughly 61% of Chinese travelers surveyed indicated that they would feel ready to travel again by August.
While shorter domestic trips may kick start the travel resurgence in China, international travel is likely not too far behind.
Indeed, a renewed desire to travel within China signals a return to the status quo, rather than a dramatic shift in travel habits.
"I think this clientele will choose short domestic trips at first, as well as regional outbound trips."

但是Sears，JCPenney和其他人可能无法幸免于冠状病毒危机。
在大流行期间，商店被关闭。
根据消费者需求停滞的时间长短，公司可能被迫解雇工人，永久关闭商店或进行重组。
面对失业率下降，许多人被迫关闭商店，即使失业率达到50年来的最低点。

New York (CNN Business) They were once the giants of American retail, strong enough to survive wars, the Great Depression, the Great Recession and the rise of online shopping.
But Sears, JCPenney and others may not be able to survive the coronavirus crisis.
During the pandemic, stores have been shuttered.
Depending on how long consumer demand stalls, companies may be forced to lay off workers, close stores permanently or restructure.
Many were forced to close stores in the face of declining sales even as unemployment reached a 50-year low.

（CNN）工人们在本周早些时候在英国的一条铁路上进行建筑施工时发现了一个14世纪的洞穴和素描，这为他们先前发现的其他历史发现增添了色彩。
据拥有并经营英国铁路基础设施的NetworkRail称，工人们在发现英国萨里的吉尔福德附近时，正在维修山体滑坡。
一位专业的考古承包商建议，该洞穴可能在中世纪被用作圣凯瑟琳教堂的圣地或隐士。
14世纪早期教堂的废墟坐落在铁路附近的小山上。
根据检查发现的专家的说法，该洞穴的黄金本来可能更大，但似乎只有一小部分幸存下来。

(CNN) Workers discovered a 14th century cave and drawings while doing construction on a railroad in Great Britain earlier this week, adding to the other historic finds they previously uncovered.
The workers were repairing a landslip near Guildford in Surrey, England, when they discovered the cave, according to NetworkRail , which owns and runs Britain's railway infrastructure.
A specialist archaeological contractor suggested the cave may have been used in Medieval times as a shrine or hermitage associated with St. Catherine's Chapel.
The ruins of the early 14th century chapel sit on a hill nearby the railroad.
The cave may have been much bigger in its prime, but it seems only a small section survived, according to experts who examined the findings.

纽约（CNN商业）迪士尼+目前在全球拥有5000万付费用户，使其在推出后仅五个月就达到了其最初的用户预测的惊人范围。
该公司去年对投资者表示，它预计到2024年，迪士尼+的全球用户将达到6000万至9000万。
该公司周三宣布，现在，五个月后，该服务几乎就到了。
迪士尼报告说，2月份有近3000万付费用户，此后该服务的全球影响力不断增加。
该公司没有透露迪士尼+是否因冠状病毒爆发而被迫滞留在数以百万计的人中而受到冲击。

New York (CNN Business) Disney+ now has 50 million paid subscribers globally, putting it within striking range of its initial subscriber projections just five months after it launched.
The company told investors last year that it projected Disney+ would have 60 million to 90 million global subscribers by 2024.
Now, after five months, the service is almost there, the company announced on Wednesday.
Disney reported that it had nearly 30 million paid subscribers in February and since then the service's global footprint has grown.
The company did not say if Disney+ received a bump from millions of people being forced to stay at home because of the coronavirus outbreak.

由西澳大利亚州丹麦Karri House的Ian Weir和Kylie Feher设计，其设计优先于土地清理。
黑色星期六大火迫使澳大利亚国家森林大火建筑法规升级。
威尔说：“我们实际上可以在房屋内部获得那种阳台式的空间。”
建筑师伊恩·韦尔（Ian Weir）制作的原型板上的面板可以向下折叠以保护房屋免受火焰侵害。
列夫说，这将需要改变思维方式，从寻求灌木丛中的孤独到建立更紧密的房屋，以使社区更安全，更高效。

Designed by Ian Weir and Kylie Feher, Karri House in Denmark, Western Australia, prioritizes design over land clearing.
The Black Saturday fires forced an upgrade to Australia's national bushfire building regulations.
"We can get those kind of verandah-style spaces actually within the interior of the house," Weir said.
The panels on this prototype by architect Ian Weir are able to fold down to protect the house from flames.
Lev said it would require a change in thinking, from seeking solitude in the bush to building homes closer together to make communities safer and more efficient.

但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

Mjøstårnet的高度达到280英尺，于去年开放后成为世界上最高的木材建筑。
长期倡导和设计木制建筑的建筑师Michael Green表示，“现在有很多东西在融合。”
Or Framework是位于俄勒冈州波特兰的一座雄心勃勃的148英尺高的木塔，在去年因成本担忧而被取消之前，该塔被设定为美国最高的木塔。
考虑到在2018年之前，俄勒冈州成为美国第一个允许使用18层木制建筑的州，而在美国，没有任何地方允许任何超过6层的建筑物，这一决定意义重大。
该组织表示，除了担心森林砍伐外，洒水喷头不能有效防止烈焰扩散到木结构建筑中。

Reaching 280 feet in height, Mjøstårnet became the world's tallest timber building upon opening last year.
According to architect Michael Green, a longstanding advocate for -- and designer of -- wooden buildings, there are "a whole bunch of things converging right now."
Or Framework, an ambitious 148-foot-tall timber tower in Portland, Oregon, that was set to be the USA's tallest wooden tower before was canceled amid cost concerns last year.
The decision is significant given that, before 2018, when Oregon became the first US state to allow 18-story wooden buildings, nowhere in America permitted anything higher than six.
In addition to concerns about deforestation, the group says sprinklers are ineffective at preventing blazes from spreading through wood buildings.
