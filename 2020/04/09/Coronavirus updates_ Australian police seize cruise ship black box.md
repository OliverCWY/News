Brazil has confirmed the first case of the virus among the indigenous Yanomami. The ethnic group living in remote parts of the rainforest are known for already being vulnerable to foreign diseases.

"We have to be triply cautious with (indigenous) communities, especially the ones that have very little contact with the outside world," Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta said.

The patient is a 15-year-old boy and he's being treated in the intensive care unit at a hospital, officials said.

The country has now confirmed at least seven coronavirus cases among the indigenous population, according to local media. Brazil is home to an estimated 800,000 indigenous people from more than 300 ethnic groups. The first virus case was among the Kokama a week ago.

Overall, Brazil has more than 14,000 confirmed cases and almost 700 deaths.
