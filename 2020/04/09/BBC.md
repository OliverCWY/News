总干事特德罗斯·阿德诺姆·格布雷耶苏斯（Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus）周三在讲话中为世卫组织的工作辩护，并呼吁结束Covid-19的政治化。
在周二首次袭击世卫组织之后，特朗普总统在周三的新闻发布会上重申了他的批评，称该组织必须“正确处理其优先事项”。
世卫组织负责人的一名顾问早些时候表示，他们与中国的密切合作对于了解该疾病的早期阶段“绝对必不可少”。
特朗普总统周二曾表示，世卫组织似乎“非常偏向中国”。
据报道，法国总统马克龙（Emmanuel Macron）周三致电特德罗斯博士，也向世界卫生组织表示了支持。

Speaking on Wednesday, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus defended the WHO's work and called for an end to the politicisation of Covid-19.
After first attacking the WHO on Tuesday, President Trump renewed his criticism at his press briefing on Wednesday, saying the organization must "get its priorities right".
An advisor to the WHO chief earlier said that their close work with China had been "absolutely essential" in understanding the disease in its early stages.
On Tuesday, President Trump had said the WHO appeared to be "very biased toward China".
French President Emmanuel Macron also reportedly offered his support to the World Health Organization in a call to Dr Tedros on Wednesday.

VideoPresident唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）攻击世界卫生组织对冠状病毒的反应，指责它“已将威胁降到最低”。
特朗普政府在决定不使用世卫组织运往数十个国家的Covid-19测试以支持开发美国试剂盒后，本身就受到了审查，事实证明这是有缺陷的。

VideoPresident Donald Trump attacks the World Health Organization's response to the coronavirus, accusing it of having "minimised the threat".
The Trump administration is itself under scrutiny after it decided not to use Covid-19 tests shipped to dozens of countries by the WHO in favour of developing a US kit, which turned out to be faulty.

This includes signing it in front of two independent witnesses in person, and having two people signing it in your presence.
That means independent witnesses are needed, which is difficult when someone is confined to bed and visitors should not be calling amid the current restrictions on movement.

桑德斯先生未能赢得南部各州的主要非裔美国选民，这些选民主要是拜登的。
最近几周，由于Covid-19爆发对健康的担忧，桑德斯先生一直通过在线直播主持竞选活动。
现在预计现年77岁的拜登先生将在八月份的民主党代表大会上被加冕为民主党总统候选人。
桑德斯先生的直播结束后不久，拜登发表了推文：“我很了解伯尼。

Mr Sanders, an Independent, had sought the Democratic presidential nomination before, losing out in 2016 to Hillary Clinton.
Mr Sanders failed to win key African-American voters across the southern states, who largely went for Mr Biden.
In recent weeks, Mr Sanders had been hosting campaign events through online live streams due to health concerns from the Covid-19 outbreak.
Mr Biden, 77, is now expected to be crowned the Democratic presidential nominee at the party's convention in August.
Mr Biden tweeted shortly after Mr Sanders' live stream concluded: "I know Bernie well.

迪士尼Plus于2月份最后一次公布观看人数时，其订阅人数已达到2650万。
与Netflix和亚马逊Prime竞争的迪士尼Plus，上个月已在英国和欧洲其他地区推出。
迪士尼发言人凯文·梅耶（Kevin Mayer）说：“我们真的很高兴迪斯尼Plus在全球范围内引起了共鸣。”
但是迪士尼Plus（包括迪士尼，皮克斯，《星球大战》和《国家地理》的电影和电视节目）的发展比其竞争对手快得多。
电影业分析师克里斯·芬顿（Chris Fenton）说：“迪士尼Plus在五个月内所取得的成就使Netflix花了七年的时间。”

When Disney Plus last announced viewing figures in February it had reached 26.5 million subscribers.
Disney Plus, which rivals Netflix and Amazon Prime, rolled out to the UK and other parts of Europe last month.
"We're truly humbled that Disney Plus is resonating with millions around the globe," said Kevin Mayer, a Disney spokesman.
But Disney Plus, which includes films and TV shows from Disney, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic, has grown much faster than its rivals.
"What Disney Plus has achieved in five months took Netflix seven years," said Chris Fenton, a movie industry analyst.

广泛的可能性反映出有关健康危机的不确定性。
更为悲观的情况将导致全球贸易下降，类似于90年前的大萧条，但时间更短。
他说，局势首先是健康危机，他承认各国政府必须采取步骤保护人们的生命。
当然，这需要基于未来几个月在应对健康危机方面取得的实质性进展。
该报告说，全球贸易的增长在去年年底已经停滞。

The wide range of possibilities reflects the uncertainties about the health crisis.
The more pessimistic case would amount to a decline in global trade similar to what happened in the great depression 90 years ago but in shorter period of time.
He said the situation was first and foremost a health crisis and he acknowledged that governments had to take steps to protect people's lives.
That of course would need to be based on substantial progress over the next few months in getting on top of the health crisis.
The report says that the growth in global trade had already stalled towards the end of last year.

同时，Monster表示，在过去两周中，英国寻找“农业”或“农民工”工作的用户数量几乎增加了两倍。

Indeed.co.uk said that there had been a huge spike in interest for fruit picker jobs in particular.
Meanwhile, Monster said the number of UK users searching for "farm" or "farm worker" jobs had nearly tripled in the last two weeks.
Farmers need about 70,000 workers to cover the jobs usually carried out by seasonal migrants, according to the British Growers’ Association.
Another scheme is being put together for fruit pickers by industry bodies British Summer Fruit and British Apples and Pears.

在1945年至1989年之间，波兰各地的城镇和村庄建立了3,000座教堂。
这些教堂既没有法律禁止，也没有被禁止，这些教堂-其中许多看起来像是从外太空到达的，令人大跌眼镜-对于建筑师来说是天赐之物。
“建立一个建筑实践是不可能的，”《天七建筑》（Day-VII Architecture）一书的合著者伊扎贝拉·西乔斯卡（IzabelaCichońska）解释说，这些书对这些教堂进行了分类。
他设计了三座教堂，包括波兰女王格洛夫（Glogów）的圣母玛利亚教堂。
尽管这些教堂中最好的教堂在视觉上大饱眼福，但它们的建筑也许比其设计更为独特。

In towns and villages across Poland, 3,000 churches were built between 1945 and 1989.
Neither legal nor prohibited, these churches – many of them eye-popping edifices that look as if they’ve arrived from outer space – were a godsend for architects.
“It was impossible to set up an architectural practice,” explains Izabela Cichońska, co-author of the book Day-VII Architecture, that catalogues these churches.
He designed three churches including Glogów’s Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Queen of Poland.
Despite the visual feast that the best of these churches represents, their construction is perhaps even more extraordinary than their design.

但是，如果您需要一些额外的动力来进行春季大扫除，则可能其中藏有宝藏。
有价值的金属和矿物质被锁在我们积聚在尘土飞扬的角落的旧产品内。
总的来说，我们的房屋和后院是一个“城市矿山”，里面装满了这些等待挖掘的重要材料。
它们中的每一种都包含铜，银甚至金，以及各种有价值的稀土元素。
因此，将其更多地视为将您的ard积物整理成整齐的堆放，以便以后回收的机会。

If you need a little extra motivation for the spring clean, though, there’s probably treasure hidden in there.
Locked inside the old products we hoard in dusty corners are valuable metals and minerals.
Collectively, our homes and backyards are an “urban mine” filled with these essential materials that are just waiting to be dug out.
Each of these contains copper, silver and even gold, along with a wide range of valuable rare earth elements.
So, view this more as an opportunity to sort your hoard into neat piles, for recycling later.

对于其他人而言，情况无异于：在周围的人处处处感到尴尬，and琐的自我怀疑掩盖了每个决定。
如果您属于后一组，您可能会想知道为什么要成为领导者会让您感到恐惧，以及为什么觉得自己很难成为经理。
如果您的父母使紫罗兰萎缩，那么您也同样会增加几率。
关键是父母对您的举止。

You’ve probably noticed how some of your colleagues take to leadership roles like a duck to water.
It couldn’t be more different for others: bossing around people feels awkward, and a nagging self-doubt shadows every decision.
If you’re in the latter group, you might wonder why the thought of being a leader fills you with dread, and why you find it so hard to even see yourself as a manager.
If your parents were shrinking violets, the odds are increased that you will be too.
And key here is the way your parents behaved toward you.
