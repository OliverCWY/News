Russian social media users have been posting videos and photos of close-packed crowds in metro stations across Moscow during the morning rush hour, as the city’s new digital pass system comes into effect.

The mandatory high tech passes are meeting low tech, physical police checks with officers inspecting each passenger’s passport, and the QR code on their phone, before letting them through the turnstiles.

The long queues have caused a flood of anxious comment online about the risk of spreading coronavirus. That’s just what this new system was supposed to reduce, with tighter controls on who can move about. All essential workers travelling into or around Moscow, including medics and hospital staff, now need to apply in advance for a pass and there’s a steep fine for anyone found without.

After rush hour the crowds subsided and there were no obvious police checks at several stations. Officials say since the lockdown the number of people using the metro each day has dropped by some 80%.

Already stringent, Moscow’s lockdown measures are getting even tougher as the number of Covid-19 patients continues to rise steeply. A record 3,388 new infections were reported on Wednesday, taking the total to 24,490 across Russia. The government has warned that hospitals in Moscow are already "at their limit" and it’s urgently preparing extra beds.
