SINGAPORE - Catch up with the hottest topics on The Straits Times' weekday talk show.

The Big Story, broadcast every weekday at 5.30pm on Facebook and YouTube, has reporters and senior editors discussing the top stories of the day, in the heart of the newsroom.

Helmed by multimedia correspondent Hairianto Diman and assistant video editor Olivia Quay, the show airs live from ST's digital studio.

On Wednesday's episode (April 15), we will speak to Hong Kong correspondent Claire Huang about the city's strategy to contain the Covid-19 spread as it sees a declining number of new cases.

We will then have the senior partner and head of dispute resolution practice at law firm Tito Isaac & Co, Mr Justin Chan, to explain what is allowed and not allowed under the new Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act.

Deputy tech editor Trevor Tan rounds up the episode with a discussion on how effective UV sanitisers are for cleaning gadgets, and how to unlock the iPhone Face ID when wearing a mask.

Topics covered in previous episodes include the rising number of unlinked Covid-19 cases in Singapore and the state of wet markets in China, which have recently come under increased scrutiny amid the coronavirus outbreak.
