与军事支持的项目是腺病毒载体疫苗不同，这两种新候选药物是灭活疫苗，其免疫力比活疫苗弱。
这是全球首批开始试验的两种灭活疫苗。
中国以前还开发了其他用于H1N1流感，甲型肝炎，手足口病和小儿麻痹症的灭活疫苗。
据说至少有八家中国机构和公司参与了Covid-19疫苗的研发。

Unlike the military-backed project, which is an adenovirus vector vaccine, the two new candidates are inactivated vaccines which provide weaker immunity than live vaccines.
These are the first two inactivated vaccines to start trial globally.
China has previously developed other inactivated vaccines for H1N1, hepatitis A, hand-foot-mouth disease and polio.
At least eight Chinese institutes and companies are said to be involved in the research and development of a vaccine for Covid-19.

华盛顿（彭博社）–中国批评美国总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）暂时停止向世界卫生组织（WHO）提供资金的举措，并承诺支持全球卫生组织。
特朗普在白宫新闻发布会上说：“世卫组织没有履行其基本职责，必须追究责任。”
在世界卫生危机期间停止为世界卫生组织提供资金，听起来确实很危险。
联合国秘书长是在特朗普宣布宣布之前与他取得联系的一个人。
“世界卫生组织领导并协调与流行病的斗争。

WASHINGTON (BLOOMBERG) – China has criticised United States President Donald Trump’s move to temporarily halt funding to the World Health Organisation, and pledged to support the global health body.
“The WHO failed in its basic duty and must be held accountable,” Mr Trump said at a White House press conference.
Halting funding for the World Health Organization during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds.
One person who reached out to Mr Trump ahead of his announcement was the UN secretary-general.
“The World Health Organisation leads and coordinates the fight against pandemics.

巴黎（彭博社）-羟氯喹是美国总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）赞扬的65岁疟疾药物，是一种冠状病毒的治疗选择，它在一项小型研究中似乎没有帮助患者摆脱病原体。
根据中国16个中心的150名住院患者对医生的研究，该药不能比常规治疗更好地清除病毒，而且更可能引起副作用。
服用羟氯喹的75人组中有更多的副作用，但大多数是轻度的，最常见的是腹泻。
由上海瑞金医院的唐伟博士领导的研究人员写道，该药的抗炎作用可能有助于缓解患者的症状。
最近几周，这种药物成为头条新闻，并得到了特朗普先生的认可，目前正在对羟氯喹进行更多的研究。

PARIS (BLOOMBERG) - Hydroxychloroquine, the 65-year-old malaria drug that United States President Donald Trump has praised as a treatment option for coronavirus, appeared not to help patients get rid of the pathogen in a small study.
The pill did not help patients clear the virus better than standard care and was much more likely to cause side effects, according to a study of 150 hospitalised patients by doctors at 16 centres in China.
There were more side effects in the group of 75 people who took hydroxychloroquine, but they were mostly mild, the most common being diarrhoea.
The researchers, led by Dr Wei Tang of Ruijin Hospital in Shanghai, wrote that the medicine's anti-inflammatory effects probably helped alleviate patients' symptoms.
More studies of hydroxychloroquine are under way after the medicine made headlines in recent weeks and was endorsed by Mr Trump.

新加坡-从即日起，每个人出门时必须戴口罩，这是更严格的措施的一部分，以遏制冠状病毒的进一步扩散，这是强制性的。
他说，包括外劳在内的新加坡劳动力中约有20％继续通勤，因为他们必须提供基本服务。
黄先生表示，要求在公共场合戴口罩的要求可能会延长到5月4日结束的断路器期限之后。
国防部表示，无论是前线工作人员还是执行后台职能，所有基本工人都必须戴口罩。
国防部表示：“我们必须计算这个断路器的使用期限，并在存在风险的地方加紧。”

SINGAPORE - It is mandatory, with immediate effect, for everyone to wear a mask when they step out as part of stricter measures to curb the further spread of the coronavirus.
About 20 per cent of Singapore's workforce, including foreign workers, continue to commute to work as they are in essential services, he said.
Mr Wong said the requirement to wear masks in public may extend even beyond the circuit breaker period, which ends on May 4.
All essential workers must also don masks, whether they are frontline staff or performing back office functions, the ministry said.
“We must make this circuit breaker period count, and tighten where there are areas of risk,” the ministry said.

惠灵顿（路透社）-鉴于冠状病毒大流行的经济影响，新西兰总理雅辛达·阿登（Jacinda Ardern）及其政府和公共服务首席执行官的部长们将在未来六个月内将工资削减20％。
她补充说：“我们感谢新西兰人依靠工资补贴，减薪并由于全球大流行而失业。”
新西兰周三记录了20例新的冠状病毒引起的Covid-19病例，该病例总数达到1,386例。
“这将包括为成本压力提供资金，这是使我们的国家继续努力的必要部分。
但是，我们将投入大量资源来开始这种复苏，”罗伯逊先生在致企业领导人的演讲中说。

WELLINGTON (REUTERS) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, ministers in her government and public service chief executives will take a 20 per cent pay cut for the next six months, given the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
"We acknowledge New Zealanders who are reliant on wage subsides, taking a pay cut and losing their jobs as a result of the global pandemic," she added.
New Zealand on Wednesday recorded 20 new cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases to 1,386.
"It will include funding for the cost pressures that are a necessary part of keeping our country ticking over.
But we will devote much of our resources to kickstarting this recovery," Mr Robertson said in his speech streamed to business leaders.

周三（4月15日），有超过1500万人居住在毗邻国家首都的城市勿加泗，茂物和德波。
严格的措施包括禁止五人以上的公共聚会，宗教和社会活动以及强制使用口罩。
官方数据显示，按照更严格的社会隔离规则，总人数将达到3400万人。
去年的开斋节期间，估计有1,950万人从雅加达等大城市前往家乡。
印度尼西亚爆发该病毒后，估计有280万人失业。

More than 15 million people living in Bekasi, Bogor and Depok - cities adjoining the national capital - were brought under large scale social distancing rules on Wednesday (April 15).
The stringent measures include a ban on public gatherings of more than five people, religious and social events and mandatory use of masks.
That would take the total number of people under tighter social distancing rules to 34 million, official data show.
An estimated 19.5 million people travelled to their hometowns from big cities like Jakarta during last year's Eid.
An estimated 2.8 million people have become jobless after the outbreak of the virus in Indonesia.

但是，重症监护病房的人数在24小时内从6,821人下降到6,730人-连续第六天下降，这表明3月17日实施的全国禁闭在控制这种疾病方面取得了一些成功。
他补充说，确诊感染总数上升了5.3％，达到103,573例，而周一的增长率为2.8％，周日的增长率为1.7％。
疗养院中还有26,680例可疑冠状病毒病例，使总数超过130,000例确诊和可能病例，在世界范围内排名第五。
根据各种运行模拟，所罗门说，根据不同地区的计算，法国人口中有5％至10％可能患有该病。

PARIS (REUTERS) - France said its total death toll from Covid-19 infections rose above 15,000 on Tuesday (April 14), becoming the fourth country to exceed that threshold after Italy, Spain and the United States, while the rate of increase in cases and fatalities is re-accelerating.
But the number of people in intensive care units fell to 6,730 from 6,821 over 24 hours - declining for a sixth consecutive day, suggesting the national lockdown put in place on March 17 is having some success in containing the disease.
He added that the total number of confirmed infections had climbed by 5.3 per cent to 103,573, compared to a rate of increase of 2.8 per cent on Monday and of 1.7 per cent on Sunday.
There were also 26,680 suspected coronavirus cases in nursing homes, taking the total to more than 130,000 confirmed and possible cases, the fifth highest in the world.
According to various running simulations, Salomon said that, depending on calculations for different regions, 5 per cent to 10 per cent of the French population had probably contracted the disease.

伦敦（纽约时报）-随着英国结案报告的100,000例冠状病毒病例-这是严重蔓延其政治领导地位的一次蔓延的重要里程碑-大量新统计数据表明，政府正在低估这种病毒的人力和经济成本流行性。
与美国和其他国家一样，英国的疗养院已成为该病毒的热点地区。
据估计，该病毒死亡的90.2％发生在医院，而其余的死亡发生在疗养院，收容所或家中。
它报告说有3,475例死亡与冠状病毒有关。
这表明要么人们死于其他疾病的比率大大高于正常水平，要么表明冠状病毒杀死的人数甚至超过了所估计的人数。

LONDON (NYTIMES) - As Britain closes in on 100,000 reported cases of the coronavirus - a solemn milestone in a contagion that has ravaged its political leadership - a raft of new statistics suggests that the government is undercounting the human, and economic, cost of the epidemic.
As in the United States and other countries, nursing homes in Britain have become hot zones for the virus.
It estimated that 90.2 per cent of deaths from the virus occurred in hospitals, while the rest occurred in nursing homes, hospices, or at home.
It reported that 3,475 deaths were registered as involving coronavirus.
This suggests either that people are dying of other illnesses at significantly greater than normal rates or that coronavirus is killing even more people than is being accounted for.
