您的设备上不支持媒体播放媒体标题特朗普说，世卫组织“未能履行其基本职责”美国总统唐纳德·特朗普说，他将停止向世界卫生组织（WHO）提供资金，因为该组织“已履行了其基本职责”应对冠状病毒爆发。
特朗普在星期二在白宫举行的新闻发布会上说：“我正在指示我的政府停止拨款，同时进行了评估，以评估世界卫生组织在严重管理不善和掩盖冠状病毒传播方面的作用。”
特朗普表示，审查将持续60至90天，届时将决定美国是否恢复供资。
微软的创始人兼慈善家比尔·盖茨在推特上说：“在世界卫生危机期间，暂停为世界卫生组织提供资金是危险的。”
特朗普先生指责世卫组织首次在武汉市爆发时没有适当评估疫情。

"I am directing my administration to halt funding while a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization's role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus," Mr Trump told a news conference at the White House on Tuesday.
A decision on whether the US resumes funding will be made after the review, which Mr Trump said would last 60 to 90 days.
Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder and philanthropist, said on Twitter: "Halting funding for the World Health Organization during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds."
Mr Trump accused the WHO of having failed to adequately assess the outbreak when it first emerged in the city of Wuhan.

总理梅特·弗雷德里克森（Mette Frederiksen）欢迎孩子们在首都哥本哈根重返校园。
丹麦是欧洲最早实行封锁的国家之一，学校于3月12日关闭。
丹麦迄今报告了299例死亡和6,681例阳性病例，尽管据认为还有更多的人被感染。
一些政治人物表示担心，不清楚谁应该上学的指导方针。
德国人口最多的州北莱茵-威斯特法伦州（North Rhine-Westphalia）旨在从下周初开始逐步从小学开始重新开放学校。

Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen welcomed children as they went back to school in the capital Copenhagen.
Denmark was among the first countries in Europe to impose a lockdown, with schools closed on 12 March.
Denmark has so far reported 299 deaths and 6,681 positive cases, although many more are thought to be infected.
Some political figures have expressed concerns that guidelines setting out who should go back to school are unclear.
North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, aims to reopen schools gradually starting with primary schools from the start of next week.

尽管祖母给她未来的丈夫写的信不见了，但她一直保留着祖父的信，直到她在2005年去世。
自从我第一次阅读祖父的来信以来已经过去了五年，我再次回到家中。
然而，他的战时书信充满了年轻的理想主义和对未来病痛的希望：“我是如此爱你，以至于我真的束手无策。
如果有一天，如果我所有的梦想都实现了，我想请你做我的妻子。”写战时信并不只针对第二次世界大战。
只要写信，您就花时间退后一步，以为祖父的战时信件启发了我写我自己的信件。

Although the letters my grandmother wrote to her future husband were lost to time, she kept my grandfather’s letters in her possession until her death in 2005.
Five years have passed since I first read my grandfather’s letters, and I am once again housebound.
Yet his wartime letters overflowed with youthful idealism and love-sick hopes for the future:“I love you so much that I’m really tied up.
Some day if all my dreams come true I’ll want to ask you to be my wife.”Writing wartime letters wasn’t particular to World War Two.
Mail call whenever it happened it was a delight.”By writing letters, you take the time to step back and thinkMy grandfather’s wartime letters have inspired me to write letters of my own.

这正是该新系统应减少的功能，同时严格控制了可以移动的人员。
官员们说，自封锁以来，每天使用地铁的人数下降了约80％。
随着Covid-19患者的人数继续急剧上升，莫斯科已经采取了更加严格的封锁措施。
政府警告说，莫斯科的医院已经“处于极限”，并且正在紧急准备加床。

The long queues have caused a flood of anxious comment online about the risk of spreading coronavirus.
That’s just what this new system was supposed to reduce, with tighter controls on who can move about.
Officials say since the lockdown the number of people using the metro each day has dropped by some 80%.
Already stringent, Moscow’s lockdown measures are getting even tougher as the number of Covid-19 patients continues to rise steeply.
The government has warned that hospitals in Moscow are already "at their limit" and it’s urgently preparing extra beds.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak has also previously ruled out the taxpayer giving 100% backing for the loan scheme.

HM Treasury said: "The loan scheme is designed to give banks and businesses confidence, and ensure that viable businesses get the support they need.

对于大多数说土著语言和方言的人来说，这是现实。
尽管Facebook支持多达111种语言，使其成为最多语言的在线平台，但联合国教科文组织在2008年发布的一项调查发现，互联网上98％的网页仅以12种语言发布，其中一半以上是英语。
这将在线语言的多样性减少到了少数几种方言，这使得说互联网上被排除的语言之一的人们更加困难。
MiguelÁngelOxlaj Kumez也是其中的一员，并且是2019年举行的首届拉丁美洲互联网土著语言节的组织者之一。
他说：“当我上网时，发现超过90％的内容都是英语，因此很大一部分是西班牙语和其他语言。”

This is the reality for most people that speak indigenous languages and dialects.
While Facebook supports up to 111 languages, making it the most multilingual online platform, a survey published by Unesco in 2008 found that 98% of the internet’s web pages are published in just 12 languages, and more than half of them are in English.
This reduces linguistic diversity online to a handful of tongues, making it harder for those that speak one of the excluded languages of the internet.
Miguel Ángel Oxlaj Kumez is part of it and was one of the organisers of the first Latin American Festival of Indigenous Languages on the Internet, held in 2019.
“When I get on the internet I find more than 90% of the content in English and hence a significant percentage in Spanish and other languages,” he says.

但是广岛地区享有盛名，它的人均拥有比全国其他地区更多的御好烧餐厅；仅广岛市就有2000多个。
位于广岛市区中心的Okonomimura（实际上是Okonomi村）是一个四层的迷宫，有25多家okonomiyaki餐厅，每家餐厅都有自己的特色。
这实际上是广岛人民的灵魂食品广岛的御好烧的早期原型最早出现在第二次世界大战前时期。
Otafuku的公共关系官Shizuka Kobara说，“广岛与okonomiyaki并驾齐驱；广岛与okonomiyaki并驾齐驱。从那时起，它扎根于公民，成为他们最喜欢的食物。
“这真是广岛人的灵魂食品。”如果您去过广岛，即使您没有尝试过，也会闻到御好烧的味道。

But the Hiroshima region holds a distinctive claim to fame: it has more okonomiyaki restaurants per capita than any other region in the country; and there are more than 2,000 of them in Hiroshima city alone.
Okonomimura (literally Okonomi Village), in the heart of downtown Hiroshima, is a four-floor labyrinth of more than 25 okonomiyaki restaurants, each with its own variations.
It’s literally soul food for Hiroshima peopleAn early prototype of Hiroshima’s okonomiyaki first appeared in the pre-World War Two period.
According to Shizuka Kobara, public relations officer at Otafuku, the leading Hiroshima-based manufacturer of that sweet-smelling okonomiyaki sauce, “Hiroshima developed side-by-side with okonomiyaki; it took root in the citizens and became their favourite food since then.
It’s literally soul food for Hiroshima people.”If you’ve ever been to Hiroshima, you’ll have smelled okonomiyaki, even if you didn’t try it.

名为“一切”的游戏已有一段时间了。
但是，对于像我这样的人来说，这可以摆脱工作压力和妄想症的困扰，变成一种精致的无聊形式。
根据娱乐零售商协会（ERA）的数据，英国的游戏产业比2019年音乐和电影业的总和更有价值。
当锁定在3月开始时，游戏平台Steam报告了有史以来最高的同时登录用户数。
诸如刺客信条之类的代码指导性大片游戏虽然很成功，但在游戏方面有些困扰。

The game called Everything has been out for a while now.
For someone like me, though, it was an escape from the turbulence of work pressure and paranoia into an exquisite form of boredom.
According to the Entertainment Retailers Association (ERA), the games industry in the UK was more valuable than the music and film industry combined in 2019.
When the lockdown started in March, the gaming platform Steam reported its highest ever number of concurrent users logged on at once.
Code directed blockbuster games like Assassin’s Creed, and was successful, but something bugged her about gaming.

不管这些错误直觉的原因是什么，随后的研究表明，赌徒的谬误可能会给赌场带来严重后果。
“然而，这还不是我们在数据中所能看到的。”赌徒的谬误在那些特别需要公正，公正的判断的职业中是一个特殊的问题。
一个研究小组最近分析了美国法官关于是否向难民提供庇护的决定。
作为最终测试，该团队分析了美国职棒大联盟比赛中裁判的决定。
她说：“因为这些人都是专业人士，因此他们将决策作为其主要职业的一部分。”

Whatever the reason for these false intuitions, subsequent research has revealed that gambler’s fallacy can have serious consequences far beyond the casino.
“Yet that is not what we can see in the data.”The gambler’s fallacy is a particular problem in the very professions that specifically require an even, unbiased judgement.
One team of researchers recently analysed US judges’ decisions on whether or not to grant asylum to refugees.
As a final test, the team analysed umpires’ decisions in Major League Baseball games.
“Because these are professionals and they're making decisions as part of their primary occupation,” she says.

结束语我们的眼睛怎么说？
随着生物的进化，这个斑块开始向内弯曲以更好地聚焦光线。
当涉及到我们的学生时，不仅仅是变化的大小而已-动物的学生的形状可以告诉我们它是捕食者还是猎物。
我们的圆形学生是两全其美的，可以帮助我们积极觅食和追捕猎物。
大而灵敏的眼睛使最大的可用光线能够通过。

Close TranscriptWhat do our eyes say about us?
As the creatures evolved, this patch started to curve inward to better focus light.
When it comes to our pupils, it's not just the size of them that varies - the shape of an animal's pupils can tell us if it's predator or prey.
Our round pupils are kind of a best of both worlds and help us in active foraging and chasing down prey.
Their large, sensitive eyes allow the maximum available light to pass through.

鸡蛋可以使面包结构和提起力，而一点点额外的膨松剂和活化酸也可以解决这个问题。
在小烤盘中，例如我们的纯素松饼和纯素巧克力蛋糕，这种交换是不明显的。
同样，在无蛋蓬松煎饼混合物中，它的工作就像是一场梦（好吧，严格来说不是烘烤！）。
您可以将此解决方案扩展到一个大型的生日蛋糕，例如我们的无蛋巧克力蛋糕和下图所示的甜美的素食主义者巧克力花生酱蛋糕。
注意–烘烤可能会有点干，过多的起毛剂会产生金属味。

Eggs give bakes structure and lift, and a little extra raising agent plus an activating acid can handle this too.
The swap is unnoticeable in small bakes, such as our vegan muffins and vegan chocolate cupcakes.
Likewise, it works like a dream in eggless fluffy pancake mix (okay, not strictly a bake\!).
You can stretch this solution to a big birthday-style cake, such as our eggless chocolate cake and the luscious vegan chocolate peanut butter cake pictured below.
Caution – bakes can be a little dry, and too much raising agent will give a metallic taste.
