（CNN）两名正在通话的医生说，上周的一个电话中，美国一些顶级科学家向白宫官员介绍了抗体测试。
白宫冠状病毒特别工作组的协调员黛博拉·伯克斯（Deborah Birx）博士称此类测试“至关重要”。
首先，美国食品药品监督管理局放宽了其规则，现在公司可以出售抗体测试，而无需提交表明其实际工作的验证数据。
接到电话的几天后，NAS科学家写信给白宫，坦率地告知他们有关抗体测试的质量。
芬伯格说，他感到白宫官员在电话会议上密切关注。

(CNN) In a phone call last week, some of the nation's top scientists briefed White House officials about antibody testing, according to two doctors who were on the call.
Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, has called such tests "critical."
First, the US Food and Drug Administration relaxed its rules, and now companies can sell antibody tests without submitting validation data that shows they actually work.
A few days after the phone call, the NAS scientists wrote a letter to the White House frankly apprising them about the quality of antibody tests.
Fineberg said he felt that the White House officials paid close attention on the call.

研究人员在周二预测，美国可能不得不忍受社会疏远措施，例如留在家中的订单和学校停课，直到2022年。
也就是说，除非能迅速获得疫苗。
陈公共卫生学院，于星期二在《科学》杂志上发表了他们的发现。
哈佛大学公共卫生学院的研究小组使用了有关Covid-19和其他冠状病毒的已知知识，为当前大流行创造了可能的情景。
他们在报告中写道：“到2022年，可能需要间歇性间隔，除非重症监护能力显着提高或可获得治疗或疫苗。”

The US may have to endure social distancing measures -- such as stay-at-home orders and school closures -- until 2022, researchers projected on Tuesday.
That is, unless, a vaccine becomes quickly available.
Chan School of Public Health, who published their findings in the journal Science on Tuesday .
The team at the Harvard School of Public Health used what's known about Covid-19 and other coronaviruses to create possible scenarios of the current pandemic.
"Intermittent distancing may be required into 2022 unless critical care capacity is increased substantially or a treatment or vaccine becomes available," they wrote in their report.

他也不是第一个尝试道歉的人，只是让更多民族主义的中国网民为寻求新的头皮而疏忽了更多涉嫌犯罪的行为。
多年来，中国互联网民族主义者超越了防火墙，追随该国批评家对Facebook和Twitter等被禁止的社交媒体网站的批评。
香港和台湾的海报很快就加入进来，前香港立法委员内森·罗（Nathan Law）写道：“看着亲CCP（中国共产党）的在线军队试图攻击布莱特，真是太有趣了。
过去，与香港一样，北京所培养的民族主义情绪也造成了某种反馈回路。
这导致中国大陆许多在线呼吁中国军队进行干预。

Nor was he the first to try to apologize, only to have more alleged transgressions dredged up by nationalist Chinese web users looking for a new scalp.
For years, Chinese internet nationalists have leapfrogged the Great Firewall to go after the country's critics on banned social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.
Hong Kong and Taiwanese posters soon joined in, with former Hong Kong lawmaker Nathan Law writing , "so funny watching the pro-CCP (Chinese Communist Party) online army trying to attack Bright.
With Hong Kong too, nationalist sentiment fostered by Beijing has in the past created something of a feedback loop.
This led to calls from many online in mainland China for the Chinese military to intervene.

但是，与出售诸如谷物或家用产品等不易腐烂商品的干货市场相反，干货市场只是提供大量新鲜农产品的地方。
但是，大多数湿市场不是装满准备被宰杀的外来动物的病毒培养皿。
据中国官方媒体新华社报道，截至3月22日，至少有94％的中国大陆湿货市场已经重新开放。
相反，新的政策和法规需要结合科学证据，同时考虑到不同的文化观念和对野生动植物，野生动植物贸易和消费的价值观。”
但是近年来，像全球其他地方一样，超市市场，尤其是年轻消费者中，潮湿的市场已经失去了市场。

But wet markets, as opposed to dry markets, which sell non-perishable goods such as grain or household products, are simply places that offer a wide range of fresh produce.
Most wet markets, however, are not virus petri-dishes filled with exotic animals ready to be slaughtered.
According to Chinese state-run media Xinhua, at least 94% of mainland China's wet markets had been reopened as of March 22.
Instead, new policies and regulations need to incorporate scientific evidence together with consideration of different cultural perceptions and values towards wildlife, wildlife trade and consumption."
But in recent years, like everywhere else globally, wet markets have lost ground to supermarkets, especially among younger consumers.

1998年至2000年，他曾在克林顿总统的政府中担任白宫新闻秘书。
这是在我们现任总统的真人秀表演式管理中经常丢失的真实事物。
正如人们所料，巴拉克·奥巴马（Barack Obama）周二对乔·拜登（Joe Biden）的支持对民主党赢得白宫的机会仍然至关重要。
前总统奥巴马的点头巩固了拜登在赢得选举所需的民主党选区中的现有优势，尤其是黑人。
更重要的是，奥巴马在竞选过程中的帮助将激发年轻人的积极性，其中许多人最近才对两位总统的生活记忆犹新。

He was the White House press secretary from 1998-2000 in President Bill Clinton's administration.
This is a true thing that has often been lost amid the reality show-style administration of our current President.
While it was expected, Barack Obama's endorsement Tuesday of Joe Biden is still critically important to the Democrat's chances of winning back the White House.
Former President Obama's nod reinforces Biden's existing strengths among the Democratic constituencies he needs to win the election, particularly black Americans.
More importantly, Obama's help on the campaign trail will motivate young people, many of whom have only recent memories of two presidents in their lives.

倾倒牛奶的听起来很像：在将牛奶运送到加工者并变成乳制品之前将其处置。
甚至在大流行爆发之前，奶农和牛奶加工商都在挣扎。
美国奶农协会理事会主席丹尼斯·罗登鲍说，倾倒牛奶是奶牛场的最后选择。
像奶农自己一样，牛奶加工者在大流行之前也很挣扎。
他们还要求美国农业部（USDA）为奶农补偿废弃牛奶约三个月。

Dumping milk is pretty much what it sounds like: Disposing of milk before it is delivered to processors and turned into dairy products.
Both dairy farmers and milk processors were struggling even before the pandemic hit.
Milk dumping is the last resort for dairy farms, said Dennis Rodenbaugh, president of council operations for Dairy Farmers of America.
Like the dairy farmers themselves, milk processors were also struggling prior to the pandemic.
They've also asked the USDA to compensate dairy farmers for the discarded milk for about three months.

冠状病毒大流行间接唤起了公众重新呼吁改变台湾最大承运人中华航空的名称的呼吁。
最近几天，岛上的网民表示担心，由于其名称，人们会将航空公司的图像与中国大陆而非台湾联系在一起。
而现在，中华航空的官员似乎并不反对做出改变的想法。
总理说：“改变中华航空的名字的问题并不那么简单。”
2018年，北京要求全球航空公司改变在其网站上提及台湾的方式或采取制裁措施。

The coronavirus pandemic has indirectly reignited fresh calls from the public to change the name of Taiwan's largest carrier, China Airlines.
In recent days, netizens on the island have expressed worries that people would associate images of the airline with mainland China, not Taiwan, due to its name.
And now, it appears officials at China Airlines aren't opposed to the idea of making the change.
"The issue of changing China Airlines' name is not that simple," said the premier.
In 2018, Beijing demanded global airlines change how they refer to Taiwan on their websites or risk sanctions.

纽约（CNN商业版）随着冠状病毒在非裔美国人社区中流传，零售商店和杂货店的黑人工人越来越容易受到伤害。
洛杉矶艾伯森一家的收银员，联合食品和商业工人联合会成员帕姆·希尔说：“我是最主要的客户中心。”
当病毒开始传播时，希尔商店的一些顾客和工人并没有认真对待它，这是因为有一个神话，即黑人无法获得冠状病毒。
在她店里的两名工人检测到冠状病毒呈阳性后，这种情况迅速改变。
零售店和杂货店是少数几个仍在开放的公共场所，其中黑人工人的比例过高。

New York (CNN Business) As the coronavirus tears through African American communities, black workers at retail and grocery stores feel increasingly vulnerable.
"I'm up front and center with a lot of customers," said Pam Hill, a cashier at Albertsons in Los Angeles and a member of the United Food and Commercial Workers union.
When the virus first started spreading, some customers and workers at Hill's store didn't take it seriously because of a debunked myth that black people couldn't get coronavirus.
That quickly changed after two workers at her store tested positive for coronavirus.
Retail and grocery stores are some of the few public spaces still open, and they are disproportionately staffed by black workers.

伊朗国际象棋仲裁员在一月份比赛结束后仍未返回家中，她担心在网上因不戴合适的头巾而受到惩罚后受到惩罚。
巴亚特的担忧来自事件中拍摄的一张照片，该照片似乎表明她没有戴头巾。
巴亚特对美国有线电视新闻网（CNN Sport）说：“我知道我必须遮住头发，所以我像许多伊朗妇女一样这样做，但是我穿着宽松的头巾，因为我不相信头巾。”
在试图专注于手头的工作时，巴亚特随后向伊朗国际象棋联合会寻求保证，伊朗国际象棋联合会已经使她警惕了在家中酝酿的明显风暴。
美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）多次与伊朗国际象棋联合会联系，但未收到任何回应。

The Iranian chess arbiter is yet to return home to her family following the conclusion of the tournament in January, fearing punishment after she was criticized online for not wearing the appropriate headscarf.
Bayat's concerns stem from a photograph taken from the event which appears to show her not wearing a hijab.
"I knew that I had to cover my hair so I did that like many Iranian women but I was wearing a loose hijab because I don't believe in the hijab," Bayat told CNN Sport.
While trying to focus on the job at hand, Bayat was subsequently seeking reassurances from the Iranian Chess Federation who had alerted her to the apparent storm brewing at home.
CNN reached out to the Iranian Chess Federation on multiple occasions but has not received a response.

这名男子对他公司的雇员感到惊讶，他们为他组织了一次达索（Dassault）Rafale B喷气式飞机的欢庆活动。
调查人员发现，这位不愿透露姓名的人从未表达过乘坐战斗机飞行的愿望，也没有以前的军事航空经验。
但是该名男子随行，参加了一次三架飞机的训练演习。
Rafale B被法国空军使用，最高时速接近每小时1400公里（每小时870英里）。
不幸的是，那是弹出器座椅按钮，而这名64岁的飞行员从战斗机上飞了出来。

The man had been surprised by employees at his firm, who had organized a joyride in a Dassault Rafale B jet for him as a treat.
The unnamed man had never expressed any desire to fly in a fighter jet and had no previous military aviation experience, investigators discovered.
But the man went through with the ride, joining a three-plane training exercise as a passenger.
The Rafale B is used by the French air force, and has a maximum speed of nearly 1,400 kilometers per hour (870 miles per hour).
Unfortunately, that something was the ejector seat button -- and the 64-year-old flew from the fighter jet.

人们会敞开窗帘来炫耀一个房间，里面装满了最好的家具，装饰品和艺术品，以此向商人证明他们是值得信赖的。
我不确定为什么我不喜欢窗帘。
距离很远，我从未见过有人用双筒望远镜潜入我的房子，所以我不在乎。
我认为许多荷兰人不使用窗帘，因为我们喜欢灯光，而且没有什么可隐藏的。
这种观点是我住在这里的原因中非常重要的一部分。

People would leave curtains open to show off a room full of the finest of furniture, decorations and art as a way of proving to merchants that they were trustworthy.
Why I don't like curtains, I'm not sure.
It's quite a distance and I've never seen anyone with binoculars lurking outside my house, so I don't care.
I think a lot of Dutch people don't use curtains because we like the light and we don't have anything to hide.
The view is a very pivotal part of the reason I'm living here.

东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
后来空袭被认为是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

但是，美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）采访了包括帕特里夏（Patricia）在内的五名十几岁和二十多岁的女性，他们声称格拉瑟（Glaser）在Bery's Place对其进行了性和情感虐待。
当女孩们反对时，他们说格拉泽会威胁要把他们赶出去。
一些幸存者说，格拉瑟（Glaser）介绍自己是一名医生，但支持起诉的律师告诉美国有线电视新闻网（CNN），他是物理治疗师-不是合格的医生。
Dilen于去年2月在Bery's Place进行的一次警察突袭中因警察的讯问而被捕，后来被释放。
但至少现在，他们说他们开始在贝里故居之外享受生活。

But five women in their late teens and early twenties interviewed by CNN, including Patricia, allege that Glaser sexually and emotionally abused them at Bery's Place.
When the girls objected, they say Glaser would threaten to cast them out on the streets.
Some survivors say Glaser introduced himself as a doctor, but lawyers supporting the prosecution told CNN that he is a physiotherapist -- not a qualified physician.
Dilen was arrested for questioning by police last February during a police raid at Bery's Place, and later released.
But for now, at least, they say they're beginning to enjoy their lives outside of Bery's Place.

假日营地变成了隔离营地-隔离饮食-温度检查和穿PPE的工作人员在隔离区生活-感觉就像在学校，营地和监狱中一样奇怪。
我的工厂位于鲤鱼门公园，通常是香港岛东部一个绿树成荫的度假村。
这个假日公园是香港用作冠状病毒检疫中心的几处设施之一。
在此之前，我已经在家工作了三个月-因此，在隔离营中做同样的事情并没有多大区别。
但这证明了香港政府对遏制从海外进口的案件并推回本地自满情绪的重视程度。

Holiday camp turned quarantine campLife in quarantine -- with its regimented meals, temperature checks and PPE-wearing staff -- feels like an odd mix of being in school, at camp, and in prison.
My facility, in Lei Yue Mun Park, is normally a leafy holiday village in the east of Hong Kong Island.
This holiday park is one of several facilities being used as coronavirus quarantine centers in Hong KongSince March, that number has surged.
Prior to now, I'd already been working from home for three months -- so doing the same from a quarantine camp hasn't made much of a difference.
But it's a testament to how serious the Hong Kong government is about clamping down on cases imported from overseas, and pushing back on local complacency.
