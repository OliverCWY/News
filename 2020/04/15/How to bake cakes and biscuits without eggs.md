This is our favourite swap for fluffy cakes. Eggs give bakes structure and lift, and a little extra raising agent plus an activating acid can handle this too. The swap is unnoticeable in small bakes, such as our vegan muffins and vegan chocolate cupcakes. Likewise, it works like a dream in eggless fluffy pancake mix (okay, not strictly a bake\!). You can stretch this solution to a big birthday-style cake, such as our eggless chocolate cake and the luscious vegan chocolate peanut butter cake pictured below.

Caution – bakes can be a little dry, and too much raising agent will give a metallic taste. Always sift in bicarbonate of soda so small lumps are evenly distributed. Our eggless lemon drizzle cake gets around any dryness with its post-bake drizzle. Other solutions are to add more milk or yoghurt to the recipe, frost generously, or heap on plenty of whipped cream and fresh fruit.

We don’t recommend a formula for this egg replacement because there are too many variables and the results could be unpleasant. It’s best to use a tested recipe.
