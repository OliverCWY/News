A second migrant camp in mainland Greece, the old Malakasa facility north of Athens, has been quarantined for 14 days after a 53-year-old man tested positive for coronavirus.

The first case in a migrant camp on the mainland was confirmed on Tuesday.

Another six people also tested positive on the island of Lesbos, home to Moria camp, where 18,000 people are staying in a facility that was built for 3,000.

Earlier this week, the BBC's population correspondent Stephanie Hegarty reported on how people in Moria are trying to protect themselves from the virus in an environment with almost no prospect of social distancing.
