Rice, pasta, noodles and wraps are top of my store-cupboard staples. But recently, like lots of people, I’ve not been able to find them in the supermarket. Trying to suppress a rising panic (okay, there was a brief wobble), I sought out alternatives to keep my meals cheap, quick to make and filling.

Of course, everyone has their own shopping challenges. What I can buy in my local shop might be different from what you can find in yours. Even if you visited exactly the same store as I do, you might find different items on any given day. But I’ve tried lots of alternatives to my favourite carbs, so hopefully there are some ingredients here you’ve been able to find too.
