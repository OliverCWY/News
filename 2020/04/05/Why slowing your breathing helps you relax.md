Just as importantly, the pressure-sensitive baroreceptors, in the arteries around the heart, feed into the vagus nerve. This is an essential element of the nervous system that is thought to be particularly important in dampening the fight-or-flight response after a threat has disappeared. “It allows the body to focus on things that are basically restorative or nourishing,” says Noble – a state that is often known as “rest-and-digest”. By repeatedly stimulating the vagus nerve during those long exhalations, slow breathing may shift the nervous system towards that more restful state, resulting in positive changes like a lower heart rate and lower blood pressure. (To find out more about the vagus nerve and its role in conditions like arthritis, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, read Gaia Vince’s in-depth article at Mosaic, or listen to her radio documentary.)

Interestingly, people practicing breathwork seem to find a sweet spot at around six breaths a minute. This appears to bring about markedly greater relaxation through some kind of a positive feedback loop between the lungs, the heart and the brain. “You’re kind of unlocking or promoting the amplification of a basic physiological rhythm,” says Noble. He points out that this frequency can be found in the repetitive actions of many spiritual practices – such as the Ave Marias spoken in rosary prayers and the chanting of yogic mantras. Perhaps those practices evolved through an unconscious recognition of this restorative breathing rhythm and its capacity to send people into a relaxed but focused state of mind.

Besides improving cardiovascular health, the slower breathing rate of six breaths per minute also seems to be optimal for pain management, according to the study by Jafari. This may be due to the psychological comfort that comes from slow breathing, as much as any direct physiological changes to the pain sensitivity. “We believe psychological effects, in particular changing one’s attention and expectancies, play an important role in the analgesic effect of these techniques,” he says.
