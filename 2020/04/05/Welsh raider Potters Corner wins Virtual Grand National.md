(CNN) Potters Corner won Saturday's Virtual Grand National, foiling pre-race favorite Tiger Roll in his bid for an unprecedented third straight victory, in a computer simulation of the famous steeplechase that had been canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Ridden by 17-year-old Jack Tudor, the 18-1 shot held off a late challenge from Walk in the Mill, with a fading Tiger Roll having to settle for fourth place.

Using the latest CGI technology and special algorithms, the race was shown as live on UK terrestrial broadcaster ITV, with 40 runners bidding for virtual glory.

In the CGI version, Tiger Roll looked to have every chance of victory after shock frontrunner Aso took a heavy fall with two fences remaining, but fell away under top weight in the long run in to the finishing post at Aintree.
