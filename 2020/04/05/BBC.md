在希腊大陆的第二个移民营地，雅典北部的马拉卡萨旧设施，已经被隔离了14天，此前一名53岁的男子被检测出冠状病毒呈阳性。
周二证实了在大陆的一个难民营中的第一起案件。
另外六人也在莫里亚（Moria）营地的所在地莱斯博斯岛（Lesbos）进行了测试，那里有18,000人居住在为3,000人建造的设施中。
本周早些时候，英国广播公司（BBC）的人口通讯员斯蒂芬妮·黑格蒂（Stephanie Hegarty）报告了莫里亚人如何在几乎没有社交距离的环境中试图保护自己免受病毒的侵害。

A second migrant camp in mainland Greece, the old Malakasa facility north of Athens, has been quarantined for 14 days after a 53-year-old man tested positive for coronavirus.
The first case in a migrant camp on the mainland was confirmed on Tuesday.
Another six people also tested positive on the island of Lesbos, home to Moria camp, where 18,000 people are staying in a facility that was built for 3,000.
Earlier this week, the BBC's population correspondent Stephanie Hegarty reported on how people in Moria are trying to protect themselves from the virus in an environment with almost no prospect of social distancing.

内政部长称这起恐怖袭击是法国东南部发生的两人死亡，五人受伤的原因是刀击。
目击者称，袭击者进入格勒诺布尔附近的罗曼斯河畔伊泽尔镇的一名烟草贩子，刺伤了所有者和顾客。
检察官说，他们在星期六逮捕了第二人，据法国布鲁说，他与袭击者同住。
总统伊曼纽尔·马克龙（Emmanuel Macron）将这次袭击描述为“可憎的”事件，这进一步使一个已经在经历磨难的国家感到悲伤。
他在推特上说：“我的想法是对伊索尔河畔罗马人袭击的受害者-受伤者及其家人。”

Witnesses said the attacker entered a tobacconist in the town of Romans-sur-Isère, near Grenoble, and stabbed the owners and a customer.
Prosecutors said they arrested a second person on Saturday who, according to France Bleu, was living with the attacker.
President Emmanuel Macron described the attack as an "odious" incident that further saddened a country already going through an ordeal.
"My thoughts are with the victims of the Romans-sur-Isère attack - the injured, their families," he tweeted.

良好的计划，结构，创造力和灵活性都可以帮助您创建一个每个人都可以履行其义务的环境，同时保持家庭和睦。
传达家庭计划在充满孩子和父母的房子里，重要的是要现实地了解您的工作状况以及成功所需要的意志力-这意味着要花时间来解释正在发生的事情。
她解释说，在每个家庭成员的日程安排上保持透明可以使孩子们更容易理解您的出入限制。
“如果您想和孩子聊天以摆脱工作，这没关系，但是需要休息一下。”想分享您的经验或在家工作的秘诀吗？
（在新的限制措施将人们每天限制为一个外部锻炼时间之前，Jansen向英国广播公司发表了讲话。）

Good planning, structure, creativity and flexibility can all help you create an environment in which everyone can fulfil their obligations – while maintaining family harmony.
Communicate a family planWith a house full of kids and working parents, it’s important to be realistic about your working situation and the willpower it will take to succeed – and that means taking time to explain what’s happening.
Being transparent about every family member’s schedule can make it easier for children to understand when you’re off limits, she explains.
“It’s okay if you want to talk to your kids to take your mind off work, but it needs to be siloed to work breaks.”Want to share your experiences or tips working from home?
(Jansen spoke to the BBC before new restrictions came in limiting people to one external exercise period per day.)

一项受到密切关注的国际调查显示，冠状病毒大流行可能引发比1930年代大萧条更大的全球衰退。
采购经理人指数数据显示，包括英国，美国和欧元区在内的主要地理区域的制造业和服务业3月份活动均创历史新低。
数据由IHS Markit和特许采购与供应协会（CIPS）发布。
IHS Markit说：“自从2012年7月首次获得数据以来，对未来的信心是该调查记录的最低水平。”
至于英国的数字，他说：“总而言之：太可怕了，可能并没有反映出整个灾难。”

The data is published by IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS).
“Confidence about the future was the lowest recorded by the survey since data were first available in July 2012,” said IHS Markit.
As for the UK figures, he said: "In one line: horrendous, and probably not reflecting the full devastation."

The 3.5% unemployment rate in February was hovering near historic lows.

## 为什么呼吸慢可以帮助您放松

### Why slowing your breathing helps you relax

同样重要的是，心脏周围动脉中的压力敏感压力感受器会进入迷走神经。
在长时间的呼气过程中，通过反复刺激迷走神经，缓慢的呼吸可能会使神经系统移向更安静的状态，从而导致积极的变化，例如心率降低和血压降低。
（要了解迷走神经及其在关节炎，糖尿病和心血管疾病等疾病中的作用的更多信息，请阅读Gaia Vince在Mosaic上发表的深入文章，或听她的广播纪录片。）
也许这些做法是通过无意识地意识到这种恢复性呼吸节奏及其将人们带入轻松但专注的精神状态的能力而发展起来的。
这可能是由于呼吸缓慢带来的心理舒适性以及对疼痛敏感性的任何直接生理变化。

Just as importantly, the pressure-sensitive baroreceptors, in the arteries around the heart, feed into the vagus nerve.
By repeatedly stimulating the vagus nerve during those long exhalations, slow breathing may shift the nervous system towards that more restful state, resulting in positive changes like a lower heart rate and lower blood pressure.
(To find out more about the vagus nerve and its role in conditions like arthritis, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, read Gaia Vince’s in-depth article at Mosaic, or listen to her radio documentary.)
Perhaps those practices evolved through an unconscious recognition of this restorative breathing rhythm and its capacity to send people into a relaxed but focused state of mind.
This may be due to the psychological comfort that comes from slow breathing, as much as any direct physiological changes to the pain sensitivity.

## 糖真的对你有害吗？

现在很难想象，但是有一段时间人们正好在一年中只有几个月的时间里获取糖。
现在，我们的糖一年四季都来了，通常只需打开一瓶软饮料或麦片盒即可，其营养价值通常更低，而且更容易食用。
不需要专家就可以证明我们的现代食糖摄入量不如我们的觅食时期健康。
但是研究人员还得出结论，当高糖摄入与过量卡路里结合使用时，这种情况最容易发生，而且对健康的影响“更有可能”是由于糖摄入增加了过量卡路里的机会，而不仅仅是糖的影响。
糖，也称为“添加糖”，包括食用糖，甜味剂，蜂蜜和果汁，经过提取，精制并添加到食品和饮料中以改善口感。

It’s hard to imagine now, but there was a time when humans only had access to sugar for a few months a year when fruit was in season.
Now, our sugar hits come all year round, often with less nutritional value and far more easily – by simply opening a soft drink or cereal box.
It doesn’t take an expert to see that our modern sugar intake is less healthy than it was in our foraging days.
But the researchers also concluded that this occurs most often when high sugar intake is combined with excess calories, and that the effects on health are "more likely" due to sugar intake increasing the chance of excess calories, not the impact of sugar alone.
Sugar, otherwise known as "added sugar", includes table sugar, sweeteners, honey and fruit juices, and is extracted, refined and added to food and drink to improve taste.

喜剧演员罗曼什·兰加纳森（Romesh Ranganathan）选择了亚恩·马特尔（Yann Martel）迷人的畅销书《 Pi生活》。
小说讲述了皮特·帕特尔（Pi Patel）的故事，他是一个在海上漂流数月的男孩，被困在一条带老虎的救生艇上。
随着冒险的进行以及Pi与老虎的刀锋关系（由于管理员错误，他被命名为Richard Parker），这种关系变得越来越引人注目。
Ranganathan说：“因为这是一个与您建立了关系并真正了解的脆弱的小男孩，这让我感到更加恐惧。”
最后还有惊人的转折……但是您必须阅读这本书（好吧，或者看电影大片改编）以了解它的含义。

Stand-up comedian Romesh Ranganathan picks Yann Martel’s enchanting bestseller Life of Pi.
The novel tells the story of Pi Patel, a boy who spends months adrift at sea, trapped on a lifeboat with a tiger.
As the adventure unfolds, and Pi’s knife-edge relationship with the tiger (who’s named Richard Parker, thanks to an admin error) develops, it becomes increasingly compelling.
“Because it’s this fragile little boy that you’ve formed a relationship with and got to really know, it just feels all the more scary,” says Ranganathan.
There’s also a stunning twist towards the end… but you’ll have to read the book (okay, or watch the blockbuster film adaptation) to find out what it is.

1848年，詹姆斯·W·马歇尔（James W Marshall）在旧金山以北的山丘中发现了黄金，这引发了史诗般的规模迁移。
不知何故，这种面包比其他地方味道更鲜，更香，因此诞生了旧金山酸面团。
170多年后的今天，旧金山是酸面包的代名词。
旧金山和酸面包之间的另一个联系是：该地区长期存在的，注重原料的精神。
他们碰巧遇到了当时未被列入目录的细菌，因此给它起了一个名字：旧金山的乳酸杆菌，继旧金山之后，仍然认为它是海湾地区特有的。

When James W Marshall discovered gold in the hills north of San Francisco in 1848, it sparked a migration of epic proportions.
Somehow, the bread tasted tangier and more flavourful than it did elsewhere, and thus San Francisco sourdough was born.
More than 170 years later, San Francisco is synonymous with sourdough bread.
Another link between San Francisco and sourdough bread: the region’s long-running, ingredients-focused ethos.
They happened upon a then-uncatalogued bacterium, so they gave it a name: lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, after San Francisco, still believing it was Bay Area-unique.

在割草机运转之前，请确保草在积极生长。
理想情况下，将有两到三英寸的生长，以避免伤害草和根部。
选择干燥的一天，然后先修剪一下割草机刀片。
整理边缘也将带来巨大的变化，因此，如果您没有任何阴影，请使用铁锹锐化边框边缘，或抓住一些大剪刀，将手和膝盖放下并进行剪裁！

Make sure your grass is actively growing before giving the mower a run around.
Ideally there will be between two and three inches of growth, to avoid injuring the grass and any infection of the roots.
Choose a dry day and give your mower blades a sharpen-up first.
Neatening up the edges will also make a huge difference so, if you don’t have a strimmer, use a spade to sharpen the border edges, or grab some large scissors, get down on your hands and knees and get snipping\!

很好地包装食物并消除暴露在空气中将有助于保持其风味和质地。
试图将一包从超市扔进冰箱，但重新包装食物可能会得到更好的结果，因此将空气暴露的可能性降到最低。
通过使用冷冻袋，可以确保除去所有多余的空气，并且它们占用的空间最小。
给盒子或袋子贴标签时，请使用上表确定使用日期，并将其写在标签上。
而且，当然，在将食物放入冰箱之前，请务必确保其已完全冷却（理想情况下已冷藏）。

Wrapping food well and eliminating exposure to air will help keep its flavour and texture.
It’s tempting to throw a packet from the supermarket into the freezer, but you may get better results from rewrapping the food so there’s minimum of exposure to air.
By using freezer bags, you can ensure all excess air is removed, and they take up the minimum of space.
When you label a box or bag, use the table above to work out the use-by date, and write this on the label.
And, of course, always ensure food is completely cooled (ideally refrigerated) before you put it in the freezer.
