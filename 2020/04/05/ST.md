据《星报》报道，柔佛州移民局预计，在共和国宣布采取更为严格的措施来应对Covid-19大流行之后，目前正在新加坡居住的更多马来西亚人将返回家园。
他在星期六（4月4日）说：“该部门预计，在4月1日至14日之间，与3月18日至31日相比，会有大量的马来西亚人返回家园。”
返回马来西亚的人应首先在新加坡接受棉签测试，然后在马来西亚的入境点出示测试证书。
MCO有效期至4月14日，以遏制大流行，要求将所有从国外返回的马来西亚人隔离14天。
在3月18日实施该命令之前，估计每天有300,000马来西亚人从柔佛州通勤到新加坡工作。

JOHOR BARU - The Johor Immigration Department is expecting more Malaysians currently staying in Singapore to return home after the Republic announced significantly stricter measures to address the Covid-19 pandemic, The Star reported.
"The department is expecting to see a high number of Malaysians returning home between April 1 and 14 compared with March 18 to 31," he said on Saturday (April 4).
The returning Malaysians should first undergo a swab test in Singapore and then present the test certificate at the entry point in Malaysia.
The MCO, which is in force until April 14 to contain the pandemic, requires all Malaysians returning from abroad to be isolated for 14 days.
Before the order was implemented on March 18, an estimated 300,000 Malaysians commuted from Johor daily to work in Singapore.

## 德国例外？为什么该国的冠状病毒死亡率低

### A German exception? Why the country's coronavirus death rate is low

死亡率低的另一个解释是，德国的测试人数远远超过大多数国家。
“我们在重症监护领域非常强大。”
在德国各地，医院都扩大了重症监护能力。
一月份，德国约有28,000张配有呼吸机的重症监护病床，每10万人中有34张。
到现在为止，德国有40,000张重症监护病床。

Another explanation for the low fatality rate is that Germany has been testing far more people than most nations.
"We are very strong in the intensive care area."
All across Germany, hospitals have expanded their intensive care capacities.
In January, Germany had some 28,000 intensive care beds equipped with ventilators, or 34 per 100,000 people.
By now, there are 40,000 intensive care beds available in Germany.

纽约（路透社）-州长安德鲁·库莫（Andrew Cuomo）周六（4月4日）表示，与冠状病毒相关的疾病在纽约州的最后一天造成630人死亡，这是该州遭受大流行打击最严重的24小时。
美国的Covid-19（冠状病毒引起的类似流感的呼吸道疾病）的已知病例数量是世界上最多的。
据路透社统计，在美国有超过30万人的测试呈阳性，有8100多人死亡。
在约翰·霍普金斯大学统计的美国冠状病毒死亡人数中，仅纽约市就占了四分之一以上。
由于存在感染的风险，纽约市许多重病亲戚的人在最后几个小时都无法见到亲人。

NEW YORK (REUTERS) - Coronavirus-related illnesses killed 630 people in the last day in New York state, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Saturday (April 4), in the bleakest 24 hours yet for the US state hit hardest by the pandemic.
The United States has the world's highest number of known cases of Covid-19, the flu-like respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.
More than 300,000 people have tested positive in the United States and over 8,100 have died, according to a Reuters tally.
New York City alone accounted for more than a quarter of the US coronavirus deaths tallied by Johns Hopkins University.
Because of the risk of infection, many people with critically ill relatives in New York City are unable to see their loved ones in their final hours.

北京（路透社）-中国大陆周六（4月4日）报告了30例新的冠状病毒病例，较一天前的19例有所增加，原因是涉及国外旅客以及本地传播的病例数量有所增加。
国家卫生委员会在周日的一份声明中说，周六报告的病例中有25起涉及从国外进入该国的人，而一天前报告的此类病例有18起。
大陆目前报告了81,669例，死亡人数上升了3到3,329。
随着病毒在全球的传播，中国已经对几乎所有外国人关闭了边境，尽管大多数进口病例都涉及从海外归国的中国人。

华盛顿（路透社）-美国总统唐纳德·特朗普周六（4月4日）表示，如果他必须“保护”美国能源工人免受石油价格崩盘的冲击，他将对原油进口征收关税，俄罗斯和沙特阿拉伯之间的战争加剧了石油价格崩盘。超过市场份额。
由于大流行抑制了需求，以及主要生产国俄罗斯和沙特阿拉伯在争夺市场份额的战争中提高了产量，今年油价已下跌了约三分之二。
随着油价下跌，许多杠杆率很高的美国能源公司面临破产，工人面临裁员的风险。
根据美国能源情报署的数据，2019年美国每天从俄罗斯和沙特阿拉伯进口的石油合计超过100万桶。
上个月油价开始下跌时，特朗普最初强调这对驾车​​者来说是件好事。

WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - US President Donald Trump said on Saturday (April 4) he would impose tariffs on crude imports if he has to "protect" US energy workers from the oil price crash that has been exacerbated by a war between Russia and Saudi Arabia over market share.
Oil prices have dropped by about two-thirds this year as the pandemic crushes demand and as major producers Russia and Saudi Arabia boost output in a war over market share.
As oil prices drop, many heavily leveraged US energy companies face bankruptcies and workers are at risk of layoffs.
The United States imported more 1 million barrels per day of oil from Russia and Saudi Arabia combined in 2019, according to the US Energy Information Administration.
When oil prices started dropping last month, Trump initially emphasised it would be good for motorists.

曼谷（法新社）-停工以遏制冠状病毒杀死了泰国的派对现场，迫使像皮姆这样的性工作者离开酒吧进入荒凉的街道。
据估计，这已经使300,000名性工作者失业，迫使一些人流落街头，大流行病使这些危险更加严重。
曼谷的许多性工作者在酒吧的相对安全部门工作，为小费工作并愿意与顾客一起回家。
王国王国性工作者的倡导组织Empower Foundation说，娱乐场所每年的收入约为64亿美元，其中许多场所以某种形式出售性行为。
许多人是母亲及其家庭的主要收入来源，由于缺乏机会或毕业生工资低而被迫从事性工作。

BANGKOK (AFP) - A shutdown to contain the coronavirus has killed Thailand's party scene and forced sex workers like Pim out of bars and onto desolate streets.
That has left an estimated 300,000 sex workers out of a job, pressing some onto the streets, where the risks are sharpened by the pandemic.
Many of Bangkok's sex workers had jobs in the relative safety of bars, working for tips and willing to go home with customers.
The Empower Foundation, an advocacy group for the kingdom's sex workers, says entertainment venues make around US$6.4 billion a year, many of them selling sex in some form.
Many are mothers and their family's main income earner, forced into sex work by lack of opportunities or low graduate salaries.

法国罗曼-苏尔-伊泽尔省（AFP）-周六（4月4日），一名苏丹难民在法国东南部一个小镇上持刀横冲直撞，在被视为恐怖袭击的事件中炸死了2人。
镇长玛丽·海伦·索拉瓦尔（Marie-Helene Thoraval）告诉法新社：“任何不幸遇难的人都遭到了袭击。”
PNAT说，这名嫌疑人于2017年获得难民身份，法国或欧洲的警察或情报部门并不知道。
自2015年在巴黎发生一波致命炸弹和枪击事件以来，该国一直处于恐怖警报状态。
在法国，总共有258人被杀，这被认为是恐怖袭击。

ROMANS-SUR-ISÈRE, FRANCE (AFP) - A Sudanese refugee went on a knife rampage in a town in south-eastern France on Saturday (April 4), killing two people in what is being treated as a terrorist attack.
"Anyone who had the misfortune to find themselves in his way were attacked," town mayor Marie-Helene Thoraval told AFP.
The suspect, who obtained refugee status in 2017, was not known to police or intelligence services in France or Europe, PNAT said.
The country has been on terror alert since a wave of deadly bombings and shootings in Paris in 2015.
In all, 258 people have been killed in France in what have been deemed terrorist attacks.

新加坡-如果您在Facebook，Instagram或Twitter上看到有关“卡罗尔如何完全将丈夫喂老虎的食物”或“我的老板从乔·埃奇特（Joe Exotic）上学到管理课程”的笑话和推荐，人们在谈论Netflix的纪录片《老虎王：谋杀》，混乱和疯狂。
自3月20日在流媒体服务上推出以来，观众为一个真实的故事所振奋，其中包括：大型猫科动物，复仇谋杀案，突击步枪，美国一夫多妻制，以及最为重要的人物角色， “华丽”一词不能伸张正义。

SINGAPORE - If you see jokes and references on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter about how "Carole totally fed her husband to tigers" or "My boss takes management lessons from Joe Exotic", people are talking about the Netflix documentary series Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem And Madness.
Since it launched on the streaming service on March 20, viewers have been thrilled by a true story that has everything: big cats, a revenge murder plot, assault rifles, polygamy American-style and, most of all, a cast of characters for whom the word "flamboyant" fails to do justice.

伦敦（路透社）-伊丽莎白女王将呼吁英国人表现出与前人相同的决心，并在周日发表极为罕见的讲话集结全国团结时坚决地承担起冠状病毒爆发所带来的挑战和破坏（ 4月5日）。
“我希望在未来的几年中，每个人都能以他们对这一挑战的反应方式感到自豪。
“自律，安静的幽默感和同情心的特征仍然是这个国家的特征。”
本周早些时候，伊丽莎白的儿子和现年71岁的查尔斯王子（Charles Prince）经过积极的测试，经过7天的自我隔离。
女王通常只用她每年的电视转播的圣诞节讯息向全国广播，而这个特别的地址只是她所作的第五个。

LONDON (REUTERS) - Queen Elizabeth will call on Britons to show the same resolve as their forebears and take on the challenge and disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak with good-humoured resolve when she makes an extremely rare address to rally the nation on Sunday (April 5).
"I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge.
"That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humoured resolve and of fellow-feeling still characterise this country."
Earlier this week, Elizabeth's son and heir Prince Charles, 71, came out of self-isolation himself after seven days following a positive test.
The queen usually only broadcasts to the nation with her annual televised Christmas Day message and this special address will be only the fifth she has made.

马德里（法新社）-西班牙总理周四（4月4日）宣布延长该国打击冠状病毒封锁的禁令，称由于死亡人数连续第二天下降，该措施正在“取得成果”。
大量冠状病毒患者使医院，特别是重症监护室不堪重负。
然而，西班牙周六记录冠状病毒相关死亡连续第二天下降，死亡人数为809人。
该国的死亡总数为11,744人，仅次于意大利。
但他说，“现在改善病情会带来更糟的后果”，并警告说感染是“第二波”。

MADRID (AFP) - Spain's prime minister announced on Saturday (April 4) an extension of the country's lockdown to combat the coronavirus, saying the measures are "bearing fruit" as the number of deaths fell for a second day in a row.
Hospitals, in particular the intensive care units, have been overwhelmed by an influx of coronavirus patients.
However, Spain on Saturday recorded a second successive daily fall in coronavirus-related deaths with 809 fatalities.
The total number of deaths in the country stands at 11,744, second only to Italy.
But to "ease up now would have a worse result," he said, warning of a "second wave" of infections.

由于大多数英国人被限制在自己的家中，并且所有注意力都集中在与冠状病毒大流行作斗争上，因此几乎没有人注意到工党的言论或所作所为。

Britain's Labour party, the country's main opposition, could have not have chosen a worse time to hold its leadership election.

Mr Verga, who works in finance, lives in the Novena area with his wife, Laura, 31.
After Monday's success, many people got in contact with him, expressing their amazement at how the event had taken off, says Mr Verga.
Until we can come out the other side, it's not too much to ask for everyone to (show their appreciation this way)," says Mr Verga.
There are really so many things you can do, such as volunteer or donate spare cash," says Mr Verga.
