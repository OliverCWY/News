台湾也避免了中国和许多其他国家的反应所特有的严格封锁措施。
但是，包括台湾官员在内的许多观察家声称，这在非典流行期间和当前的危机中都产生了负面影响。
但是，援助是双向的，近几周来，台湾官员反复抱怨说，他们被世界卫生组织排除在外，阻止了台湾在全球反应中充分发挥作用。
“根据公认的安排，每年，世卫组织与台湾当局和专家就重要的公共卫生和科学问题进行互动。
世卫组织正在吸取包括台湾卫生当局在内的各个领域的经验教训。”

Taiwan also avoided the type of strict lockdowns that characterized the response in China and many other countries.
However, numerous observers, including Taiwanese officials, have claimed that it has had a negative effect both during the SARS epidemic and the current crisis.
Assistance goes in both directions, however, and in recent weeks, Taiwanese officials have repeatedly complained that their exclusion from the WHO is preventing the island playing its full part in the global response.
"Every year, WHO and Taiwanese authorities and experts interact on vital public health and scientific issues, according to well-established arrangements.
WHO is taking lessons learned from all areas, including Taiwanese health authorities."

总部位于迈阿密的皇家加勒比海地区一部分“名人无限”号上的一名船员告诉美国有线电视新闻网，上周有一名船员在船上死亡。
梅利姆说，她是900多名被困在坦帕海岸附近的船员之一。
菲什曼回答说：“我们一直与政府和公共卫生当局保持联系，并赞赏他们在保护机组人员健康方面的指导。
“我们像乘务人员聚会一样，我们有现场音乐表演，我们有音乐会，电影之夜，戏剧表演，”梅利姆说。
每当有人提出问题时，这都是普遍的回答：这艘船是最安全的地方。”

A crew member aboard the Celebrity Infinity, part of Miami-based Royal Caribbean, told CNN that one crew member died on board the ship last week.
Melim says she is one of more than 900 crew, who are stuck off the coast of Tampa.
Fishman responded:"We are in continuous contact with government and public health authorities and appreciate their guidance in protecting the health of our crewmembers.
“We had like crew parties, we had live music, we had concerts, movie nights, theater performances," alleges Melim.
Anytime anyone raised a question, it was the general response: the ship is the safest place to be," she said.

（CNN）纽约市的学校在审查安全问题后不再使用视频会议应用程序Zoom。
该市女发言人丹尼尔·菲尔森（Danielle Filson）在CNN声明中说，该市教育部指示学校“尽快取消使用Zoom”。
菲尔森说：“远程学习有许多新的组成部分，我们正在根据员工和学生的最大利益做出实时决策。”
菲尔森说，该部门没有与Zoom签订中央合同，学生和教职员工将过渡到Microsoft团队，后者具有“相同的功能，并已采取适当的安全措施。”
本周早些时候，联邦官员开始警告新的潜在的隐私和安全隐患，即“ Zoombombing”。

(CNN) Schools in New York City are moving away from using the video conference app Zoom after a review of security concerns.
The city's Department of Education is directing schools to "move away from using Zoom as soon as possible," Danielle Filson, a department spokeswoman, told CNN in a statement.
"There are many new components to remote learning, and we are making real-time decisions in the best interest of our staff and student," Filson said.
The department does not have a central contract with Zoom, Filson said, and students and staff will be transitioning to Microsoft Teams, which has "the same capabilities with appropriate security measures in place."
Earlier this week, federal officials began warning of a new potential privacy and security concern called "Zoombombing."

Several European governments have sounded the alarm about the difficulty of obtaining protective equipment for health workers.
In Spain, labor unions have complained about a lack of protective equipment for health workers.

（CNN）一名佛罗里达州的消防员在接受冠状病毒住院期间从其工作人员那里收到了令人心动的惊喜。
消防员把梯子抬到他四楼的医院窗户上。
周五早上，工作人员乘坐消防车驶往医院，将梯子抬到医院的四楼窗户，并举起Get Well Soon卡和标有“ Your New Firehouse”的标语。

The firefighters raised a ladder to his fourth-floor hospital window.
The crew drove to the hospital on Friday morning in their fire truck, raised their ladder to the hospital's fourth floor window, and held up Get Well Soon cards and a sign that read: "Your New Firehouse."
There's just no other way to explain how this makes me feel," the unnamed Miami-Dade firefighter said about the sweet gesture.
The firefighter, who has been in the hospital for over a week, said he felt "joyful" and "instantly connected" to his team the moment he received their special visit.

据意大利医生联合会称，北部省份的10,000多名医护人员已感染该病毒，原因是缺乏适当的防护设备，导致医疗机构内部的传染病蔓延。
Michele Monti上校回应了电话并告诉CNN，虽然他将其视为“孤立事件”，但消息很明确。
蒙蒂告诉美国有线电视新闻网：“这不是暴力，二十个人装满了他们的购物车，他们不想付钱，所以我们进行了干预，他们平静地离开了食物。”
在黑手党博客上写了自己的恐惧之后，他对CNN说：“黑手党正在煽风点火，并将很快点燃这种大火。”
反黑手党检察官费德里科·德·拉霍（Federico De Raho）告诉美国有线电视新闻网，社会不安是社会动荡的温床。

More than 10,000 health care workers in the northern provinces have been infected with the virus, according to the Italian Doctor's Federation, as a lack of proper protective gear made contagion inside healthcare facilities a contributor to the rampant spread.
Col. Michele Monti responded to the call and told CNN that while he viewed it as an "isolated incident" the message was clear.
"It wasn't violent, and the 20 people filled their carts said they didn't want to pay so we intervened and they calmly left without the food," Monti told CNN.
"The mafia is fanning the flames and will soon ignite this fire," he told CNN, after he wrote about his fears on his blog.
Anti-mafia prosecutor Federico De Raho told CNN that social unease is the breeding ground for social unrest.

（CNN）本周，委内瑞拉一艘海军船只在该国北部沿海与一艘客轮相撞，并输掉了一场战斗，撞了几次，然后意外下水并下沉。
这艘德国拥有的RCGS Resolute游轮的所有人称，该船已在星期二上午在国际水域接受维修，当时武装海军船驶近并命令其改变方向。
据该公司称，当“开枪射击，此后不久，海军舰艇以135度角的速度驶向右舷并故意与RCGS Resolute相撞时，遭遇升级。”
哥伦比亚邮轮服务公司的声明说：“海军舰船继续向右舷撞船，显然是试图将船头转向委内瑞拉领海。”
但是，RCGS Resolute用钢板加固，可帮助其在冰中航行。

(CNN) A Venezuelan naval boat picked and lost a fight with a passenger cruise liner off the country's northern coast this week, ramming it several times before accidentally taking on water and sinking.
The proprietors of the German-owned RCGS Resolute cruise ship said its vessel had been receiving maintenance in international waters on Tuesday morning when the armed navy boat approached it and ordered it to change direction.
The encounter escalated when, according to the company, "gun shots were fired and, shortly thereafter, the navy vessel approached the starboard side at speed with an angle of 135 degrees and purposely collided with the RCGS Resolute."
"The navy vessel continued to ram the starboard bow in an apparent attempt to turn the ship's head towards Venezuelan territorial waters," Columbia Cruise Services' statement read.
However, the RCGS Resolute is reinforced with steel plating to help it navigate through ice.

But then, in early March, Patel met with executives from Marriott, the brand many of his hotels operate under, to discuss business.
The hotel business there had plummeted amid the coronavirus outbreak.

由编剧转变为小说家的作家在2005年写了一本名为《锁定》的书，内容涉及全球大流行。
该书当时因太过现实而遭到出版商的拒绝，最终于周四出版。
惊悚片设在伦敦，这是全球大流行的中心，迫使官员们进行封锁。
他使用2002年以来的英美两国的大流行防备文件，使之尽可能切合实际。
梅告诉美国有线电视新闻网：“在我写这本书的时候，科学家们预测禽流感将是下一个世界大流行。”

The screenwriter-turned-novelist wrote a book titled " Lockdown " in 2005 about a global pandemic.
The book, which was rejected by publishers at the time for being too unrealistic, was finally published on Thursday.
The thriller is set in London, the epicenter of a global pandemic that forces officials to institute a lockdown.
He used British and US pandemic preparedness documents from 2002 to make it was as realistic as possible.
"At the time I wrote the book, scientists were predicting that bird flu was going to be the next major world pandemic," May told CNN.

华盛顿海岸警卫队星期五晚上说，在肯尼迪家族的两名成员-Maeve Kennedy McKean和她的儿子Gideon的搜查被中止26小时后，据报道他们在马里兰州安纳波利斯附近的切萨皮克湾失踪。

汤森在一份声明中说：“我深感悲伤，分享了一个消息，对我心爱的女儿梅夫（Maeve）和孙子吉迪恩（Gideon）的搜寻已从救援变成了康复。”

Washington (CNN) The search for two members of the Kennedy family -- Maeve Kennedy McKean and her son, Gideon -- was suspended 26 hours after they were reported missing in the Chesapeake Bay near Annapolis, Maryland, the Coast Guard said Friday night.
Matthew Fine, deputy sector commander and active search suspension authority at Sector Maryland-National Capitol Region command center, late Friday night.
We've kept the family informed at every step during the search, and our thoughts are with them tonight."
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, McKean's mother, said earlier in the evening that the search had turned from a rescue to a recovery mission.
"With profound sadness, I share the news that the search for my beloved daughter Maeve and grandson Gideon has turned from rescue to recovery," Townsend said in a statement.

越来越少的人在外面闲逛。
全球遏制冠状病毒传播的遏制措施似乎使世界变得更加安静。
在世界各地，地震学家正在观察到的环境地震噪声要少得多，这意味着汽车，火车，公共汽车和人们日常生活中产生的振动。
而且在没有这种噪音的情况下，地球的上地壳运动的程度略微降低了。
他说，这个噪音水平与地震学家在圣诞节那天看到的水平相当。

And fewer and fewer people can be found milling about outside.
Global containment measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus have seemingly made the world much quieter.
Around the world, seismologists are observing a lot less ambient seismic noise -- meaning, the vibrations generated by cars, trains, buses and people going about their daily lives.
And in the absence of that noise, Earth's upper crust is moving just a little less.
That noise level is on par with what seismologists would see on Christmas Day, he said.

亚特兰大（CNN）这是一个很多人都想回答的问题：究竟有多少人从Covid-19中康复？
多诺万说：“在中国境外发现的病例是基于当地媒体报道的国家一级的估计，可能大大低于实际数字。”
根据约翰·霍普金斯大学（Johns Hopkins University）仪表板的数据，截至周六，全球已有223,000人从Covid-19中康复。
迄今为止，没有证据表明从Covid-19中恢复的人可以被新型冠状病毒再次感染-尽管总体上没有很多数据，Hota说。
“这是一个未被充分研究的群体，” Hota关于康复的Covid-19患者说。

Atlanta (CNN) It's a question that many want answered: Exactly how many people recover from Covid-19?
"Recovered cases outside China are country-level estimates based on local media reports and may be substantially lower than the true number," Donovan said.
As of Saturday, more than 223,000 people worldwide have recovered from Covid-19, according to data from the Johns Hopkins University dashboard.
There's no evidence to date that people who recover from Covid-19 can get re-infected with the novel coronavirus -- though there isn't a lot of data in general, Hota said.
"This is a little bit of an understudied group," Hota said about recovered Covid-19 patients.

游轮停飞。
全球疫情爆发后，航空公司立即采取了严厉的措施，从平凡的措施（如暂停热毛巾服务）到极端的措施（如给整个飞机喷洒消毒剂）。
那么，乘客将来会期望什么使他们对疾病的传播放心呢？
显然，飞机通过跨大陆运送受感染的乘客来加速了病毒的传播，但在机舱内传播的风险却鲜为人知。
“与飞机不同，游轮是疾病的巨大孵化器。

Cruise ships are grounded.
In the immediate wake of the global outbreak, airlines adopted stringent measures ranging from the mundane, like suspending hot towel service, to the extreme, like fogging an entire aircraft with disinfectant.
So what can passengers expect in the future to give them peace of mind about the spread of disease?
While it's clear that planes have accelerated the spread of the virus by transporting infected passengers across continents, the risks of transmission within the cabin are less known.
"Unlike airplanes, cruise ships are massive incubators of disease.

## 文艺复兴时期内阁的丰富宝藏

以下是新书《内阁》的摘录，其中描述了包含精美物品的文艺复兴时期房间如何成为现代博物馆的前身。
好奇心的内阁是惊奇与惊喜，奇观和稀有物品的代名词，同时也是整个世界的镜像和代表。
乌菲兹美术馆（Uffizi Gallery）乌菲兹美术馆（Uffizi Gallery）本身是作为好奇心而创建的，也就是说是一个奇幻的地方。
皮蒂宫然而，意大利最美丽，最重要的好奇心是在佛罗伦萨的皮蒂宫。
如今，好奇的内阁今天要问的是，好奇的内阁这个概念是否仍然存在于当今收藏家的想象力和抱负中，以及这种杂乱，奢侈的收藏背后的冲动是否一直持续到现在。

The following are edited excerpts from the new book " Cabinet of Curiosities ," which describe how Renaissance rooms containing wonderful objects were precursors to the modern museum.
The cabinet of curiosities is synonymous with delight and surprise, with marvels and rare objects, but is also the mirror and representation of the world in its entirety.
The Uffizi GalleryThe Uffizi Gallery was itself created as a cabinet of curiosities, that is to say a place of wonders.
Pitti PalaceHowever the most beautiful and most important cabinet of curiosities in Italy is in the Pitti Palace in Florence.
Cabinets of curiosities todayIt is fair to ask whether the notion of the cabinet of curiosities still exists in the imagination and aspirations of today's collectors, and whether the impulse behind such omnivorous, extravagant collecting has survived until the present.

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
后来空袭被认为是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

## 木摩天大楼革命终于到来了吗？

### Has the wooden skyscraper revolution finally arrived?

Mjøstårnet的高度达到280英尺，于去年开放后成为世界上最高的木材建筑。
长期倡导和设计木制建筑的建筑师Michael Green表示，“现在有很多东西在融合。”
Or Framework是位于俄勒冈州波特兰的一座雄心勃勃的148英尺高的木塔，在去年因成本担忧而被取消之前，该塔被设定为美国最高的木塔。
考虑到在2018年之前，俄勒冈州成为美国第一个允许使用18层木制建筑的州，而在美国，没有任何地方允许任何超过6层的建筑物，这一决定意义重大。
该组织表示，除了担心森林砍伐外，洒水喷头不能有效防止烈焰扩散到木结构建筑中。

Reaching 280 feet in height, Mjøstårnet became the world's tallest timber building upon opening last year.
According to architect Michael Green, a longstanding advocate for -- and designer of -- wooden buildings, there are "a whole bunch of things converging right now."
Or Framework, an ambitious 148-foot-tall timber tower in Portland, Oregon, that was set to be the USA's tallest wooden tower before was canceled amid cost concerns last year.
The decision is significant given that, before 2018, when Oregon became the first US state to allow 18-story wooden buildings, nowhere in America permitted anything higher than six.
In addition to concerns about deforestation, the group says sprinklers are ineffective at preventing blazes from spreading through wood buildings.
