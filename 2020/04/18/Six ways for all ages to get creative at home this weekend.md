Sadler’s Wells is creating a series of online workshops and activities for audiences to dance along to in their own homes.

The Company of Elders workshop series is specially created for over 60s who may be staying at home due to social distancing, with a new film scheduled to be released every Wednesday.

And at the other end of the spectrum, the Family Dance workshops have been specially created for families with younger children now unable to attend nursery or school.
