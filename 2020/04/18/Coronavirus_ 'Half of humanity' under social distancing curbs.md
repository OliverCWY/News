The UK doesn’t currently have the capacity to produce the amount of vaccine it needs to tackle coronavirus, but “is in a really good place” for vaccine development, according to Prof John Bell, a member of the UK government's vaccine task force.

Asked about the possibility of a vaccine being produced by the autumn, Mr Bell said the real question was whether it would be effective, adding that "we won’t get a signal for that until May".

"The crucial thing is you have to do a proper trial because safety is really important for these things," he said.

"But if we can see evidence of a strong immune response by the middle or the end of May, then I think the game is on.

"And they may well get across the finish line by mid-August."
