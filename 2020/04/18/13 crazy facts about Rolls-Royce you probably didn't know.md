As you can imagine, when Rolls-Royce is making eye-wateringly expensive land yachts for the world’s elite, some pretty potty stats, facts and stories come out of this rather unique process. And you’re not wrong. So we’ve collated some of the wildest stories we’ve heard then had them corroborated by Rolls itself – so there’s no fake news here, peeps.

Unfortunately, we cannot confirm or deny whether this commission was for Bill Oddie.
