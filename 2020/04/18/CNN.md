Kwon说，KCDC重新调查了来自同一家庭的三例患者，这些患者康复后均呈阳性。

But church officials have been insistent that its traditional practices do no harm.

That's put Abbott in a difficult position of having to protect the Texas economy while heeding the warnings of epidemiologists.
Mr. Abbott alone is accountable for destroying the Texas economy," wrote Huffines.
Meanwhile, Texas Democrats are highlighting a recent investigative piece by the Houston Chronicle stating that Texas is near the bottom among the 50 states in per capita testing.
"As difficult as it may be, Texas must wait for the right time to reopen," said Manny Garcia, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party.

斯坦特和其他分析人士说，特朗普和普京在开会或进行讨论时经常将美国官员赶出。
“这是特朗普和普京相遇时的特征。
据美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）的统计，特朗普和普京至少在电话中通话了16次，并面对面了至少六次。
但是当特朗普和普京在赫尔辛基会面时，这种关系达到了最低点。

The calls have taken place as both Trump and Putin face domestic political challenges and offer the embattled leaders a way to claim wins.
Stent and other analysts say Trump and Putin have often squeezed out US officials when they've met or had discussions.
"This has been characteristic of Trump and Putin the times they've met.
Trump and Putin have spoken on the phone at least 16 times and met face-to-face at least six times, according to CNN's tally.
But the relationship hit a low point when Trump and Putin met in Helsinki.

在过去的几周里，日本的冠状病毒病例激增-希望政府的最初病毒反应能够成功控制其传播。
东京都政府称，4月12日，在东京中野区一家医院的医生，护士和住院病人中确认了87例新的冠状病毒病例。
在横滨，医务人员早川昭三最近几周在他的医院里看到冠状病毒患者稳定增加。
他说：“一旦对症状较轻的人进行检测，我们将可能发现更多的冠状病毒病例。”
卫生部发言人说：“由于我们尚未看到冠状病毒病例超标，因此我们将继续关注集群方法。”

In the past few weeks, Japan's coronavirus cases have spiked -- dashing hopes that the government's initial virus response had succeeded in controlling its spread.
On April 12, 87 new coronavirus cases were confirmed among doctors, nurses and inpatients at a hospital in Tokyo's Nakano ward, according to the Tokyo metropolitan government.
In Yokohama, paramedic Sho Hayakawa has seen a steady increase in coronavirus patients at his hospital in recent weeks.
"Once testing becomes available for people with more mild symptoms, we will likely see more coronavirus cases," he said.
"We are continuing to focus on the cluster approach as we are not seeing an overshoot in coronavirus cases yet," a health ministry spokesman said.

几周以来，克里斯蒂安·帕克（Christian Parker）一直在努力使用3D打印机和蓝图制作小型Y形塑料制品，以从华盛顿州的家中挽救整个美国的生命。
帕克（Parker）是3D打印的狂热者，对意大利人的故事着迷，当时人们在重要的医疗装备供不应求的情况下使用该技术帮助制造设备和保护性物品。
“ [我以为]如果我正坐在家里只是在修补我的3D打印机，或者它们闲置，我该怎么做才能跳出来并在可能的地方提供帮助？”
帕克说，在过去的一周中，他为美国各地的医院生产了至少40台呼吸机分配器。
简单的塑料管可将气流从单个呼吸机分配到多个患者，从而有助于扩大该国有限的呼吸机供应能力。

(CNN Business) For weeks, Christian Parker has been working to save lives across the United States from his home in Washington state using a 3D printer and a blueprint for a small, Y-shaped piece of plastic.
A 3D-printing enthusiast, Parker was fascinated by stories of people in Italy using the technology to help manufacture equipment and protective items at a time when supplies of important medical gear are running low.
"[I thought] if I'm sitting at home just tinkering with my 3D printers anyway, or they're sitting idle, what can I do to jump in and help out where I can?"
In the past week, Parker said he has produced at least 40 ventilator splitters for hospitals across the US.
The simple plastic pipe can help stretch the capabilities of the country's limited supply of ventilators by dividing the air flow from a single ventilator to multiple patients.

Baseball games in Taiwan, Japan and South Korea are usually incredibly noisy as cheerleaders dance to booming music and lead the crowds in singalongs.
"The club got these robot figures that play the drums during the games," Wang said.
Another thing Taiwan has never done before is broadcast games for free to the world -- in English.

"Don't feel sad ... just watch Taiwan professional baseball."

The 45-year-old inserted his MetaBank card in the ATM and made a withdrawal for the maximum amount of $200.
When he pulled out the receipt, he saw his account balance had a number with a lot of zeros behind it.

上周末，土耳其政府对31个省实施了48小时宵禁，影响了土耳其四分之三的人口。
面对冠状病毒，土耳其正在制定自己的道路-就像在许多其他方面一样。
实施为期两天的宵禁以阻止冠状病毒在伊斯坦布尔蔓延后，鸽子在空无一人的塔克西姆广场上飞来飞去。
Koca说，与其他国家不同，土耳其对抗Covid-19的方法围绕接触者追踪而不是常规测试或临床演示后的测试。
她能否真正看到它们有多快取决于土耳其的Covid-19战略是否是一次成功的赌博。

Last weekend, the Turkish government implemented a 48-hour curfew for 31 provinces, impacting three quarters of Turkey's population.
In confronting coronavirus, Turkey is charting its own path -- as it does in so many other ways.
Pigeons fly around a deserted Taksim Square after a two-day curfew imposed to stem the spread of coronavirus in Istanbul.
Koca says that, unlike other countries, Turkey's approach to fighting Covid-19 centers around contact tracing instead of general testing or testing after clinical presentation.
How soon she can actually see them will depend on whether or not Turkey's Covid-19 strategy is a successful gamble.

纽约（CNN商业）Vox Media是Vox，The Verge和New York杂志等网站的所有者，正在将其9％的员工休假三个月。
Vox Media目前拥有约1200名员工，导致约100名员工面临为期三个月的休假。
Vox Media将继续承保受影响人群的健康利益。
Vox Media首席执行官吉姆·班科夫（Jim Bankoff）周五在一份给CNN Business的备忘录中向员工宣布了这些变化。
Vox Media和New York Media（前者于去年收购）均已合并，这意味着管理层需要与每个谈判委员会就就业状况的任何变化进行谈判。

New York (CNN Business) Vox Media, owner of sites including Vox, The Verge and New York magazine, is furloughing about 9% of its employees for three months.
Vox Media currently employs about 1,200 people, resulting in about 100 people facing three-month furloughs.
Vox Media will continue to cover the health benefits of those affected.
Vox Media CEO Jim Bankoff announced the changes on Friday in a memo to staff that was obtained by CNN Business.
Vox Media and New York Media —which the former acquired last year — are both unionized, which means management is required to negotiate with each bargaining committee on any changes in employment status.

在许多保留地上，卫生保健设施已经长期资金不足，但是冠状病毒将有限的资源扩展到了边缘。
一场公共卫生危机迫使部落关闭了企业，而快速的经济衰退加剧了贫困。
这确实凸显了印度这个国家每天面临的障碍。”印度城市卫生国家委员会发言人梅雷迪思·赖蒙迪（Meredith Raimondi）说。
国会上个月通过的2.2万亿美元刺激计划包括印度事务5亿美元和部落80亿美元，但社区领导人表示这还不够。
在过去一个月给国会的信中，部落发出了警报，致信众议院自然资源委员会主席劳尔·格里雅尔瓦（Raul Grijalva），许多地区没有做好准备，也没有从联邦政府那里得到所需的东西。

On many reservations, health care facilities are already chronically underfunded, but coronavirus has stretched limited resources to the brink.
A public health crisis has forced tribes to close businesses and a rapid economic downturn has exasperated poverty.
It is really highlighting the barriers that Indian country faces every day," said Meredith Raimondi, a spokeswoman for the National Council of Urban Indian Health.
The $2.2 trillion stimulus package passed by Congress last month included $500 million for Indian Affairs and $8 billion for tribes, but community leaders say it isn't enough.
In letters to Congress over the last month, tribes have sounded the alarm, writing to Chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee Raul Grijalva that many areas were not prepared nor were they getting what they needed from the federal government.

（CNN）圣地亚哥的动漫展已经取消，这是最近一次受到Covid-19提出的关注的重大文化活动。
该公约表示计划在2021年7月的预定日期继续执行。
同样，WonderCon Anaheim（同一团体的另一次聚会）表示，其4月的会议将寻求在明年3月恢复。
尽管该活动起源于漫画的庆祝活动，但它已迅速发展成为各种流行文化的展示柜，包括电影和电视节目。
特别是电影制片厂已将此次活动变成了宣传即将上映电影的平台，由于公共卫生危机，这些电影也被推迟了。

(CNN) San Diego's Comic-Con has been canceled, the latest major cultural event to fall victim to concerns raised by Covid-19.
The convention stated its plans to continue at the scheduled date in July 2021.
Similarly, WonderCon Anaheim -- another gathering presented by the same group -- said its April convention would seek to resume in March of next year.
Although the event originated as a celebration of comic books, it has mushroomed into a showcase for all forms of popular culture, including movies and TV shows.
Movie studios, in particular, have turned the event into a platform to promote upcoming films, which have also been postponed because of the public-health crisis.

问题在于，我们面临的国家安全威胁没有暂停按钮。

Vinograd served on President Barack Obama's National Security Council from 2009 to 2013 and at the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush.
But there's one recovery they seem to be largely ignoring -- the national security one.
Limits to the national security apparatusResponding to the catastrophic impact of coronavirus requires a coordinated response at both the global and local levels.
And staff at key national security locations, like the Pentagon, are working on rotating schedules.
The problem is that there is no pause button on the national security threats we face.

## 具有颠覆性的嗡嗡声削减受到了大众需求的支持。这是从家中获得外观的方法

在其起源的军队之外，嗡嗡声削减长期以来一直是反文化的保留-反叛美学，授权和事件政治异议的象征。
的确，60年代后期的外观只是嗡嗡声。
但是剪短头发就像遵守古老而又庄重的社会规范。
好莱坞助推了这种形象：从《异形》中的西格妮·韦弗（Sigourney Weaver）到《 G.I Jane》中的黛米·摩尔（Demi Moore），发型成为了典型的坚强女人装。
布兰妮·斯皮尔斯（Britney Spear）在2007年臭名昭著的嗡嗡声削减中途走了一半。短暂的中断之后，嗡嗡声削减在2016年左右再次大受欢迎-想想克里斯汀·斯图尔特（Cristen Stewart）和卡拉·迪瓦伊（Cara Delevingne），罗伯特·帕丁森（Robert Pattinson）和尼克·乔纳斯（Nick Jonas）。

Outside of the army, where it originated, the buzz cut has long been the preserve of counterculture -- a symbol of rebellious aesthetics, empowerment, event political dissent.
Indeed, the late 60s look was anything but a buzz cut.
But to cut your hair short felt like conforming to old and staid social norms.
Hollywood helped fuel that image: from Sigourney Weaver in "Alien" to Demi Moore in "G.I Jane," the hair style became the quintessential tough woman trope.

（CNN）想象一下，晚上站在海滩上时，海浪突然变成了蓝色。
吉拉多说，胡安（Hutain）是自然和天气爱好者，也是他们甚至知道寻找罕见的蓝色波浪的原因。

(CNN) Imagine standing on a beach at night when suddenly the waves turn electric blue.
Girardeau said Hutain is a nature and weather enthusiasts and was the reason they even knew to look for the rare blue waves.
Some algae or animals that cause red tides, such as planktonic surface dwellers, use bioluminescence that can be triggered by a physical disturbance, such as waves, according to the SmithsonianHe knew the algae might cause the blue glow, but not all red tides create the phenomena.
"It was hard to tell from the shore," Hutain told CNN.
"It was really awesome," Girardeau told CNN.

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
后来空袭被认为是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

但是，美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）采访了包括帕特里夏（Patricia）在内的五名十几岁和二十多岁的女性，他们声称格拉瑟（Glaser）在Bery's Place对其进行了性和情感虐待。
当女孩们反对时，他们说格拉泽会威胁要把他们赶出去。
一些幸存者说，格拉瑟（Glaser）介绍自己是一名医生，但支持起诉的律师告诉美国有线电视新闻网（CNN），他是物理治疗师-不是合格的医生。
Dilen于去年2月在Bery's Place进行的一次警察突袭中因警察的讯问而被捕，后来被释放。
但至少现在，他们说他们开始在贝里故居之外享受生活。

But five women in their late teens and early twenties interviewed by CNN, including Patricia, allege that Glaser sexually and emotionally abused them at Bery's Place.
When the girls objected, they say Glaser would threaten to cast them out on the streets.
Some survivors say Glaser introduced himself as a doctor, but lawyers supporting the prosecution told CNN that he is a physiotherapist -- not a qualified physician.
Dilen was arrested for questioning by police last February during a police raid at Bery's Place, and later released.
But for now, at least, they say they're beginning to enjoy their lives outside of Bery's Place.

## 香港冠状病毒检疫营内的情况

### What it's like inside a Hong Kong coronavirus quarantine camp

假日营地变成了隔离营地-隔离饮食-温度检查和穿PPE的工作人员在隔离区生活-感觉就像在学校，营地和监狱中一样奇怪。
我的工厂位于鲤鱼门公园，通常是香港岛东部一个绿树成荫的度假村。
这个假日公园是香港用作冠状病毒检疫中心的几处设施之一。
在此之前，我已经在家工作了三个月-因此，在隔离营中做同样的事情并没有多大区别。
但这证明了香港政府对遏制从海外进口的案件并推回本地自满情绪的重视程度。

Holiday camp turned quarantine campLife in quarantine -- with its regimented meals, temperature checks and PPE-wearing staff -- feels like an odd mix of being in school, at camp, and in prison.
My facility, in Lei Yue Mun Park, is normally a leafy holiday village in the east of Hong Kong Island.
This holiday park is one of several facilities being used as coronavirus quarantine centers in Hong KongSince March, that number has surged.
Prior to now, I'd already been working from home for three months -- so doing the same from a quarantine camp hasn't made much of a difference.
But it's a testament to how serious the Hong Kong government is about clamping down on cases imported from overseas, and pushing back on local complacency.
