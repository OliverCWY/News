New York (CNN Business) Vox Media, owner of sites including Vox, The Verge and New York magazine, is furloughing about 9% of its employees for three months. The decision is one of several measures the digital media company announced Friday to cut costs after the coronavirus pandemic decimated its revenue sources.

The furloughs, which will run from May 1 to July 31, affect multiple departments including sales, events, production, IT, operations and editorial. Vox Media currently employs about 1,200 people, resulting in about 100 people facing three-month furloughs. In addition, about 1% of the company's personnel will have reduced hours for the same time period. Vox Media will continue to cover the health benefits of those affected.

Vox Media CEO Jim Bankoff announced the changes on Friday in a memo to staff that was obtained by CNN Business.

"Everyone will feel the effect of the cost measures to some degree, but some considerably more than others. It's our goal to treat those whose job status is impacted with the greatest possible care and support," Bankoff said.

Vox Media and New York Media —which the former acquired last year — are both unionized, which means management is required to negotiate with each bargaining committee on any changes in employment status. One of the protections management agreed to in negotiations includes no further furloughs, layoffs or pay cuts until July 31, according to two sources.
