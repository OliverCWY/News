英国政府疫苗工作组成员约翰·贝尔教授说，英国目前没有能力生产应对冠状病毒所需的疫苗数量，但“在疫苗开发方面确实是一个好地方”。
当被问及秋季是否可能生产疫苗时，贝尔先生说，真正的问题是这种疫苗是否有效，并补充说：“直到五月，我们才会收到信号。”
他说：“关键是必须进行适当的试验，因为安全对于这些事情确实很重要。”
“但是，如果我们能在五月中旬或五月底之前看到强有力的免疫反应的证据，那么我认为这场比赛已经开始。
“而且他们很可能会在八月中旬越过终点线。”

The UK doesn’t currently have the capacity to produce the amount of vaccine it needs to tackle coronavirus, but “is in a really good place” for vaccine development, according to Prof John Bell, a member of the UK government's vaccine task force.
Asked about the possibility of a vaccine being produced by the autumn, Mr Bell said the real question was whether it would be effective, adding that "we won’t get a signal for that until May".
"The crucial thing is you have to do a proper trial because safety is really important for these things," he said.
"But if we can see evidence of a strong immune response by the middle or the end of May, then I think the game is on.
"And they may well get across the finish line by mid-August."

他在周五的简报会上说，明尼苏达州，密歇根州和弗吉尼亚州实施的某些措施“太过严厉”。
此前，他在一系列推文中写道：“明尼苏达州自由党”，“密歇根州自由党”，然后是“弗吉尼亚州自由党”。
周五推文中提到的三个州的共和党总统全都领导着民主党州长。
但是，公共卫生专家和包括共和党州长在内的一些州长都强调了社会隔离的重要性。

At his Friday briefing, he said some measures imposed by Minnesota, Michigan and Virginia had been "too tough".
Earlier, he wrote in a series of tweets: "LIBERATE MINNESOTA", "LIBERATE MICHIGAN" and then "LIBERATE VIRGINIA".
The three states the Republican president referred to in Friday's tweets are all led Democratic governors.
However, public health experts, and some state governors, including Republican governors, have stressed the importance of social distancing.

德国卫生部长说，长达一个月的封锁使该国的冠状病毒爆发得到了控制。
感染率已降至0.7，也就是说，每个感染者将病毒传播给彼此的感染率都低于其他人。
但是，在德国，死亡人数和受感染卫生保健工作者的人数仍在增加。
到目前为止，德国已有近134,000人被感染。
到4月初，德国每天要进行超过100,000次拭子测试，因此与其他欧盟国家相比，可以追踪到更多冠状病毒携带者。

The infection rate has dropped to 0.7 - that is, each infected person passed the virus to fewer than one other.
However, the number of fatalities is still rising in Germany, as is the number of infected health care workers.
So far almost 134,000 people have been infected in Germany.
By early April Germany was doing more than 100,000 swab tests daily, enabling more coronavirus carriers to be traced than in other EU countries.

“过度旅游只是过度消费的另一种形式，”探险旅游贸易协会首席执行官兼可持续旅游倡导者Shannon Stowell说。
实现这一目标的一部分是选择可持续的住宿和活动，并选择绿色的交通方式来探索您所处的位置。
这可能意味着与更熟悉旅游业环境的可持续本地旅游运营商合作，这也是回馈当地经济的一种方式。
桂汉补充说：“我们仍然需要旅行。”

“Overtourism is just another form of overconsumption,” said Shannon Stowell, CEO of the Adventure Travel Trade Association and sustainable travel advocate.
Part of accomplishing this is to choose sustainable accommodation and activities, and a green mode of transportation to explore the place you’re in.
This might mean partnering with a sustainable local tour operator who is more familiar with the tourism landscape, which is also a way to give back to the local economy.
“We still need travel,” Guihan added.

希望冠状病毒抗体测试可以帮助英国结束封锁的希望受到了打击-在世界卫生组织质疑它们是否提供免疫保障之后。
英国已将抗体测试（该程序检查某人是否患有Covid-19）置于最终“重返工作”计划的中心，以重新开始正常生活。
约翰·牛顿教授说，在工作测试获得批准之前，公众不应购买未经批准的抗体测试。
仍然太多，我们不了解。抗体检测的第一个问题是没有大规模的检测方法，但是即使它们确实存在潜在的问题。
免疫护照将面临许多挑战-如果您通过抗体测试，您可以恢复正常生活-将是切实可行的。

Image copyright Getty ImagesHopes that coronavirus antibody tests could help the UK end its lockdown have been dealt a blow - after the World Health Organization questioned whether they offer any guarantee of immunity.
The UK has placed antibody tests - which check if someone has had Covid-19 - at the centre of an eventual "back-to-work" plan to restart normal life.
Professor John Newton said the public should not purchase unapproved antibody tests until a working test is approved.
Still too much we do not understandThe first problem with antibody tests is there aren't any that work at scale, but even if they did there are potential issues.
There will be many challenges before immunity passports - when if you pass the antibody test you can go back to life as normal - will be practical.

## 冠状病毒：唐纳德·特朗普能推迟总统选举吗？

### Coronavirus: Could Donald Trump delay the presidential election?

但是，选举日是什么样的，或者甚至将如期举行，这在很大程度上是辩论的主题。
这提出了紧迫的问题，即是否可以推迟11月的总统选举本身。
根据可追溯至1845年的法律，美国总统大选定于每四年的11月第一个星期一之后的星期二-2020年11月3日举行。
尽管不太可能彻底改变总统选举的日期，但这并不意味着该过程没有受到重大干扰的风险。
在正常情况下，接下来的几个月将标志着国家政治利益和活动的鼓掌，而选举活动日趋激烈。

But what could Election Day look like - or if it will even be held on schedule - is very much the subject of debate.
That presents the pressing question of whether the presidential election in November itself could be delayed.
Under a law dating back to 1845, the US presidential election is slated for the Tuesday after the first Monday of November every four years - 3 November in 2020.
While an outright change of the presidential election date is unlikely, that doesn't mean the process isn't at risk of significant disruption.
In normal times, the months ahead would mark a drumbeat of national political interest and activity that grows to an election day crescendo.

"I want to stress this may be actually a more optimistic picture than reality produces," Ms Georgieva told the BBC.
We don't want to lose accountability and transparency during this crisis," Ms Georgieva says.

在过去的二十年中，尽管专家经常质疑中国经济数据的准确性，但中国的年平均经济增长率约为9％。
它抹去了去年年底最新一组数据所记录的中国经济6％的增长。
但是，由于出口仍在中国经济中发挥着重要作用，因此全球其他地区的经济放缓带来了严重问题。
国际货币基金组织（IMF）周四预测，中国经济将避免衰退，但今年仅增长1.2％。

In the last two decades, China has seen average economic growth of around 9% a year, although experts have regularly questioned the accuracy of its economic data.
It wipes out the 6% expansion in China's economy recorded in the last set of figures at the end of last year.
But the slowdown in the rest of the global economy presents a significant problem as exports still play a major role in China's economy.
On Thursday the International Monetary Fund forecast China's economy would avoid a recession but grow by just 1.2% this year.

首先，中国的经济数据总是伴随着警告：不要相信您所读的内容。
但是，今年第一季度的经济数据总是糟糕透顶。
来自中国其他地区的需求正在显示来自世界其他地区的需求。
智库称，由于Covid-19对中国境外经济活动造成压力，外国需求本季度将下滑。
恢复的风险除了所有这些挑战之外，新的冠状病毒病例和再感染正威胁着中国经济的温和复苏。

First off, China's economic data always comes with the caveat: don't believe what you read.
But this year's first-quarter economic data was always going to be bad.
That demand from the rest of the world IS showing up in data from China.
Foreign demand will slump this quarter, the think tank says, as Covid-19 weighs on economic activity outside China.
Risk to recoveryOn top of all of those challenges, new coronavirus cases and re-infections are risking China's tepid economy recovery.

一家主要的商业贷款人表示，对贷款的潜在损失提供100％的担保将大大加快贷款审批流程。
前保守党总理乔治·奥斯本和现任影子商业秘书埃德·米利班德都表示支持这一举动。
CBILS方案不起作用。
英国在向陷入困境的公司提供贷款方面仍然远远落后于其他欧洲国家。
政府必须采取进一步措施，紧急改革该计划，以保证向小企业提供100％的贷款。”

One major business lender said that a 100% guarantee against potential losses on loans would considerably accelerate the loan approval process.
Former Conservative chancellor George Osborne and current shadow business secretary Ed Miliband have both voiced support for the move.
The CBILS scheme is not working.
The UK still lags far behind other European countries in getting loans to struggling firms.
The Government must go further and urgently reform the scheme to guarantee 100% loans to small businesses."
