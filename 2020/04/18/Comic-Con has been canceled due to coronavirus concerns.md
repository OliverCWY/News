(CNN) San Diego's Comic-Con has been canceled, the latest major cultural event to fall victim to concerns raised by Covid-19.

The convention -- which regularly draws more than 125,000 attendees, turning San Diego into the center of the pop-culture universe for four days each July -- posted the announcement on its website

"For the first time in its 50-year history," the organization behind the event said, they were announcing "with deep regret that there will be no Comic-Con in 2020."

The convention stated its plans to continue at the scheduled date in July 2021. Similarly, WonderCon Anaheim -- another gathering presented by the same group -- said its April convention would seek to resume in March of next year.

Although the event originated as a celebration of comic books, it has mushroomed into a showcase for all forms of popular culture, including movies and TV shows. Movie studios, in particular, have turned the event into a platform to promote upcoming films, which have also been postponed because of the public-health crisis.
