雅加达（布隆堡）-印度尼西亚已将更严格的社会隔离规则扩大到生活在爪哇主岛和西苏门答腊的数百万人，因为世界第四人口大国努力遏制冠状病毒病例的增加。
印度尼西亚内阁秘书处发表声明说，西爪哇省五个地区将实行大规模的社会限制措施，这些地区总共将容纳近900万人。
已经向中爪哇省的Tegal和西苏门答腊省发出了类似的命令。
政府已将部分封锁地区扩大到首都雅加达以外的更多城市，雅加达是疫情的中心。
西爪哇省的五个地区包括芝马希市，万隆摄政区，西万隆摄政区，苏美当摄政区和万国市-全国人口第四大城市。

JAKARTA (BLOOMBERG) - Indonesia has extended stricter social-distancing rules to millions of people living on the main island of Java, and in West Sumatra, as the world's fourth-most populous nation strives to stem a spike in coronavirus cases.
Large-scale social restrictions will be put in place across five regions in West Java that collectively house almost nine million people, Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto said in a statement issued by the Indonesian Cabinet secretariat.
A similar order has been given for Tegal, a city in Central Java, and for the province of West Sumatra.
The government has continuously expanded a partial lockdown to more cities outside the capital Jakarta, the epicentre of the outbreak.
The five regions in West Java include Cimahi City, Bandung Regency, West Bandung Regency, Sumedang Regency and Bandung City - the nation's fourth-most populous city.

首尔-当前外交官Thae Yong Ho成为有史以来首位直接被选举为韩国国会议员的北朝鲜叛逃者时，网民变得越发嘲笑，代表首尔江南富裕而时髦的地区。
“ Oppan Gangnam间谍”在一条Twitter消息中大叫，指的是韩国说唱歌手Psy演唱的热门歌曲Gangnam Style，描述了该地区的美好生活。
Oppan是韩语中“ brother is”的缩写。

SEOUL - Netizens went overdrive into mocking mode when former diplomat Thae Yong Ho became the first-ever North Korean defector to be directly voted into South Korea's Parliament, representing the wealthy and swanky district of Gangnam in Seoul to boot.
"Oppan Gangnam spy," screamed one Twitter message, referring to the mega hit song Gangnam Style by South Korean rapper Psy, which describes the high life in the district.
Oppan is short for "brother is" in Korean.

“这是一个新世界，”学校的班主任坦妮·林内特（Tanja Linnet）在学生于周四早些时候抵达时说。
对于Logumkloster地方学校的孩子来说，在家里呆了一个月后，他们的返回往往只是一次令人兴奋的经历。
2020年4月16日，在丹麦洛根克洛斯特休假后，孩子们检查他们的距离。
学生们唯一聚集的星期四是为80岁的丹麦女王玛格丽特二世演唱“生日快乐”。
2020年4月16日，一年级的老师Lena Thorup的学生坐在一个只有两个学生的书桌旁，在丹麦洛根克洛斯特。

"It is a new world," Tanja Linnet, the school's head teacher, said as pupils arrived early on Thursday.
For children at the Logumkloster District School, their return was often simply an exciting experience after a month cooped up at home.
Children check their distancing after a recess in Logumkloster, Denmark, on April 16, 2020.
The only time Thursday that the students gathered was to sing "Happy Birthday" to the Danish queen, Margrethe II, who turned 80.

莫伊拉·戴维斯女士（Moira Davis）的父亲斯坦利·平内尔（Stanley Pinnell）于4月8日在赫伦工厂去世，他对法新社说：“我肚子不舒服，我真的肚子不舒服。”
在大多数工作人员离开该设施后，卫生部门呼吁进行救援，发现居民脱水，几天没吃东西，躺在床上毫无生气，有些被粪便覆盖。
她说，赫伦公馆（Residence Herron）是“我们高级医疗保健中出了什么问题的贴子”-但她也确信这不是唯一的。
加拿大媒体还透露，该房屋的主人曾因贩毒，欺诈和逃税被定罪，这进一步加剧了公众的愤慨。
魁北克前卫生部长里安·赫伯特（Rejean Hebert）先生说：“我们长期以来一直忽略了老年人护理。”

"I was sick to my stomach, I was really sick to my stomach," Ms Moira Davis, whose father Stanley Pinnell died at the Herron facility on April 8, told AFP.
Called to the rescue after most of the staff deserted the facility, health authorities found residents dehydrated, unfed for days and lying listless in bed, some covered in excrement.
She says Residence Herron is a "poster child for what is wrong in our senior health care" - but she is also certain it is not unique.
Further fuelling public outrage, Canadian media also revealed that the home's owner had once been convicted of drug trafficking, fraud and tax evasion.
"We have neglected elderly care for a very long time," Mr Rejean Hebert, a former Quebec health minister.

东京（路透社）-日本对冠状病毒死亡人数上升和医疗系统崩溃的阴影感到震惊，它正努力通过自动驾驶设施和全科医生协助扩大检测范围，以协助收集样本。
牛津大学的数据显示，日本在三月份进行了约52,000个聚合酶链反应（PCR）测试，仅占韩国进行的测试的16％。
否则，医院就会崩溃。”东京杉并区普通医生协会副主任Konoshin Tamura博士说。
为了使PCR检测更加可用，卫生部周三向地方政府建议，直通检测可以增强其检测能力。
在卫生部的建议后的第二天，东京以东的千叶市就开始了通行测试，其他几家也在寻求效仿。

TOKYO (REUTERS) - Japan, alarmed by rising coronavirus deaths and the spectre of the collapse of the medical system, is scrambling to expand testing with drive-through facilities and general practitioners helping to collect samples.
Japan conducted about 52,000 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests in March, or just 16 per cent of the number carried out in South Korea, according to data from Oxford University.
Otherwise, hospitals would break down," said Dr Konoshin Tamura, deputy head of an association of general practitioners in Tokyo's Suginami ward.
In another bid to make PCR tests more available, the health ministry on Wednesday suggested to local governments that drive-through tests can bolster their capabilities.
A day after the health ministry's advice, the city of Chiba, east of Tokyo, launched drive-through testing, and several others are looking to follow suit.

他在电视简报中说：“该应用程序只是一个健康应用程序。”
新西兰在报告第一例死亡之前就采取了世界上最严厉的封锁措施，周六又发现了8例确诊的冠状病毒新病例，使所有感染病例达到1,094例。

Australia and neighbouring New Zealand have shown early success in potentially stopping Covid-19 after closing their borders early and imposing strict curbs on public movement.
Australia recorded 36 new cases on Saturday and a total of 6,533 cases, according to the health ministry data.
Government Services Minister Stuart Robert said there would there will be no surveillance involved with the app, which is to be ready within weeks.
"The app is simply a health app," he said in a televised briefing.
New Zealand, which adopted one the world's harshest lockdowns even before reporting a first death, saw eight new confirmed coronavirus cases on Saturday, bringing all infections to 1,094.

巴黎（法新社）-即使病毒学家对导致Covid-19的病毒零零落落，一个非常基本的问题仍未解决：从疾病中恢复过来的人是否具有免疫力？
专家说，即使许多人认为感染这种潜在的致命疾病至少在一段时间内会产生免疫力，对此问题尚无明确答案。
实际上，新的冠状病毒已经使人们感到惊讶，到此为止，病毒学家和流行病学家肯定很少。
另一项发布前的研究对上海的175名康复患者进行了研究，结果显示在症状发作后10到15天，保护抗体的浓度不同。
“这是我们真正需要更好地理解的东西-从免疫方面看，抗体反应是什么样的。”

PARIS (AFP) - Even as virologists zero in on the virus that causes Covid-19, a very basic question remains unanswered: Do those who recover from the disease have immunity?
There is no clear answer to this question, experts say, even if many have assumed that contracting the potentially deadly disease confers immunity, at least for a while.
In reality, the new coronavirus has thrown up one surprise after another, to the point where virologists and epidemiologists are sure of very little.
Another pre-publication study that looked at 175 recovered patients in Shanghai showed different concentrations of protective antibodies 10 to 15 days after the onset of symptoms.
"That's something we really need to better understand - what does that antibody response look like in terms of immunity."

克洛布查尔（Klobuchar）指出，如果冠状病毒仍然构成威胁，新罕布什尔州共和党州长克里斯·苏努努（Chris Sununu）于11月宣布在其州进行邮寄投票。
华盛顿的任何选举授权都在美国民主中引发争议，在美国民主中，各州选举程序错综复杂。
特朗普在4月7日的冠状病毒简报中说：“邮件投票对这个国家来说是非常危险的事情。”
“现在，邮寄选票-他们作弊。
民主党人说，经验表明，邮寄投票并未产生重大欺诈，共和党人可以像民主党人那样在选举中获胜。

Klobuchar noted that Republican Governor Chris Sununu of New Hampshire has announced mail-in voting in his state in November if coronavirus remains a threat.
Any election mandate from Washington sparks controversy in an American democracy in which a patchwork of state voting procedures are the hallmark of elections.
Trump during an April 7 coronavirus briefing said that "mail ballots are a very dangerous thing for this country."
"Now, mail ballots - they cheat.
Democrats have said experience shows that mail-in voting has not generated significant fraud and Republicans can fare as well as Democrats in such elections.

大孟买市政公司新任专员苏雷什·卡卡尼（Suresh Kakani）先生说，市政府正在确定将接受羟氯喹的目标人群。
卡卡尼说：“这是我们获得的一次性窗口，可以为世界正在努力的大流行提供答案。”
没有确凿的科学证据表明该药对病毒患者有效，更不用说将其用作预防性疗法了。
卡卡尼先生反驳说，选择这两个地点是因为它们是贫民窟定居点。
卡卡尼说：“如果相关专家允许和建议，我们可以尝试新事物。”

The city officials are identifying a target group which will receive hydroxychloroquine, according to Mr Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner at Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai.
"This is a one-time window available to us and may give answers for the pandemic the world is struggling with," Mr Kakani said.
There's no conclusive scientific evidence that the drug works on virus patients, not to mention its use as a preventive therapy.
Mr Kakani refutes that the two locations were chosen because they are slum settlements.
"We can try newer things if it's permissible and advisable by relevant experts," Mr Kakani said.

新加坡-卫生部（MOH）截至周五（4月17日）中午在新加坡已初步确认623例Covid-19感染，其中大部分是住在宿舍的外劳。
该部表示仍在研究这些新案件的细节，并表示将在周五晚些时候发布进一步的更新。
这使新加坡的冠状病毒病例总数达到5,050。
但是，早些时候有消息流传，新加坡在某些在线平台上的单日涨幅可能高达1146。
更正说明：该报告的早期版本称，新加坡目前有5,573例Covid-19病例。

SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed 623 cases of Covid-19 infection in Singapore as of noon on Friday (April 17), with the majority of the cases being foreign workers living in dormitories.
The ministry said it was still working through the details of these new cases and said it would issue further updates later on Friday night.
This brings Singapore's total number of coronavirus cases to 5,050.
However, there were messages circulating earlier that Singapore had presumably logged the biggest single-day spike of 1,146 on some online platforms.
Correction note: An earlier version of the report said Singapore now has 5,573 Covid-19 cases.
