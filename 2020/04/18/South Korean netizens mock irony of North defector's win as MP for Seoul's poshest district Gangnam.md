SEOUL - Netizens went overdrive into mocking mode when former diplomat Thae Yong Ho became the first-ever North Korean defector to be directly voted into South Korea's Parliament, representing the wealthy and swanky district of Gangnam in Seoul to boot.

"Oppan Gangnam spy," screamed one Twitter message, referring to the mega hit song Gangnam Style by South Korean rapper Psy, which describes the high life in the district. Oppan is short for "brother is" in Korean.
