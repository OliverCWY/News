(CNN) The Australian government will punish people convicted of illegally exporting masks, hand sanitizer or other personal protective equipment with hefty fines, under newly invoked biosecurity laws.

Home Minister Peter Dutton's office said in a statement Wednesday that the fines were one of several new emergency measures being adopted by the government to keep dwindling medical supplies inside the country as doctors attempt to contain the spread of the coronavirus.

To date, more than 5,000 people in Australia, including Dutton himself , have contracted the virus.

Under the new measures, authorities have amended customs regulations to "stop exploitative exports of essential goods," and to ensure that all surrendered medical supplies are redistributed to the national stockpile.

Violating the customs law is punishable by a fine of up to 210,000 Australian dollars ($128,275), while those found guilty of violating the Biosecurity Act could face up to five years in prison and a fine of up to 63,000 Australian dollars ($38,480), Dutton's office said.
