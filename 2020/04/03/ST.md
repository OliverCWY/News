路透社的数据显示，在过去八天内，案件数量翻了一番，达到一百万。
法新社说，封锁措施包括强制性或建议的禁闭，宵禁和隔离，已在90多个国家和地区实施。
泰国实行宵禁的规定将于周五生效，这将使面临封锁措施的人数超过全球78亿人口的一半。
目前有49个国家和地区的约27.8亿居民在家中受到强制性禁闭。
这些限制覆盖了3000万居民。

Cases doubled to one million within the past eight days, Reuters’ data showed.
The lockdown measures – which include compulsory or recommended confinement, curfews and quarantines – are in place in more than 90 countries and territories, said AFP.
The introduction of a curfew in Thailand, which takes effect on Friday, pushes the number facing lockdown measures past half of the global population of 7.8 billion.
Some 2.78 billion residents of 49 countries and territories are currently subject to obligatory confinement at home.
These restrictions cover over 30 million residents.

华盛顿（路透社）-美国总统唐纳德·特朗普说，他在星期四（4月2日）进行了第二次冠状病毒检测，使用了一种快速诊断方法，在不到15分钟的时间内得出了结果，并确定他没有被感染。
特朗普说：“我真的很好奇地想知道它能起作用多快。”特朗普上个月与一名巴西官员接触后也呈阴性反应，而巴西官员后来对冠状病毒呈阳性反应。
特朗普在每天的白宫新闻发布会上宣布了美国军方和联邦人员计划在纽约Javits中心会议中心开设临时医院的计划，以帮助该市应对大量患者。
纽约已经成为美国流行病的中心，该市已确诊的病例超过47,000。
特朗普先生说：“我们现在或即将开始建造超过10万台（通风机）。”

WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - US President Donald Trump said he underwent a second coronavirus test on Thursday (April 2), using a rapid diagnostic that produced a result in less than 15 minutes, and it determined that he has not been infected.
"I think I took it really out of curiosity to see how quickly it worked," said Mr Trump, who also tested negative last month after coming into contact with a Brazilian official who later tested positive for the coronavirus.
At his daily White House news briefing, Mr Trump announced plans for the US military and federal personnel to operate a makeshift hospital set up in the Javits Centre convention centre in New York to help the city grapple with a flood of patients.
New York has become the epicentre of the US epidemic with more than 47,000 confirmed cases in the city.
"We have over 100,000 (ventilators) being built right now or soon to be started," Mr Trump said.

根据新加坡对此类患者的最新研究，新加坡至少有10人从无症状者那里感染了冠状病毒。
该研究的重点是引起Covid-19的病毒Sars-CoV-2的症状前传播。
研究发现，在此期间的157例非进口病例中，有10例可归因于症状前传播。
在其中的7例中，症状发作前的传播是在源患者出现症状之前的1至3天发生的。
这项研究说，患者还可能错误地记住了他们的症状发生的日期。

SINGAPORE - At least 10 people in Singapore got the coronavirus from those without symptoms, according to a new study of such patients in the country.
The study focused on the pre-symptomatic transmission of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.
Of the 157 non-imported cases in this period, 10 could be attributed to pre-symptomatic transmission, the study found.
In seven of these cases, pre-symptomatic transmission exposure occurred one to three days before the source patient developed symptoms.
It was also possible that patients could have remembered wrongly the date their symptoms occurred, said the study.

长期以来，任何人暗示自第二次世界大战以来如此杰出和主导的美国领导层在竞争激烈的权力中心中逐渐衰落，任何人都可能会遇到同样的反应：不是很难！
医学领袖警告说，这种疾病可能杀死成千上万的美国人。
美国总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）的政府没有任何大胆的消息要就此事向其人民或全世界提供。
与此相比，中国在每次危机中在亚洲的形象都在上升。
衰落之星在这个宇宙中，美国之星正在衰落，亚洲也不能忽略它。

For long years anyone who suggested that America's leadership, so prominent and dominant since the end of World War II, was waning amid competing power centres, could have met with the same response: Not hardly\!
Medical leaders are warning that the disease could kill Americans in the hundreds of thousands.
The administration of US President Donald Trump has no bracing message to offer its people, or the world for that matter.
Compare this with China, whose image in Asia has risen with every crisis.
FADING STARIt is in this universe that the American star is fading and Asia cannot be oblivious to it.

巴黎（AFP）-这是彻底锁定的大门：血清学测试，它将明确显示谁感染了Covid-19，并且从理论上讲可以安全地重返工作岗位。
法国卫生部长奥利维尔·韦兰（Olivier Veran）说：“每个人都在等待整个世界的血清学检测。”
世界卫生组织说，血清学检查仍在进行中，但尚待适当评估。
普雷斯顿说：“在绝大多数的传染病中，从疾病中恢复以及强烈的免疫反应的证据将导致免疫期的再次发生。”
“（但）需要注意的是，我们不确定抗体阳性试验是否确实暗示某人免疫（来自Covid-19）。”

PARIS (AFP) - It's the key that opens to door from total lockdown: serologic testing, which will show definitively who has contracted Covid-19 and is in theory safe to return to work.
"Everyone's waiting for serologic testing, the whole world," said France's Health Minister Olivier Veran.
The World Health Organisation said that serologic tests were still being developed but were yet to be properly evaluated.
"In a vast majority of infectious diseases, recovery from disease and evidence of a strong immune response would lead to a period of immunity from re-occurrence," said Preston.
"(But) the caveat is that we don't know for sure that a positive antibody test does imply someone is immune (from Covid-19)."

The government has also ordered a slowdown in inbound travel, including Thais returning from abroad, and recommended that citizens postpone travel, in light of continued new infections from abroad.
“When the curfew and closure orders are lifted, new infections could re-emerge and continue like a loop.

悉尼-军用直升机将部署在澳大利亚的游轮上，以测试乘客的冠状病毒，因为十几艘游轮仍在海上漂泊或停靠在港口，估计载有15,000名乘客。
联邦政府已禁止游轮在澳大利亚对接。
“这些游轮知道冠状病毒活跃，知道总理和总理已经开始警告人们，他们离开港口，他们知道这种危险就启航了。”
像其他国家一样，澳大利亚现在正在努力解决如何处理游轮的问题，其中包括几艘被感染乘客抵达的游轮。
在整个太平洋地区，瓦努阿图和库克群岛等小岛国一直禁止游轮停靠。

SYDNEY - Military helicopters are set to be deployed to fly onto cruise ships in Australia to test passengers for the coronavirus as more than a dozen ships remained drifting off the coast or docked at ports, carrying an estimated 15,000 passengers.
The federal government has banned cruise ships from docking in Australia.
"These cruise ships left ports with people in them knowing that coronavirus was active, knowing that prime ministers and premiers had started to warn people - they set sail knowing this risk."
Australia, like other countries, is now grappling with the question of how to handle cruise ships, including several which arrived with infected passengers.
Across the Pacific, small island countries such as Vanuatu and the Cook Islands have been barring cruise ships from docking.

新德里（AFP）-最初由机器人科学家和神经外科医生创建的旨在帮助印度穷人的烤面包机大小的呼吸机为该国应对冠状病毒大流行提供了希望，并且需求旺盛。
随着印度的收费上升，全国范围内实行禁售措施，AgVa便携式呼吸机的产量已从每月500架猛增至20,000架。
AgVa呼吸机的价格约为2,000美元（3,139新元），是传统呼吸机（价格超过10,000美元）的一小部分。
印度最大的乘用车制造商马鲁蒂铃木（Maruti Suzuki）在政府呼吁所有汽车公司为抗冠状病毒工作做出贡献后，已承诺帮助AgVa提高产量。
印度医学协会秘书长Asokan表示，AgVa便携式呼吸机是填补健康空白所需的一种创新。

NEW DELHI (AFP) - Originally created by a robot scientist and a neurosurgeon to help India's poor, a toaster-sized ventilator is offering hope in the country's fight against the coronavirus pandemic and demand is booming.
With the toll rising in India, where a nationwide lockdown is in force, production of AgVa's portable ventilator has shot up from 500 a month to 20,000.
Priced at around US$2,000 (S$3,139), the AgVa ventilator is a fraction of the price of conventional ventilators, which go for more than US$10,000.
Maruti Suzuki, India's biggest passenger car maker, has pledged to help AgVa ramp up production after the government called on all auto firms to contribute to the anti-coronavirus effort.
Asokan, secretary general of the Indian Medical Association, said the AgVa portable ventilator was the kind of innovation needed to fill health gaps.

Relatively few healthcare workers have been affected in Singapore.
"Of course, healthcare workers can pass it to other healthcare workers, which then affects healthcare, but hospitals take enough precautions to prevent this," he said.
