（CNN）在这个国家，这是一个罕见的民族团结时刻，在过去的十年中，这个国家变得越来越脆弱，充满了种族和族裔紧张局势。
南非总统西里尔·拉马福萨（Cyril Ramaphosa）上周一宣布，为制止这种新型冠状病毒的传播而进行的为期21天的全国封锁将在周四午夜开始，这在当地引起广泛好评。
政府的措施意味着该国的边界现在已经关闭，除了运输燃料和必需品。
因此，拉马福萨（Ramaphosa）试图“拉平曲线”的努力，是南非在3月22日收录了约400例温和病例而没有死亡的举动，是一项大胆的先发举措。
据媒体报道，驻地指挥官告诉索马里社区组织的主席，这些指示直接来自小企业发展部长。

(CNN) It was a rare moment of national unity in a country that in the past decade has become increasingly fractious and fraught with racial and ethnic tensions.
To widespread local acclaim, South African president Cyril Ramaphosa last Monday announced that a 21-day national lockdown to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus would start at midnight that Thursday.
The government's measures mean that the country's borders are now closed except for transportation of fuel and essential goods.
So Ramaphosa's attempt to "flatten the curve," with South Africa on March 22 having registered a modest 400 or so cases without any deaths, was a bold, preemptive move.
The station commanders, according to media reports, told the chairperson of a Somali community organization that the instructions had come directly from the Small Business Development minister.

越来越少的人在外面闲逛。
全球遏制冠状病毒传播的遏制措施似乎使世界变得更加安静。
在世界各地，地震学家正在观察到的环境地震噪声要少得多，这意味着汽车，火车，公共汽车和人们日常生活中产生的振动。
而且在没有这种噪音的情况下，地球的上地壳运动的程度略微降低了。
他说，这个噪音水平与地震学家在圣诞节那天看到的水平相当。

And fewer and fewer people can be found milling about outside.
Global containment measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus have seemingly made the world much quieter.
Around the world, seismologists are observing a lot less ambient seismic noise -- meaning, the vibrations generated by cars, trains, buses and people going about their daily lives.
And in the absence of that noise, Earth's upper crust is moving just a little less.
That noise level is on par with what seismologists would see on Christmas Day, he said.

（CNN）澳大利亚政府将根据新近实施的生物安全法，对因非法出口口罩，洗手液或其他个人防护设备而被定罪的人处以高额罚款。
内政部长彼得·达顿（Peter Dutton）的办公室在周三的一份声明中说，罚款是政府为防止国内冠状病毒传播而不断减少的医疗用品，政府正在采取的几项新的紧急措施之一。
迄今为止，包括达顿本人在内的澳大利亚已有5,000多人感染了该病毒。
根据新措施，当局已修改了海关法规，以“停止对基本商品的剥削出口”，并确保将所有交出的医疗用品重新分配给国家储备。
违反海关法的行为将受到最高210,000澳元（128,275美元）的罚款，而被发现违反《生物安全法》的人将面临最高5年的监禁和63,000澳元（38,480美元）的罚款。办公室说。

(CNN) The Australian government will punish people convicted of illegally exporting masks, hand sanitizer or other personal protective equipment with hefty fines, under newly invoked biosecurity laws.
Home Minister Peter Dutton's office said in a statement Wednesday that the fines were one of several new emergency measures being adopted by the government to keep dwindling medical supplies inside the country as doctors attempt to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
To date, more than 5,000 people in Australia, including Dutton himself , have contracted the virus.
Under the new measures, authorities have amended customs regulations to "stop exploitative exports of essential goods," and to ensure that all surrendered medical supplies are redistributed to the national stockpile.
Violating the customs law is punishable by a fine of up to 210,000 Australian dollars ($128,275), while those found guilty of violating the Biosecurity Act could face up to five years in prison and a fine of up to 63,000 Australian dollars ($38,480), Dutton's office said.

莫迪告诉记者，克罗泽尔因表现出“极度糟糕的判断”和制造“大火”而被免职，因为他广泛散布了详细说明他所关注问题的备忘录，抄袭了20至30人。
有争议的信息包含在本周早些时候由克罗齐耶写给海军太平洋舰队的备忘录中。
克罗齐耶在备忘录中恳求海军领导人立即采取措施解决这一问题。
在接下来的几天里，我们预计将有2,700艘船下船。”莫迪在五角大楼对记者说。
它需要那艘船上的一定数量的人员来维持船上的安全和保障，”莫迪说。

Modly told reporters that Crozier was removed for showing "extremely poor judgment" and creating a "firestorm" by too widely disseminating the memo detailing his concerns, copying some 20 to 30 people.
The information in question was contained in a memo written by Crozier earlier this week to the Navy's Pacific Fleet.
In his memo, Crozier implored Navy leaders to take immediate steps to address the situation.
And in the next couple of days we expect to have 2,700 of them off the ship," Modly told reporters at the Pentagon.
It requires a certain amount of people on that ship to maintain the safety and security of the ship," Modly said.

随着整个欧洲的封锁措施越来越严格，慈善机构和警察部队对家庭暴力可能激增发出警报。
法国内政部长克里斯托弗·卡斯塔内尔（Christophe Castaner）表示，在采取封锁措施后，针对巴黎家庭暴力案件的警方干预增加了36％。

As lockdown measures across Europe get stricter, charities and police forces are raising the alarm over a potential spike in domestic violence .
Christophe Castaner, the French Interior Minister, said there had been a 36% increase in police intervention for cases of domestic violence in Paris after the lockdown measures were enacted.
The government has announced that it will pay for 20,000 nights in hotel rooms for victims of domestic violence and open pop-up counseling centers at supermarkets.
In Australia, the government said that Google has registered the most searches for domestic violence help in the past five years during the outbreak, with an increase of 75%.
Refuge, a leading British charity focused on fighting domestic violence, said one of the biggest concerns is that victims may find themselves unable to report their ordeal.

一些美国石油生产商敦促得克萨斯州的官员对该州的石油产量施加上限，此举与该行业的自由市场精神背道而驰。
沙特阿拉伯与俄罗斯之间的停火协议将有助于石油市场，分析人士估计，石油市场每天的供过于求量约为2500万桶。
问题1俄罗斯和沙特阿拉伯减产将缓解石油市场的巨大压力。
由于大多数美国人被迫在家工作，全球石油需求的波动因素之一正在急剧下降。
所有这些都意味着，即使沙特阿拉伯与俄罗斯之间停战，价格也可能承受压力。

Some US oil producers have urged officials in Texas to impose caps on the state's oil production -- a step that would run counter to the industry's free-market ethos.
A truce between Saudi Arabia and Russia would aid an oil market that analysts estimate is oversupplied by around 25 million barrels per day.
1 problemProduction cuts by Russia and Saudi Arabia would ease a great deal of pressure in the oil market.

Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

## 木摩天大楼革命终于到来了吗？

### Has the wooden skyscraper revolution finally arrived?

Mjøstårnet的高度达到280英尺，于去年开放后成为世界上最高的木材建筑。
长期倡导和设计木制建筑的建筑师Michael Green表示，“现在有很多东西在融合。”
Or Framework是位于俄勒冈州波特兰的一座雄心勃勃的148英尺高的木塔，在去年因成本担忧而被取消之前，该塔被设定为美国最高的木塔。
考虑到在2018年之前，俄勒冈州成为美国第一个允许使用18层木制建筑的州，而在美国，没有任何地方允许任何超过6层的建筑物，这一决定意义重大。
该组织表示，除了担心森林砍伐外，洒水喷头不能有效防止烈焰扩散到木结构建筑中。

Reaching 280 feet in height, Mjøstårnet became the world's tallest timber building upon opening last year.
According to architect Michael Green, a longstanding advocate for -- and designer of -- wooden buildings, there are "a whole bunch of things converging right now."
Or Framework, an ambitious 148-foot-tall timber tower in Portland, Oregon, that was set to be the USA's tallest wooden tower before was canceled amid cost concerns last year.
The decision is significant given that, before 2018, when Oregon became the first US state to allow 18-story wooden buildings, nowhere in America permitted anything higher than six.
In addition to concerns about deforestation, the group says sprinklers are ineffective at preventing blazes from spreading through wood buildings.
