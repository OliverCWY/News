尽管约翰·霍普金斯（Johns Hopkins）保留的理货记录记录了100万例确诊病例，但实际数量据认为要高得多。
西班牙确诊病例数从周三的102,136例上升至110,238例，增幅为8％，与前几天的记录相似。
到1月18日，确诊病例数已上升到60左右-但专家估计实际数字接近1,700。
3天后的3月26日，美国正式取代中国成为受冠状病毒爆发打击最严重的国家，确诊病例超过8.6万。
到4月2日，这一数字上升到217,000多，几乎是意大利案件数量的两倍。

Though the tally kept by Johns Hopkins records one million confirmed cases, the actual number is thought to be much higher.
The number of confirmed Spanish cases rose from 102,136 on Wednesday to 110,238 - an 8% rise that is similar to the rate recorded in previous days.
By 18 January the confirmed number of cases had risen to around 60 - but experts estimated the real figure was closer to 1,700.
Three days later, on 26 March, the US officially overtook China as the country hardest-hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with more than 86,000 confirmed cases.
By 2 April, this had risen to more than 217,000 - almost double the number of cases in Italy.

布雷特·克罗齐尔上尉在一封信中敦促其上级采取行动，防止美军在战时之外丧生。
莫迪周四告诉记者，克罗齐上尉因涉嫌向媒体泄露信而被解雇。
他说：“它使人们感到海军不在工作；政府不在工作。
克罗齐上校呼吁采取“果断行动”，称未受感染的水手必须从船上移开并隔离。
“未经彻底调查就将指挥官扔到船上并不能解决西奥多·罗斯福号上日益严重的危机。”

In a letter, Capt Brett Crozier had urged his superiors to act to prevent US troops dying outside of wartime.
On Thursday, Mr Modly told reporters that Capt Crozier was being fired for allegedly leaking the letter to the media.
"It creates the perception the Navy is not on the job; the government is not on the job.
Capt Crozier had called for "decisive action", saying uninfected sailors had to be removed from the ship and isolated.
"Throwing the commanding officer overboard without a thorough investigation is not going to solve the growing crisis aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt."

## 对冠状病毒的恐惧正在改变我们的心理

在我们的思维中，很少有疾病的威胁。
正如其他人已经报道的那样，持续不断的轰炸会导致焦虑加剧，并对我们的心理健康产生直接影响。
但是不断的威胁感可能会对我们的心理产生其他更阴险的影响。
由于对疾病的某些深刻发展的反应，对传染的恐惧使我们变得更加顺从和部落化，对偏心性的接受也有所减少。
行为免疫系统与人类心理学一样，对疾病的这些反应需要在史前史的背景下加以理解。

Rarely has the threat of disease occupied so much of our thinking.
As others have already reported, this constant bombardment can result in heightened anxiety, with immediate effects on our mental health.
But the constant feeling of threat may have other, more insidious, effects on our psychology.
Due to some deeply evolved responses to disease, fears of contagion lead us to become more conformist and tribalistic, and less accepting of eccentricity.
The behavioural immune systemLike much of human psychology, these responses to disease need to be understood in the context of prehistory.

图片版权EPA迹象表明，沙特阿拉伯和俄罗斯可能结束石油争端，周三油价上涨了20％以上，是有记录以来最大的单日涨幅。
美国总统唐纳德·特朗普说，他希望双方削减供应，而沙特阿拉伯则呼吁召开石油生产国紧急会议。
根据研究公司Rystad Energy的数据，本月全球原油需求预计将比一年前下降近23％。
“虽然停火协议（如果确实生效）将对（油价）有利，但我们认为，全球原油供应可能适度减少的好处仍可能被我们今天看到的原油需求下降所淹没“是由冠状病毒提供的。” CFRA Research的分析师Stewart Glickman说。
周三，油页岩生产商惠廷石油（Whiting Petroleum）申请破产，这是油价暴跌的第一笔股市交易伤亡。该公司曾经是美国北达科他州最大的石油生产商。

US President Donald Trump said he expected the two sides to cut supply, while Saudi Arabia called for an emergency meeting of oil producers.
Global demand for crude oil is predicted to be almost 23% lower this month than it was a year ago, according to research firm Rystad Energy.
"While a truce (if actually enacted) would be a positive [for oil prices], we believe the benefits from a likely modest reduction in global crude oil supply are still likely to be swamped by the decline in crude oil demand that we see today, courtesy of the coronavirus," said Stewart Glickman, analyst at CFRA Research.
On Wednesday, it saw the first stock market-traded casualty of the collapse in oil prices when shale producer Whiting Petroleum, which was once the largest oil producer in the US state of North Dakota, filed for bankruptcy.

对于世界上最大的经济体，失业率一直徘徊在3.5％左右，前景是完全相反的。
分析：纽约商业通讯员米歇尔•弗勒里（Michelle Fleury）报道，这是美国历史上新失业人数最多的一次。
在过去的两周中，大约有1000万美国人失业。
两周前有超过330万人提出索赔，超过了1982年创下的69.5万的记录，两周的总数达到了1000万。

Roughly 10 million Americans lost their jobs in just the last two weeks.

但是，英国官方的官方数字统计机构国家统计局（ONS）首次全面报道了迄今为止英国经济如何受到影响。
因此，下一组数字可能显示苦难程度大增。
竞争与市场管理局甚至成立了冠状病毒特别工作组，以制止价格欺诈。
其他物品的价格与某些物品的价格相差很小，例如抗菌湿巾和婴儿食品最近价格下跌。
但是，鉴于当今高度集成的全球供应链，这可能标志着某些进口商品的供应问题。

But for the first time the UK's official number-crunchers, the Office for National Statistics (ONS), has put out a comprehensive account of how the British economy has been affected so far.
So the next set of figures are likely to show a big rise in the level of suffering.
The Competition and Markets Authority even set up a coronavirus task force to deter price gouging.
Other items have seen prices vary by far less with some, such as antibacterial wipes and baby food seeing falls recently.
However, given today's highly integrated global supply chains, this could flag supply issues with some imported items down the line.

## 为什么呼吸慢可以帮助您放松

同样重要的是，心脏周围动脉中的压力敏感压力感受器会进入迷走神经。
在长时间的呼气过程中，通过反复刺激迷走神经，缓慢的呼吸可使神经系统朝着更加宁静的状态转变，从而导致积极的变化，例如心率降低和血压降低。
（要了解迷走神经及其在关节炎，糖尿病和心血管疾病等疾病中的作用的更多信息，请阅读Gaia Vince在Mosaic上发表的深入文章，或听她的广播纪录片。）
也许这些做法是通过无意识地意识到这种恢复性呼吸节奏及其将人们带入轻松但专注的精神状态的能力而发展起来的。
这可能是由于呼吸缓慢带来的心理舒适性以及对疼痛敏感性的任何直接生理变化。

Just as importantly, the pressure-sensitive baroreceptors, in the arteries around the heart, feed into the vagus nerve.
By repeatedly stimulating the vagus nerve during those long exhalations, slow breathing may shift the nervous system towards that more restful state, resulting in positive changes like a lower heart rate and lower blood pressure.
(To find out more about the vagus nerve and its role in conditions like arthritis, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, read Gaia Vince’s in-depth article at Mosaic, or listen to her radio documentary.)
Perhaps those practices evolved through an unconscious recognition of this restorative breathing rhythm and its capacity to send people into a relaxed but focused state of mind.
This may be due to the psychological comfort that comes from slow breathing, as much as any direct physiological changes to the pain sensitivity.

1941年9月8日，纳粹部队从西部和南部，并通过芬兰向北部包围了列宁格勒。
这是列宁格勒被围困的开始，这是历史上损失惨重的生命。
随着人口的饥饿，人们闻所未闻地谋求配给卡和吃尸体的情况并非鲜见。
尽管人们处于绝望的境地，但如果您知道在哪里寻找食物，仍然有一种食物来源没有被改变。
要了解这一点，我们需要问什么使食物变质。

On 8 September 1941, Nazi forces surrounded Leningrad from the west and south, and through Finland to the north.
This was the beginning of the Siege of Leningrad, the costliest in terms of lives lost in history.
As the population starved, it was not unheard of for people to murder for ration cards and eat corpses.
Despite people’s desperate condition, there was one source of food that remained untouched if you knew where to look.
To understand that, we need to ask what makes food go off.

旺加努伊河流经新西兰北岛的心脏，是新西兰最重要的自然资源之一。
毛利人是新西兰的波利尼西亚土著人民，为争取这条河的法律保护而斗争了160多年。
人们特别相信人与水是交织在一起的-传统的谚语是：“我是河，河是我”。
承认河流为法人意味着伤害河流与伤害部落相同。
旺加努伊河并不是在新西兰拥有法人资格的唯一自然资源实例。

Flowing through the heart of New Zealand’s North Island, the Whanganui River is one of the country’s most important natural resources.
The Maori, the indigenous Polynesian people of New Zealand, had been fighting for more than 160 years to get legal protection for the river.
Humans and water are especially believed to be intertwined – a traditional saying is, “I am the river, the river is me”.
Having the river recognised as a legal person means harming it is the same as harming the tribe.
The Whanganui River is not the only instance of a natural resource being granted legal personhood in New Zealand.

通过她的建筑建议，她试图在景观，空间，家具，身体和灵魂之间实现一种共生形式。
这样，艾琳·格雷的建筑就可以呼吸，并为居民提供了一个可以休息的空间，身体和灵魂都可以休息。 ，每个对象都被归入一个神秘而又活泼的统一体。
艾琳·格雷（Eileen Gray）的故事实际上就是取回的故事。

Eileen Gray was a fabulously glamorous figure, at the epicentre of the Parisian beau monde of the Roaring ’20s.
As Pitiot puts it: “Architecture for her is a form of journey, an accompaniment for the body and mind of its inhabitant.
Through her architectural proposals, she sought to achieve a form of symbiosis between the landscape, space, furniture, body, and soul.
In this way, Eileen Gray’s architecture breathes and offers the inhabitant an open space where both body and soul can rest.”Badovici himself wrote in 1924 in l’Architecture Vivante, that Gray’s designs revealed “an atmosphere of boundless plasticity, where different perspectives meld, where each object is subsumed into a mysterious, living unity.
And the story of Eileen Gray is really the story of retrieval.

这些发现强调了一种日益增长的认识，即与人类进化的过去相比，当今一种人类在世界上占主导地位的情况可能是不寻常的。
新作品还揭示了直立人的最早已知例子，直立人被认为是现代人类的直接祖先。
但是DNH 134表明，我们直系祖先之一直立人可能来自南部非洲，” Stephanie Baker说。
这一发现意味着此时非洲至少共存三种不同的人类物种。
但是现在看来，原始物种Hal naledi生存在南部非洲，H。heidelbergensis位于非洲中南部，我们物种的早期形态存在于摩洛哥和埃塞俄比亚等地区。”

The findings underline a growing understanding that the present-day situation, where one human species dominates the globe, may be unusual compared with the evolutionary past.
The new work also revealed the earliest known example of Homo erectus, a species thought to be a direct ancestor of modern humans (Homo sapiens).
But DNH 134 shows that Homo erectus, one of our direct ancestors, possibly comes from southern Africa instead," said Stephanie Baker.
The discovery implies that at least three different Homo species co-existed at this time in Africa.
But now it looks as if the primitive species Homo naledi survived in southern Africa, H. heidelbergensis was in south-central Africa, and early forms of our species existed in regions like Morocco and Ethiopia."
