The New York director dusted himself off, and quickly moved on. “I would not have been able to amass the body of work that I have by letting someone stop me. So, after Bamboozled, I went onto the next film and the next film.”

I wrote a biography on the filmmaker, Spike Lee: That’s My Story and I’m Sticking To It, and when discussing the project in late 2002, the curious director sounded me out by asking what my favourite one of his films was. My response was Bamboozled, which I felt had been maligned unfairly. The film saw Lee tackle racism head-on for the first time since Do The Right Thing, and deciphering several levels of prejudice in striking and unique ways. It could only have been made by a film insider, privy to all the shenanigans at work designed to keep the cream at the top. It brought a big smile to the director’s face. He wondered whether I’d seen the film on DVD, as a few people had been discovering the film that way. I’d actually seen it at the Ritzy in Brixton, travelling miles from my home to get to one of the few cinemas with the foresight to show the film.

Becoming a cult classic

Bamboozled came and went and even the DVD was eventually hard to come by. It was a forgotten movie. The world, according to the critics, had moved on. Proof of that came with the election of President Barack Obama, a sure sign that the US was on its way to becoming post-race. Then several tragic incidents changed that perspective and highlighted how, rather than being a historical document, Bamboozled was a story of our times.

George Zimmerman shot dead 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida in 2012; his claim that he was acting in self-defence was accepted by a jury. His acquittal inspired waves of protest and activism. It was the spark that created the Black Lives Matter movement in 2013, campaigning against systematic racism towards black people. In 2014, after Eric Garner and Michael Brown were killed by police officers in separate incidents, Black Lives Matter organised national protests and the social media handle \#BlackLivesMatter became part of the vernacular.

Following on from \#BlackLivesMatter came \#OscarsSoWhite, a social media campaign that forced the film industry to look at the composition of its gatekeepers, which accelerated in the aftermath of \#MeToo. Suddenly Bamboozled didn’t seem like it was a film looking back at the past, but a first step in highlighting the problems that needed to be addressed for the entertainment industry to change.
