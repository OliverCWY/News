在南非代表遇到一些技术困难之后，习近平主席在世界卫生大会初期就起床了。
他说：“一直以来，我们的行为都是公开，透明和负责任的。”
让我们看看他对Covid-19的回应还有什么要说的。

President Xi Jinping is up early at the World Health Assembly, after South Africa's representative experienced some technical difficulties.
"All along we have acted with openness, transparency and responsibility," he says.
Let's see what more he has to say about the response to Covid-19.

中国说，呼吁进行调查是在对抗冠状病毒，这分散了人们的注意力。全球卫生领导人将在联合国世界卫生大会上推动对对Covid-19大流行的反应进行独立审查。
周一的虚拟会议聚集了来自世界卫生组织（WHO）194个成员国的特使。
在疫情爆发期间为自己的行动辩护的中国国家主席习近平将在周一的开幕式上致辞。
自该病毒于12月在中国出现以来，已有450万人被感染，超过30万人死亡。
世卫组织女发言人玛格丽特·哈里斯博士说，世界卫生大会“一直是[世卫组织]进行大量审查的时候。”

More than 4.5 million people have been infected and more than 300,000 have died since the virus emerged in China in December.
WHO spokeswoman Dr Margaret Harris said that the World Health Assembly was "always the time for a lot of scrutiny [of the WHO]."

图片版权Plinofficial Instagram本周在宾夕法尼亚州的一家法院审理了一起针对29岁的俄罗斯说唱歌手Plinofficial的指控，他被指控犯有网络犯罪。
“嫁给现金，像风筝一样高”-这就是来自西伯利亚的说唱歌手Maksim Boiko在2015年制定信条的方式。
俄罗斯MTV歌迷投票选他第74佳俄罗斯说唱歌手，而且他很少在公共场合演出。
7月，Boiko在希腊发布了他期待已久的个人专辑，警察逮捕了俄罗斯公民Alexander Vinnik。
也许这笔钱不属于Boiko：联邦调查局（FBI）认为，俄罗斯是在从世界各地银行窃取的钱款合法化中使用的连锁中间人。

Image copyright Plinofficial InstagramA court in Pennsylvania this week took up the case against a 29-year-old Russian rapper, known as Plinofficial, accused of cybercrimes.
"Married to cash, high as a kite" - this is how Maksim Boiko, a rapper originally from Siberia, formulated his credo in 2015.
MTV Russia fans voted him 74th best Russian rapper and he rarely performed in public.
The July day when Boiko announced his long-awaited solo album, in Greece, the police arrested Russian citizen Alexander Vinnik.
Maybe the money didn't belong to Boiko: the FBI believes the Russian was an intermediary in chains used in the legalisation of money stolen from banks all around the world.

## S.J.贝克：改变公共卫生的女人

### S.J. Baker: The woman who transformed public health

马利斯对贝克的不信任并不是一个孤立的事件：对公共卫生的信任“在社区之间分布不均”，康尼斯说。
关于移民社区的陈规定型观念，包括贝克本人所认同的移民，进一步阻碍了人们对公共卫生的信任。
即使贝克于1923年从儿童卫生局退休，她的工作仍超出了卫生部门的范围。
她是一位多产的作家，发表了数百篇有关公共卫生的期刊和报纸文章，还为非专家出版了五本有关儿童健康与卫生的书。
然而，就目前而言，她应被誉为预防性公共卫生领域最早，最有影响力的十字军之一，并且在公共卫生方面不仅提供了可以采取的措施，而且还提供了不应当采取的措施。

Mallon’s distrust of Baker was not an isolated incident: trust in public health was “unevenly distributed among communities”, Conis says.
Stereotypes about immigrant communities – including those to which Baker herself subscribed – further hampered trust in public health.
Even though Baker retired from the Bureau of Child Hygiene in 1923, her work extended beyond the health department.
She was prolific writer, publishing hundreds of journal and newspaper articles on public health and five books on child health and hygiene for non-experts.
As it is, however, she deserves a reputation as one of the earliest and most influential crusaders for preventative public health – and provides an example of not only what to do, but what not to do, when it comes to public health.

杰罗姆·鲍威尔（Jerome Powell）在哥伦比亚广播公司的一次采访中补充说，经济下滑可能会持续到2021年下半年，直到找到疫苗，才有可能完全反弹。
但是，他表示有信心经济将复苏，并表示他绝不会下注美国经济。
鲍威尔本周早些时候曾呼吁美国议员通过更多的经济刺激和救济援助。
阿扎尔回答：“我不相信疾病预防控制中心会让这个国家失望。”
阿扎尔先生补充说，他对酒吧里没有进行社交疏远的人的形象感到担心。

Jerome Powell added in a CBS interview that the economic downturn might last until late 2021, and a full rebound may not be happen until a vaccine is found.
However, he expressed confidence the economy would recover, and said he would never bet against the US economy.
Earlier this week, Mr Powell had called on US lawmakers to pass more economic stimulus and relief aid.
"I don't believe the CDC let this country down," Mr Azar responded.
Mr Azar added that he was not concerned by images of people in bars not practicing social distancing.

圣保罗是该国受灾最严重的地区之一，迄今已有近3,000人死亡。
科瓦斯先生呼吁人们待在家里，他说圣保罗需要“进一步放慢脚步”以减少传染。
圣保罗拥有大约1200万人口，官方数据显示，大多数居民都忽略了社会疏远规则。
圣保罗不是唯一受到疫情严重打击的地区。
里约热内卢的死亡人数仅次于圣保罗，其医生也警告说，重症监护病房的床位短缺情况日益严重。

São Paulo is one of the country's worst-hit regions, with almost 3,000 deaths so far.
Mr Covas called on people to stay at home, saying São Paulo needed to "slow down even more" to reduce contagion.
São Paulo has a population of about 12 million, and official figures show most residents are ignoring social distancing rules.
São Paulo is not the only region to be badly hit by the outbreak.
Rio de Janeiro has the second-highest death toll after São Paulo and its doctors have also warned of increasing shortages of beds in intensive care units.

2020年前三个月，全球第三大经济体的年增长率下降了3.4％。
上周，随着更多主要经济体面临持续封锁的影响，德国陷入衰退。
路透社调查的分析师预计该国经济在4月至6月期间萎缩22％，这将是有史以来最大的跌幅。
短期来看，日本经济以及世界其他主要经济体的前景黯淡。
这是自1930年代大萧条以来全球最大的美国经济下滑幅度最大的时期。

The world's third biggest economy shrank at an annual pace of 3.4% in the first three months of 2020.
Last week, Germany slipped into recession as more major economies face the impact of sustained lockdowns.
Analysts polled by Reuters expect the country's economy to shrink 22% during the April-to-June period, which would be its biggest decline on record.
Things look bleak for the Japanese economy in the short term, along with other major economies around the world.
This was the sharpest decline for the US economy, the world's biggest, since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

瑞安航空表示，由于冠状病毒危机继续困扰航空旅行，预计本财政年度的乘客人数将减少一半。
该航空公司表示，预计这一数字将低于原来的1.54亿，低于8000万。
首席执行官迈克尔·奥利里（Michael O'Leary）表示，瑞安航空（Ryanair）仍计划在7月增加航班，并表示英国政府的检疫计划“白痴”。
瑞安航空宣布截至3月底的财政年度利润略高于10亿欧元（8.94亿英镑），因此预计会有更低的乘客人数。
随着重组以应对冠状病毒危机，瑞安航空将裁员3,000人，占其员工总数的15％。

Image copyright ReutersRyanair has said it expects passenger numbers to halve in the current financial year as the coronavirus crisis continues to blight air travel.
The airline said it expected numbers to fall below 80 million, down from its original target of 154 million.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair still planned to ramp up flights in July and said UK government quarantine plans were "idiotic".
The prediction of lower passenger numbers came as Ryanair announced profits of just over €1bn (£894m) for the financial year to the end of March.
Ryanair is set to cut 3,000 jobs - 15% of its workforce - as it restructures to cope with the coronavirus crisis.

图片说明1980年，位于Bridgend附近M4的新福特Escort福特在Bridgend的发动机工厂由于冠状病毒大流行而停产了近两个月，现在正在重新开始生产。
布里真德（当时部分是由于时任总理詹姆斯·卡拉汉（James Callaghan）的亲自干预）赢得了奖项，在威尔士南部已经有大约30家汽车零部件公司。
1978年福特的公告在南威尔士回声中被描述为汽车行业的“锦上添花”。
布里真德工厂开业几周之内，福特汽车宣布因汽车销量下滑而只会雇用1400名员工，而不是2500名员工。
福特·布里真德（Ford Bridgend）将在其成立40周年之际再次安静地重新开业，这注定是一个很短的时期。

Image caption The new Ford Escort on the M4 near Bridgend in 1980Ford's engine plant in Bridgend is restarting production after a nearly two-month shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.
There were already about 30 car component companies in south Wales when Bridgend - thanks partly to the personal intervention of then-Prime Minister James Callaghan - won the prize.
The Ford announcement in 1978 was described in the South Wales Echo as "the icing on an already substantial cake" for the automotive sector.
Within a few weeks of the Bridgend plant opening, Ford announced only 1,400, not 2,500 people, would be employed there because of a slump in car sales.
Ford Bridgend is re-opening quietly again on its 40th anniversary for what is destined to be a very short period.

但是在小镇坎皮奥·德·意大利（Campione d'Italia）里，事情并不像看起来那样天堂般。
该镇是意大利的一个前哨基地，完全被瑞士包围，自今年第一年以来就陷入外交调整。
该镇是一个地理稀有区，被称为飞地-一个完全被另一个领土包围的领土。
由于该镇没有人获得意大利的烟草销售许可证，因此吸烟者不得不进入瑞士购买一包香烟。
收益将支持该城市，他将其更名为Campione d’Italia（意大利Campione）以明确其所有权。

But in the tiny town of Campione d’Italia things aren’t as heavenly as they appear.
The town, an outpost of Italy entirely surrounded by Switzerland, has been caught in a diplomatic realignment since the first of the year.
The town is a geographic rarity known as an enclave – a territory completely surrounded by another territory.
Since no one in town has an Italian licence to sell tobacco, smokers have had to cross into Switzerland to buy a pack of cigarettes.
Proceeds would support the city, which he renamed Campione d’Italia (Campione of Italy) to make its ownership clear.

为了帮助您提供有关如何管理此功能的见解，BBC Worklife正在从存档中更新一些我们最受欢迎的生产力故事。
像许多作家一样，我是拖延症的最高专家。
顺理成章，有了更好的调度和更好的时间把握，我将不再拖延，继续我的工作。
诸如加拿大卡尔顿大学的蒂姆·皮基尔（Tim Pychyl）和英国谢菲尔德大学的合作者富希亚·西罗伊斯（Fuschia Sirois）之类的专家都提出，拖延是管理情绪的问题，而不是我们的时间。
我们要推迟的任务是使我们感到难过-也许这很无聊，太难了，或者我们担心失败-为了使自己现在感觉好些，我们开始做其他事情，例如观看视频。

To help provide insight on how to manage this, BBC Worklife is updating some of our most popular productivity stories from our archive.
Like many writers, I’m a supreme expert at procrastination.
With better scheduling and a better grip on time, so the logic goes, I will stop procrastinating and get on with my work.
Experts like Tim Pychyl at Carleton University in Canada and his collaborator Fuschia Sirois at the University of Sheffield in the UK have proposed that procrastination is an issue with managing our emotions, not our time.
The task we’re putting off is making us feel bad – perhaps it’s boring, too difficult or we’re worried about failing – and to make ourselves feel better in the moment, we start doing something else, like watching videos.

每15到20个达巴瓦拉斯，总是会有一个人待命，以防其中一个人拖延。
尽管时间紧迫，但在大多数情况下，dabbawalas在整理dabbas时显得异常轻松，开玩笑和聊天。
他说，达巴瓦拉按照他自己的标准来比较晚，但是客户可能从来没有意识到打the。
跟着他们走一整天是艰巨的工作。

The delivery schedule also has built-in buffers.
For every 15 to 20 dabbawalas there is also always someone on stand-by in case one of them gets delayed.
Despite the tight schedule, most of the time dabbawalas appear surprisingly relaxed, joking and chatting as they sort their dabbas.
The dabbawala was late by his own standards but the customer was probably never aware of the hiccup, he says.
Following them around for the day is tough work.

“我无法通过让某人阻止我来积累我的工作量。
这部电影是李自《正确的事情》以来首次直面种族主义，并以醒目的独特方式破译了若干偏见。
他想知道我是否看过DVD上的电影，因为有少数人以这种方式发现了这部电影。
成为一个受人欢迎的经典电影。
正是这种火花在2013年创立了“黑人生活问题”运动，反对针对黑人的系统种族主义。

“I would not have been able to amass the body of work that I have by letting someone stop me.
The film saw Lee tackle racism head-on for the first time since Do The Right Thing, and deciphering several levels of prejudice in striking and unique ways.
He wondered whether I’d seen the film on DVD, as a few people had been discovering the film that way.
Becoming a cult classicBamboozled came and went and even the DVD was eventually hard to come by.
It was the spark that created the Black Lives Matter movement in 2013, campaigning against systematic racism towards black people.

像在巴黎一样，美国拥有大量的停车位-仅在很大程度上位于地面上方。
据估计，美国有20亿个停车位。
此外，随着购物中心的关闭，“零售启示录”的威胁，数百万平方英尺空间的图片开始形成。
佩格斯说，地方建筑当局已经制定了处理集装箱运输的法规，这意味着重新利用集装箱农场的空间比建造新设施要容易。

Like in Paris, the US has an abundance of parking spaces – only they are largely above ground.
By some estimates there are two billion parking spaces in the US.
Add to that the threat of a “retail apocalypse” as malls shut down, and the picture of millions of square feet of space begins to build.
Peggs says that local building authorities already have codes for working with shipping containers, which means repurposing that space for container farms is easier than building new facilities.

图片版权娜塔莎·金（Natasha King）“我一直感到怀孕。
娜塔莎·金（Natasha King）并不是在谈论超重，而是指发现自己患有自身免疫性疾病，腹腔疾病。
乳糜泻是由对麸质的反应引起的疾病，主要影响小肠。
只有30％的人被诊断出患有这种疾病-英国腹腔疾病协会（Celiac UK）估计有将近50万人患有这种疾病，但并不知道。
我的皮肤泛着光亮，肚子都胀得发胀，感觉很恐怖，肚子看起来很苗条。”娜塔莎说。

Natasha King isn't talking about being overweight, she's referring to finding out she had autoimmune disorder, coeliac disease.
Coeliac disease is a condition caused by a reaction to gluten, and mostly affects the small intestine.
Only 30% of people with the condition have been diagnosed - and Coeliac UK estimates there are nearly half a million people who have it, but don't know.
My skin was glowing, my stomach looked so slim after being all bloated and feeling horrible," Natasha says.
