(CNN) After downing what he thought was about six glasses of wine, a tipsy looking Nick Kyrgios told good friend Andy Murray that he thought the former Wimbledon champion was better than Novak Djokovic.

It came as the pair chatted in an Instagram live session past midnight in Kyrgios' native Australia -- which was the middle of Saturday afternoon for Murray in the UK.

"Honestly I think you're better than Djokovic in my opinion," Kyrgios said. "Djokovic is playing dodge ball on my serve. He couldn't return it. And you are on it...slapping it for a winner. I couldn't get it past you."

Kyrgios does own a 2-0 record against Djokovic while losing five of six to the Scot. But Djokovic has won 17 grand slam titles to Murray's three to make him one of the Big Three in men's tennis alongside Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.

While Kyrgios and Murray have always gotten along -- even going on a roller coaster ride together in Cincinnati in 2018 -- the world No. 40 hasn't hid his disdain for Djokovic.
