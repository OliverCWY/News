香港（CNN）周一，立法会议上为争取关键委员会主席的控制权而在香港议会中发生了争执。
支持北京和支持民主的政客在众议院委员会上争论了数周，众议院委员会控制由半选举产生的机构讨论哪些法案。
国会议员将于5月27日对国歌法案进行二读。
拟议中的法律将其定为“侮辱国歌”，最高可判处三年徒刑。
反对派人士和人权组织对此进行了广泛批评，但它很可能会通过赞成亲北京议员占多数的机构。

Hong Kong (CNN) There were scuffles in Hong Kong's parliament Monday as lawmakers fought for control of a key committee chair.
Pro-Beijing and pro-democracy politicians have been arguing for weeks over the House Committee , which controls what bills are discussed by the semi-elected body.
Lawmakers are due to give the national anthem bill its second reading on May 27 .
The proposed law will make it a crime punishable by up to three years in prison "to insult the national anthem."
It has been widely criticized by opposition figures and human rights organizations, but is likely to pass the body, in which pro-Beijing lawmakers hold the majority.

吉尔吉斯说：“老实说，我认为你比德约科维奇更好。”
吉尔吉斯（Kyrgios）在对阵德约科维奇（Djokovic）时确实拥有2-0的战绩，同时输给苏格兰人六分之五。

(CNN) After downing what he thought was about six glasses of wine, a tipsy looking Nick Kyrgios told good friend Andy Murray that he thought the former Wimbledon champion was better than Novak Djokovic.
"Honestly I think you're better than Djokovic in my opinion," Kyrgios said.
Kyrgios does own a 2-0 record against Djokovic while losing five of six to the Scot.
While Kyrgios and Murray have always gotten along -- even going on a roller coaster ride together in Cincinnati in 2018 -- the world No.

但是，至少有三分之一的美国成年人每天至少吃一份红肉，远远超出了限制。
营养学博士学位的张说：“最佳健康饮食应该少吃红肉。”
但是，如果您正在考虑减少肉类的消耗，Cheung指出，请务必谨慎饮食。
尽管许多消费者想知道如果不吃肉就可以获取足够的蛋白质，但Cheung说，对于大多数美国人来说，这不是问题。
她说：“铁可能是一个问题，因为其他食物所含的铁不如红肉那么多。”她补充说，这种矿物质很容易被补品替代。

But at least a third of American adults eat at least one serving of red meat each day, far exceeding the limit.
"An optimally healthy diet should be low in red meat," said Cheung, who has a doctorate in nutrition.
But if you're considering reducing your meat consumption, Cheung noted that it's important to be careful about what you eat instead.
While many consumers wonder if they'd get adequate protein without eating meat, Cheung said that for most Americans, it shouldn't be a concern.
"Iron can be a problem because other foods don't contain as much iron as red meat," she said, adding that the mineral is easily replaced with supplements.

西班牙旅游部长雷耶斯·马罗托（Reyes Maroto）最近对当地报纸《埃尔·佩斯（El Pais）》说：“当国际旅游开放时，我们必须保证来西班牙的人是安全的人。”
这位官员说：“我们经济的很大一部分取决于国际游客和西班牙人的动向。”
西西里岛岛已经宣布了一项吸引游客回国的计划，并为国内和国际游客提供补贴假期。
他对桑塔格报纸报说：“一场欧洲人争先恐后地准许旅游者先行将带来不可接受的风险。”
尽管似乎令人怀疑的国际游客能否在2021年之前返回，但该目的地已经采取了减轻影响的措施。

"We have to guarantee, when international tourism opens, that the person who comes to Spain is a safe person," Spanish tourism minister Reyes Maroto recently told local newspaper El Pais.
"A big part of our economy depends on the movements of international visitors and of Spaniards," said the official.
The island of Sicily has already announced a scheme to entice travelers back , with subsidized holidays for both domestic and international visitors on offer.
"A European race to see who will allow tourism travel first will lead to unacceptable risks," he told Bild am Sonntag newspaper.
While it seems doubtful international visitors will be able to return before 2021, the destination has already put measures in place to alleviate the effects.

好消息是，这是挪威奥斯陆的蒙克博物馆（Munch Museum）可以采取的威胁保护措施。
这项研究周五在《科学进展》杂志上发表。绘画中使用的镉黄色颜料蒙克已经剥落并且变色多年。
在研究过程中，还使用了人工老化的镉黄制成的模型，以及Munch原来的镉黄油漆管中的样品。
研究人员希望继续与蒙克博物馆合作，并加强与其他博物馆的合作。
蒙克博物馆认为将其保存到子孙后代是当务之急。

And the good news is that this is a threat conservationists at the Munch Museum in Oslo, Norway, can manage.
The study published Friday in the journal Science AdvancesThe cadmium yellow pigments Munch used in the painting have been flaking and growing discolored for years.
During the research, mock-ups using artificially aged cadmium yellow, as well as samples from Munch's original cadmium yellow paint tubes, were also used.
The researchers hope to continue their collaboration with the Munch Museum and strike up collaborations with others.
Preserving it for generations to come is something the Munch Museum regards as imperative.

Still, Koekemoer hopes to expand into using non-recyclable plastic in the future, allowing the company to get even more waste plastic out of the environment.

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
这次空袭后来估计是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

但是，美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）采访了包括帕特里夏（Patricia）在内的五名十几岁左右的女性，他们声称格拉泽（Glaser）在Bery's Place对其进行了性和情感虐待。
当女孩们反对时，他们说格拉泽会威胁要把他们赶出去。
一些幸存者说，格拉瑟（Glaser）介绍自己是一名医生，但是支持检方的律师告诉CNN，他是物理治疗师-不是合格的医生。
Dilen去年2月在Bery's Place进行的一次警察突袭中被警察盘问而被捕，随后被释放。
但至少现在，他们说，他们开始在贝里故居之外享受生活。

But five women in their late teens and early twenties interviewed by CNN, including Patricia, allege that Glaser sexually and emotionally abused them at Bery's Place.
When the girls objected, they say Glaser would threaten to cast them out on the streets.
Some survivors say Glaser introduced himself as a doctor, but lawyers supporting the prosecution told CNN that he is a physiotherapist -- not a qualified physician.
Dilen was arrested for questioning by police last February during a police raid at Bery's Place, and later released.
But for now, at least, they say they're beginning to enjoy their lives outside of Bery's Place.
