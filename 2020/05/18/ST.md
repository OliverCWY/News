他补充说：“也是出于这个原因，我国政府决定将议会设在一天之内，我的演讲是唯一的议程。”
国王在讲话中还解释了他在2月马哈迪博士辞职后任命穆希丁先生担任总理的决定。
所有参加周一会议的议员，参议员，国会工作人员和媒体人员都必须接受Covid-19筛查。
国王，国会议员和议会工作人员戴着口罩，但君主撤下了他以发表讲话。
与党主席穆希丁一起创立执政党马来西亚大革命党的马哈迪尔博士就坐在反对派集团中。

“It is also for this reason that my government has decided to set the Parliament sitting for one day with my speech as the only agenda,” he added.
The King, in his address, also explained his decision to appoint Mr Muhyiddin as Prime Minister following Dr Mahathir’s shock resignation in February.
All MPs, senators, Parliament staff and media personnel attending Monday’s session were required to undergo Covid-19 screening.
The King, MPs and Parliament staff wore masks, but the monarch removed his to deliver his address.
Dr Mahathir, who founded ruling Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia along with party president Mr Muhyiddin, was seated in the opposition bloc.

吉隆坡-前马来西亚总检察长汤米•托马斯（Tommy Thomas）周一（5月18日）否认称自己同意“甜心交易”，以撤销与前总理纳吉布·拉扎克（Najb Razak）继任的1MDB丑闻有关的洗钱指控。
他说，艾德鲁斯先生的主张“预计马来西亚将从和解中收回约1.08亿美元”，这是“一条红鲱鱼”。
因此，对里扎来说，这是一笔甜心的交易，但对马来西亚来说，这是可怕的。”托马斯先生说。
拿督斯里·斯里·拉姆（Datuk Seri Sri Ram）拒绝评论他在和解中的作用，称爱德鲁斯（Idrus）先生在周日的声明“已结束”。
纳吉布先生和他的妻子罗斯玛·曼索尔（Rosmah Mansor）以及现任巫统主席扎希德·哈米迪（Zahid Hamidi）以及纳吉布先生领导该党时的其他主要人物都面临着PH执政期间提出的数百项贪污指控。

KUALA LUMPUR - Former Malaysian attorney-general (A-G) Tommy Thomas denied on Monday (May 18) claims that he agreed to a "sweetheart deal" to drop charges of money laundering connected to the 1MDB scandal levelled at former premier Najib Razak's stepson.
He said that Mr Idrus' assertion that "Malaysia is expected to recover approximately US$108 million" from the settlement "is a red herring".
Hence, it is a sweetheart deal for Riza but terrible for Malaysia,” Mr Thomas said.
Datuk Seri Sri Ram has refused to comment on his role in the settlement, saying Mr Idrus' Sunday statement is "the end of the matter".
Mr Najib and his wife Rosmah Mansor, as well as current Umno president Zahid Hamidi and other leading figures from when Mr Najib led the party, are facing hundreds of graft charges laid when PH was in power.

世界卫生组织首席科学家说，Covid-19冠状病毒不是在实验室合成的。
Soumya Swaminathan博士在接受《海峡时报》采访时说：“我们确实知道这是一种天然存在的病毒，不是在实验室中人工合成的。”
她补充说：“我认为科学家对此非常清楚，因为如果基因组是合成基因，基因组中就会存在一些标记物。
Soumya Swaminathan博士说，这种病毒不是在实验室中人工合成的。
会议通常会召集来自世界卫生组织194个会员国的日内瓦代表，讨论卫生问题。

WASHINGTON - The Covid-19 coronavirus was not synthesised in a laboratory, the World Health Organisation's chief scientist has said.
In an interview with The Straits Times, Dr Soumya Swaminathan, said: "What we do know is that this is a naturally occurring virus, that it was not artificially synthesised in the lab."
"I think that scientists have been quite clear about (that), because there are markers in the genome that would have given it away if it had been a synthesised gene," she added.
Dr Soumya Swaminathan said that the virus was not artificially synthesised in a lab.
The meeting usually brings together representatives from the WHO's 194 member states in Geneva to discuss health issues.

## 大流行后世界中的欧洲多重挑战

健康危机加剧了一些负面趋势，这些负面趋势在较长时期内一直困扰着非洲大陆，并将迫使欧洲各国政府面对他们多年来努力避免的挑战。
即便如此，已经很清楚，当计算之日到来时，将根据欧洲各国政府在健康危机期间的表现来对其进行判断。
再一次，这种指控可能是不公正的：医疗保健的主要责任属于各个成员国而不是欧盟。
没有德国的捐款，就不可能有其他债务购买，如果没有德国的捐款，一些欧盟国家可能面临国家破产。
即将演变为金融危机的健康危机可能同样致命。

The health crisis has accelerated several negative trends that have buffeted the continent over a longer period and will force European governments to confront the challenges they have spent many years trying to avoid.
Be that as it may, it is already clear that when the day of reckoning arrives, individual European governments will be judged according to how they performed during the health crisis.
Yet again, the charge may be unjust: Primary responsibility for healthcare belongs to individual member states rather than the EU.
Without German contributions, there are unlikely to be other purchases of debt and, without that, some EU states may face national bankruptcy.
A health crisis about to morph into a financial crisis could be just as virulent.

印尼极端分子正在冠状病毒爆发期间阻止袭击，留在家里，等待伊斯兰的预言中所预言的世界尽头-也许有机会死为烈士并进入天堂。
“必须指出的是，印度尼西亚的ISIS（支持者）从来不是一个有凝聚力的组织。”
IPAC说，一些ISIS支持者认为，这场大流行为罢工提供了“最佳机会”，而政府则全力控制这种疾病。
他补充说，在地区和国际范围内，反恐官员正在举行视频会议，以分享有关如何防止恐怖袭击的说明。
他说：“伊斯兰国的支持者说，受冠状病毒感染的西方人正在接受上帝的教训，而中国人也因对维吾尔族穆斯林所做的事情而受到上帝的惩罚。”

Indonesian extremists are holding back attacks during the coronavirus outbreak to stay at home and wait for the end of the world as foretold in Islamic prophecies - and, perhaps, score a chance to die as martyrs and enter paradise.
"It's important to note that ISIS (supporters) in Indonesia are never a cohesive organisation."
The IPAC said some ISIS supporters felt the pandemic presented the "best opportunity" to strike, with the government preoccupied in containing the disease.
Regionally and internationally, anti-terror officials are holding video conferences to share notes on how to prevent terror attacks, he added.
"The ISIS supporters say the Westerners (affected) by the coronavirus are being taught a lesson by God, and that the Chinese were also being punished by God for what they had done to Uighur Muslims," he said.

如此多的医生和护士感染了冠状病毒，以至于现在几乎没有医院在接受患者治疗。
但是根据医生和公共卫生专家的说法，实际上，这个大都市正在经历一场重大的，未经控制的暴发。
医生说他们在该市主要的公立医院Aminu Kano教学医院所见到的东西并没有什么神秘之处。
尼日利亚这个拥有约2亿人口的国家说，理论上每天可以进行2500次测试，而卡诺每天最多可以进行500次测试。
到4月下旬，卡诺州政府终于承认存在Covid-19问题，并向联邦政府寻求帮助。

And so many doctors and nurses have been infected with the coronavirus that few hospitals are now accepting patients.
But in reality, the metropolis is experiencing a major, unchecked outbreak, according to doctors and public health experts.
There was nothing mysterious about what doctors said they were seeing at Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, the city's main public hospital.
Nigeria, a country of about 200 million people, says it can in theory do 2,500 tests a day, and Kano up to 500.
By late April, the Kano state government finally admitted there was a Covid-19 problem and asked the federal government for help.

新加坡企业新加坡周一（5月18日）的数据显示，新加坡4月份的非石油国内出口（Nodx）上升，主要是由于药品从低基数跃升。
它不符合彭博社分析师调查中Nodx下降5％的共识预测。
新加坡企业（ESG）指出，去年4月药品出口额为9亿美元，低于2019年的平均水平14亿美元。
石化产品出口的增长也恶化，在三月份下降了22.5％之后，下降了24.9％。
在三月份下降0.2％之后，总贸易额同比下降了12.8％。

SINGAPORE - Singapore’s non-oil domestic exports (Nodx) rose in April, due mainly to a jump in pharmaceuticals from a low base, Enterprise Singapore data showed on Monday (May 18).
It defies a consensus forecast of a 5 per cent Nodx decline in a Bloomberg survey of analysts.
Enterprise Singapore (ESG) noted that pharmaceuticals exports were $0.9 billion in April last year, lower than the 2019 average of $1.4 billion.
Growth of petrochemicals exports also worsened, falling 24.9 per cent after a 22.5 per cent decline in March.
Total trade decreased 12.8 per cent year on year, following the 0.2 per cent decline in March.

华盛顿（法新社）-白宫在周日（5月17日）谴责了美国最高卫生机构，称“它让该国失望”，因为它提供了对应对冠状病毒爆发至关重要的检测。
白宫贸易顾问彼得·纳瓦罗（Peter Navarro）在接受NBC采访时说：“在这场危机的早期，CDC确实在这个领域拥有世界上最受信任的品牌，这的确使整个国家失望。”
但是纳瓦罗（Navarro）的言论标志着一位白宫官员对CDC在政府缓慢推出测试中的作用的最强烈批评。
“我不相信疾病预防控制中心会让这个国家失望。
“毫无疑问，疾病预防控制中心犯了错误，尤其是在大流行早期阶段的检测中……

WASHINGTON (AFP) - The White House rebuked the top US health agency on Sunday (May 17), saying "it let the country down" on providing testing crucial to the battle against the coronavirus outbreak.
"Early on in this crisis, the CDC, which really had the most trusted brand around the world in this space, really let the country down with the testing," White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told NBC's "Meet the Press."
But Navarro's comments mark the strongest criticism by a named White House official of the CDC's role in the administration's slow roll-out of testing.
"I don't believe the CDC let this country down.
“There is no doubt that the CDC has made mistakes, especially on testing in the early stages of the pandemic...

东京（法新社）-官员周一（5月18日）说，为了防止新的冠状病毒传播，日本备受喜爱的富士山将在今年的夏季攀登季节关闭。
静冈县官员告诉法新社，“这条路线在夏季开放，但今年我们将从7月10日至9月10日关闭它们，”这是富士山唯一的攀登季节。
这位官员说：“我们正在采取这一措施，以免传播冠状病毒。”
根据富士山的官方网站，去年共有约236,000名登山者前来。
也许由于这个原因，日本有句谚语说：“一次不爬富士山是愚蠢的。

TOKYO (AFP) - Japan's beloved Mount Fuji will be closed during this year's summer climbing season to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, officials said on Monday (May 18).
"The routes open in summer but this year we will keep them closed from July 10 to Sept 10," the only climbing season for Mount Fuji, a Shizuoka prefecture official told AFP.
"We're taking this measure so as not to spread the coronavirus," the official said.
It welcomed about 236,000 climbers last year, according to the Mount Fuji official website.
Perhaps for this reason, a Japanese proverb states: "It is foolish not to climb Mount Fuji once.

美国已经暂停了对世卫组织的资助，声称它对中国有偏见，甚至建议成立替代机构。
BOYCOTT威胁仍然存在，世界上某些地区对中国对大流行病的反应的愤怒仍是新鲜的，并且很可能在本周消除。
除了最初的掩盖之外，世界对中国对任何批评的严厉回应也变得越来越沮丧。
红线建设争端也使更多国家愿意向中国施加压力，在台湾，这是北京当局的红线。
“只要北京让国家在它们之间做出选择，台湾就会迷失方向。”

The US has suspended funding for the WHO, claiming it's biased towards China, and even suggested setting up an alternative body.
BOYCOTT THREATSStill, the anger in some parts of the world over China's response to the pandemic is still fresh, and will likely play out this week.
Apart from an initial cover up, the world has become increasingly upset with China's heavy-handed response to any criticism.
RED LINEThe building acrimony has also made more countries willing to pressure China on Taiwan, which is a red line for authorities in Beijing.
"As long as Beijing makes countries choose between them, Taiwan is going to lose."
