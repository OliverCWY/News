Like in Paris, the US has an abundance of parking spaces – only they are largely above ground. By some estimates there are two billion parking spaces in the US. Add to that the threat of a “retail apocalypse” as malls shut down, and the picture of millions of square feet of space begins to build. Peggs says that local building authorities already have codes for working with shipping containers, which means repurposing that space for container farms is easier than building new facilities.
