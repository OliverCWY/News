An online book of remembrance to commemorate those who have died from coronavirus in the UK has had more than 3,000 names entered since it launched a week ago.

The memorial book, called Remember Me, has been organised by St. Paul’s Cathedral in London with the support of the Prince of Wales.

The Dean of the Cathedral, the Very Reverend David Ison, said they had been “overwhelmed by the response” to the online book.

“It has been incredibly moving to see the messages from family, friends and carers," he said.

"It reminds us that every person who has died as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic is not merely a statistic in a health crisis - but a person, valued, missed and worthy of remembrance.”

Family members, friends and carers of anyone who has died can submit the name, photograph and a short message.

It’s open to people of all faiths, or none, and the deceased person must be British or have been living in the UK.

BBC Scotland has been telling the stories of some of those who lost their lives.
