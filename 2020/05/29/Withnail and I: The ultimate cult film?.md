The “hard-drinking” part of that scenario can’t be overstated. The film’s most celebrated line may be Withnail’s war cry in a Penrith tea shop: “We want the finest wines available to humanity\! We want them here and we want them now\!” And alcohol gushes so copiously through the story that a Withnail and I drinking game was inevitable. Foolhardy participants match the characters beverage for beverage as they watch, thus imbibing dangerous quantities of wine, beer, cider, sherry, Scotch and gin, plus – if they’re being purist about it – a swig of lighter fluid. One of the production’s ironies is that Grant is a teetotaller who is allergic to alcohol, and the only time he ever got drunk was under Robinson’s supervision as he prepared for the role. All the same, he went on to deliver one of the most accurate portrayals of a drunkard ever filmed.

As uproarious as the boozy scenes are, the characters eventually realise that they can’t drink their way through their problems forever. “We’ve all been that age,” says Kim Leggatt, the co-director of An Accidental Studio. “We’ve all had to grow up at some point and get real. But getting real comes with fear. That is, can we do it, can we succeed at life or are we going to fail? Are we going to get left behind and become a casualty? What then? That for me is what Withnail and I taps into.”

As McGann says, it’s a cunning screenplay. Nothing much happens in it, and there is no reason why Withnail and Marwood shouldn’t stay in touch, but when we see Marwood, with his flowing curls cut short, walking away from Withnail in the rain so that he can take the lead role in a play, we feel as if we’ve been on an epic adventure, and we’re now witnessing the death of a relationship and an era. “The pathos of the ending reinforces the peculiar poignancy of student friendships,” says Smith, “at once contingent and intimate, transient and unforgettable.”

Once you’re an adult, perhaps moored by a family, a job and a mortgage, Withnail And I reminds you just how poor, hungry, hungover, and disgustingly unhygienic you were in your younger days. But it also reminds you how precious and brief those days were. It’s no wonder that when the film finishes, you have the urge to rewind the video, or to click on the streaming link, and drift into the arena of the unwell yet again.
