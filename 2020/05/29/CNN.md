香港（CNN）在北京有一个崭新的外交品牌，其首席建筑师有一个凶猛的绰号来匹配他们的进取风格-他们是狼战士。
这个词现在已经在中国的国有媒体和西方出版物中广泛使用，并且在上周末明确表明其支持者得到了中国最高外交官的全力支持。
外交部长王毅周日在北京举行的新闻发布会上说，中国现在将反击“蓄意侮辱”。
我们将抵制任何蓄意的侮辱，坚决捍卫我们的国家荣誉和尊严，我们将以事实驳斥一切毫无根据的诽谤。”王先生回答CNN的问题。
但是什么是“狼战士”外交，这个名字是什么意思，它的起源是什么？

Hong Kong (CNN) There is a new brand of diplomacy taking hold in Beijing and its chief architects have a suitably fierce nickname to match their aggressive style -- they are the wolf warriors.
It's a phrase that is now used widely in Chinese state-run media as well as Western publications, and it was made clear last weekend that its proponents have the full support of the country's top diplomat.
Speaking at a press conference in Beijing Sunday, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that China would now push back against "deliberate insults."
We will push back against any deliberate insult, resolutely defend our national honor and dignity, and we will refute all groundless slander with facts," said Wang, responding to a question from CNN.
But what is "wolf warrior" diplomacy, what does the name mean and where did it originate?

香港（CNN）有时，最好的时机不是在您最强的时候，而是在竞争对手最弱的时候。
对国家安全的关注在最近几天，没有比在香港更能从根本上改变现状。
中国专家杰罗姆·科恩（Jerome Cohen）上周写道：“尽管北京举行的Covid-19抗议活动暂停了，但从北京的角度来看，香港的局势正在稳步恶化。”
“如果任其溃烂而没有任何制止之嫌，那么秋季的前景将使香港进一步摆脱中国的控制。”
台湾质疑华盛顿，乃至整个国际社会干预香港的能力是极为有限的。

Hong Kong (CNN) Sometimes, the best time to act isn't when you're at your strongest, but when your rivals are weakest.
National security concernsNowhere has the status quo been shifted more radically in recent days than in Hong Kong.
"The situation in Hong Kong, from Beijing's viewpoint, was steadily getting worse, despite the pause in protests occasioned by Covid-19," wrote China expert Jerome Cohen this week .
"If allowed to fester without any attempt to suppress it, prospects for the autumn promised to see Hong Kong move further out of PRC control."
Taiwan questionWashington's ability, indeed that of the entire international community, to intervene in Hong Kong is extremely limited.

## 拉丁美洲政府对Covid-19的反应

### How Latin American governments reacted to Covid-19

与之形成鲜明对比的是，拉丁美洲的其他国家元首也采取了重大措施来减缓Covid-19的传播。
世界卫生组织上周表示，南美已成为新的Covid-19震中。
例如，拉维多利亚（La Victoria）的加玛拉（Gamarra）市场是拉丁美洲最大的纺织中心，而且大多数工人都是临时工。
根据战略与国际研究中心最近的一份报告，拉丁美洲拥有世界上20个经济最不平等国家中的8个。
但是，以每10万人的0.20例死亡计算，中美洲五百万人口国家的Covid-19死亡率是拉丁美洲最低的国家之一。

In stark contrast, other heads of state in Latin America have implemented dramatic measures to slow the spread of Covid-19.
Last week the World Health Organization said South America had become the new Covid-19 epicenter.
The Gamarra market in La Victoria, for example, is the largest textile center in Latin America and most workers there are day laborers.
According to a recent report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Latin America holds eight of the world's 20 most economically unequal countries.
However, at 0.20 deaths per 100,000 people, the Central American nation of five million has one of the lowest Covid-19 mortality rates in Latin America.

## 波兰的“幽灵选举”能教给我们有关大流行时代民主的知识

### What Poland's 'ghost election' can teach us about pandemic-era democracy

这些动态正在波兰进行，波兰原定于本月初举行总统大选。
当任何一方都不信任另一方以公民的最大利益行事时，就会影响人们对民主的看法。
“这是一个非常严重的问题，因为这是民主制度运转的最重要要素之一。”
“只有总统才能在全国范围内竞选……所有其他候选人都仅限于媒体和在线存在。”
波兰观察家希望自己的国家从“鬼魂”选举的惨败中吸取教训，并希望该国能比本月初举行的选举更快，更公正地举行选举。

These dynamics are playing out in Poland, which was scheduled to hold its presidential election earlier this month.
When neither side trusts the other to act in the best interest of citizens, it affects the way people view their democracy.
"That's a very serious concern, because that's one of the most important elements of a functioning democracy."
"Only the president will be able to campaign across the country ... all other candidates are limited to media and online presence."
Polish observers hope their country has learned from its "ghost" election fiasco — and that the country can soon hold an election that is better run and fairer than the one that didn't happen earlier this month.

## 德国自1930年代以来首次重新引入军事拉比

### Germany to reintroduce military rabbis for the first time since 1930s

（CNN）自从纳粹在1930年代禁止拉比加入军队以来，德国首次将拉比引入军队。
德国议会在周四重新确立了军事拉比的官方地位，对此法律施加了橡皮图章，这是自1957年以来第一次对军事牧民护理法进行扩展。
军事拉比是第一次世界大战期间德国武装部队的一部分，当时约有100,000名犹太士兵为该国作战。
1933年阿道夫·希特勒（Adolf Hitler）执政后不久，纳粹就采取了禁令，这是纳粹早期将犹太人从公共生活中驱逐出局的一部分。
德国军方最近承认自己的内部存在极端主义问题。

(CNN) Germany is reintroducing rabbis into its military for the first time since the Nazis banned them from the armed forces in the 1930s.
The German Parliament rubber-stamped the law reestablishing the official position of military rabbi on Thursday in what was the first expansion of the law on military pastoral care since 1957.
Military rabbis were part of the German armed forces during World War I, when around 100,000 Jewish soldiers fought for the country.
They were banned shortly after Adolf Hitler assumed power in 1933, as part of the Nazi's early efforts to remove Jews from the public life.
The German military has admitted recently it has a problem with extremism within its ranks .

首尔（CNN）周五，短暂开放后，超过500所学校再次对学生关闭。韩国方面正采取行动，遏制在首都首尔及其周边大都市地区再次流行的冠状病毒。
卫生部长Park Neung-hoo周四表示，大都会地区政府主办的活动也将被取消或推迟。
朴槿惠还要求居住在首尔市区的人们不要出门或在下个两周举行活动。
冠状病毒的爆发包括富川市一个物流中心的一个集群。
卫生部副部长金刚利在简报中说，截至周五，已经有近100例病例与物流中心群有关。

Seoul (CNN) More than 500 schools closed again Friday to students after briefly reopening, as South Korea moves to stamp out a resurgence of the coronavirus in the capital, Seoul, and its surrounding metropolitan area.
Government hosted events in the metropolitan area will be canceled or postponed as well, Health Minister Park Neung-hoo said Thursday.
Park also asked people living in the Seoul metropolitan area to refrain from going outside or holding events for the next fortnight.
The coronavirus outbreak includes a cluster in a logistics center in Bucheon.
Almost 100 cases had been linked to the logistics center cluster as of Friday, Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said in a briefing.

南非布隆方丹（CNN业务）一个应用程序将气象站数据与非洲农民的传统知识相结合，以预测干旱。
为了帮助农民为气候变化的影响做准备，肯尼亚计算机科学家Muthoni Masinde创建了移动平台ITIKI。
该名称代表信息技术和土著知识，该平台通过应用程序或SMS消息向农民发送干旱预报。
Masinde说，尽管它使用气象数据，但大多数非洲农民可以更好地与传统知识相关联，这些传统知识也用于制定平台的预测。
他们在ITIKI应用程序上捕获了他们的发现，然后ITIKI将这些信息与本地气象站的数据进行核对，以提前几个月模拟天气模式。

Bloemfontein, South Africa (CNN Business) An app is combining weather station data with the traditional knowledge of African farmers to predict droughts.
To help prepare farmers for the effects of climate change, Kenyan computer scientist Muthoni Masinde has created mobile platform ITIKI.

Although it uses meteorological data, Masinde says most African farmers can better relate to the traditional knowledge that is also used to formulate the platform's predictions.
They capture their findings on the ITIKI app, and ITIKI collates this information with data from local weather stations to model weather patterns months in advance.

（CNN）当一位女士告诉野生动物保护官员时，她以为自己在华盛顿州长滩半岛的海滩上看到了一只金刚狼，他们不相信她。
华盛顿鱼类和野生动植物部（WDFW）称，这种难以捉摸的生物生活在偏远的山区，任何目击事件（更不用说在海滩上）了都是罕见的。
WDFW的中叶食肉动物保护生物学家杰夫·刘易斯（Jeff Lewis）向CNN讲述了这次遭遇，并证实该动物确实是金刚狼。
根据WDFW的说法，整个状态下大约只有20种哺乳动物。
它们通常在北喀斯喀特的偏远山区漫游，而不是在沙滩上漫游。

(CNN) When a woman told a wildlife official she thought she'd seen a wolverine on the beach of Washington state's Long Beach Peninsula they didn't believe her.
The elusive creatures live in remote mountainous areas and any sightings -- let alone on a beach -- are rare, according to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW).
Jeff Lewis, a mesocarnivore conservation biologist with the WDFW, told CNN about the encounter and that he confirmed the animal was indeed a wolverine.
There are only around 20 of the mammals in the entire state, according to WDFW .
They are usually roaming in the remote mountainous areas of the North Cascades not on the sandy beach.

That ad was produced by the Las Vegas Convention & Visitors Authority (LVCVA), the organization charged with marketing Southern Nevada and the same group that put together the famous "What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas" campaign.
Ethan Miller/Getty ImagesWithout question, the most important aspect of reopening Las Vegas is reopening the hotels — people who are visiting from outside the city obviously need places to stay.
On the Las Vegas Strip, the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard that runs from the "Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas" sign to Sahara Avenue, casinos to open June 4 will include New York-New York Hotel & Casino, The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Bellagio, Caesars Palace, the Flamingo Las Vegas, the Venetian and Wynn Las Vegas.

在Pew研究中心最近的一项评估科学知识的研究中，受过研究生教育的美国人（如硕士或博士学位）表现最好。
国家科学教育中心执行主任安·里德（Ann Reid）说：“美国的公立学校系统完全是分散的。”
“孩子们接受的科学教育可能在一个地方到另一个地方差异很大。”
实际上，某些民意调查显示美国人对科学的理解存在差距，这表明他们渴望学习更多。
如果您是想了解更多信息的美国人之一，那么有很多免费的资源可以重提您对科学的理解。

Americans with a post-graduate education — think master's or doctorate — did the best on a recent Pew Research Center study evaluating science knowledge.
"The public school system in the US is completely decentralized," said Ann Reid, the executive director of the National Center for Science Education .
"The science education that kids get can vary enormously from one place to another."
In fact, some of the same polls that revealed gaps in Americans' understanding of science spoke to their desire to learn more.
If you're one of the Americans who wants to learn more, there are plenty of free resources for brushing up on your understanding of science.

总理安格拉·默克尔（Angela Merkel）立即宣布，她将把该国7个最古老的核电厂从电网中撤出。

路德维希（Ludewig）的项目还把他带到了当今乌克兰废弃的切尔诺贝利核电站。
统一后，该国东部由苏联设计的设施（如格赖夫斯瓦尔德核电站）已退役。
“如果您发布数百张有关核能的图片来显示其隐藏的美，而您没有表现出这场灾难，那将是不诚实的。”

Chancellor Angela Merkel immediately announced that she was taking the country's seven oldest nuclear power plants off the grid.

Ludewig's project also took him to the abandoned Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in present-day Ukraine.
Soviet-designed facilities in the country's east, such as the Greifswald Nuclear Power Plant, were decommissioned after the country's reunification.
"If you publish hundreds of pictures about nuclear power that show its hidden beauty, and you don't show the catastrophe, then it wouldn't be honest."
