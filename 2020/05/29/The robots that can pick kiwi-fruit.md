On top of this platform we are working on a number of solutions that can be clipped on top, much like a farmer’s tractor. One of these is our kiwi-fruit harvester, which was initially developed by my co-founder Alistair Scarfe during his PhD at Massey University, in Palmerston North, New Zealand. He has proven that it is possible to use a robot to identify fruit, reach up, pull it off the plant and collect it on a hopper. Mounting this on a mobile platform means it can harvest fruit, sort them into bins by size and deliver them to the pack house before driving back out to carry on picking.
