世界卫生组织（WHO）顾问称赞他们为加强医院能力，进行联系追踪和隔离患者所做的努力，他说，韩国，越南和新加坡等亚洲国家在对抗Covid-19方面表现良好。
“最好的例子是新加坡，香港，台湾和韩国以及越南的情况。
伦敦卫生与热带医学学院传染病流行病学专家海曼教授表示，分阶段开放经济是有意义的。
Heymann教授提到的其他亚洲经济体报告的感染数量要低得多。
当被问及冠状病毒是否可以在游泳池中生存时，海曼教授说，到目前为止，还没有爆发与游泳池有关的疾病。

SINGAPORE - Asian countries such as South Korea, Vietnam and Singapore are doing well in their fight against Covid-19, said a World Health Organisation (WHO) adviser as he praised their efforts to build hospital capacity, perform contact tracing and isolate patients.
"The best examples are what's going on in Singapore, in Hong Kong, in Taiwan and South Korea and in Vietnam.
Prof Heymann, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said it makes sense to open up the economy in stages.
The other Asian economies mentioned by Prof Heymann have reported a far lower number of infections.
Asked if the coronavirus could survive in swimming pools, Prof Heymann said there have been no outbreaks associated with swimming pools so far.

新加坡-中国和新加坡将在下个月初启动“快速通道”安排，以便利两国之间因商务和公务旅行而进行的必要旅行，因为它们已从冠状病毒大流行中采取了适当的控制措施。
《海峡时报》了解到，这是新加坡与另一个国家之间的第一个绿道安排。
两国不久将举行第十六届双边合作联合理事会会议，这是两国之间的最高双边平台，包括公共卫生问题。
在周四的虚拟新闻发布会上，国家发展部长劳伦斯·王说，新加坡正在考虑允许基本旅行恢复。
该国正在努力重新开放边界-与控制病毒情况的国家建立“旅行泡沫”，并与某些国家进行绿道旅行安排。

SINGAPORE - Singapore and China will launch a "fast lane" arrangement early next month to facilitate essential travel for business and official purposes between the two countries, as they emerge from the coronavirus pandemic with control measures in place.
The Straits Times understands that this is the first green lane arrangement between Singapore and another country.
The two countries will soon hold the 16th Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation Meeting, which is the apex bilateral platform between both countries, including on public health issues.
During a virtual press conference on Thursday, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said Singapore is considering allowing essential travel to resume.
The country is working on reopening its borders - establishing "travel bubbles" with countries where the virus situation is under control and having green lane travel arrangements with certain countries.

马来西亚-马来西亚已要求在5月31日的最后期限之前决定进一步中止拟建的吉隆坡-新加坡高铁（HSR）线路，以决定是否继续进行该项目。
但是，通过谈判达成了一项暂停该项目的协议，因为取消该协议将需要根据两国之间签署的高铁协议获得高额赔偿。
马来西亚已向新加坡支付了1500万美元，以弥补共和国因该项目中止而产生的堕胎费用。
他补充说，更长的停工期也将影响到裕廊湖区的开发计划，该区将容纳新加坡高铁总站以及许多交通，商业，住宅和娱乐项目。
如果高铁项目终止，马来西亚将不得不偿还新加坡在中止之前发生的项目实施费用。

SINGAPORE - Malaysia has asked for a further suspension of the proposed Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High-Speed Rail (HSR) line, ahead of a May 31 deadline to decide whether to proceed with the project.
However, a deal was negotiated to suspend the project instead as a cancellation would have entailed a high amount of compensation under the HSR agreement signed between the two countries.
Malaysia had paid Singapore $15 million for the abortive costs the Republic incurred as a result of the project being suspended.
A longer suspension period would also impact development plans for the Jurong Lake District, which will host the Singapore HSR Terminus and many transport, commercial, residential and recreational developments, he added.
Should the HSR project be terminated, Malaysia would have to reimburse the project implementation costs incurred by Singapore up to the point of suspension.

特朗普在白宫玫瑰园说，美国将从中国其他地区撤销香港作为海关和旅行领土的优惠待遇。
北京的决定将中国安全机构的影响范围扩大到曾经是自由的堡垒，”特朗普表示。
特朗普上周威胁要永久终止美国对世卫组织的资助和成员资格，除非它致力于推动改革，而他没有公开细节。
星期五刚过一周，特朗普先生说世卫组织“拒绝采取行动”。
它补充说，出于正当理由来美国的学生不会受到影响。

The US will revoke Hong Kong's preferential treatment as a customs and travel territory from the rest of China, said Mr Trump at the White House Rose Garden.
Beijing's decision extends the reach of China's security apparatus into what was once a bastion of liberty,” said Mr Trump.
Mr Trump last week threatened to permanently end America's funding for and membership of the WHO unless it committed to snap reforms, which he did not publicly detail.
Just over a week later on Friday, Mr Trump said the WHO “refused to act”.
It added that students who come to the United States for legitimate reasons would not be affected.

该市政府星期四晚些时候表示：“任何制裁都是一把双刃剑，不仅会损害香港的利益，而且还会大大损害美国的利益。”
可以看到中国情报机构在香港设立了基地。
中国公安部表示将“指导和支持香港警察制止暴力并恢复秩序”。
但是，许多香港居民认为自己的城市正处于历史性变革的风口浪尖上。
“当香港真正失去特殊地位时，中国将看到后果。

"Any sanctions are a double-edged sword that will not only harm the interests of Hong Kong but also significantly those of the US," the city's government said late on Thursday.
It could see Chinese intelligence agencies set up bases in Hong Kong.
China’s Ministry of Public Security (MPS) said it would “guide and support Hong Kong police to stop violence and restore order”.
Many Hong Kong residents feel their city is on the cusp of historic change, however.
“When Hong Kong really loses special status, China will see the consequences.

## 台湾在具有里程碑意义的裁决中将通奸定罪

台北（路透社）-台湾宪法法院于5月29日星期五在一项具有里程碑意义的判决中将通奸罪合法化，该判决旨在维护人身权利和隐私，取消了一项活动人士称歧视妇女的法律。
宪法法院废除了通奸法，这意味着与已婚者或未婚者发生性行为的人可能面临长达一年的监禁。
他说，通奸法违反了一个人的性自主权，并且“严重侵犯了隐私”。
在去年同性婚姻具有里程碑意义的合法化之后，右翼激进分子欢迎该裁决为台湾改革奠定了“新的里程碑”。
在包括美国某些州在内的许多地方，通奸仍被视为犯罪。

TAIPEI (REUTERS) - Taiwan's constitutional court on Friday (May 29) decriminalised adultery in a landmark judgment aimed at upholding personal rights and privacy, scrapping a law that activists said discriminated against women.
The constitutional court struck down the adultery law that meant those who had sex with a married person, or with a person outside marriage, could face up to a year in jail.
The adultery law was a violation of a person's sexual autonomy as well as a "serious invasion of privacy", he said.
Right activists welcomed the ruling a "new milestone" for Taiwan's reforms following the landmark legalisation of same-sex marriage last year.
Adultery is still considered a crime in various places including some US states.

汉城（周五）（5月29日），韩国政府对首尔及其周边地区上学的学生人数进行了限制，因为官员们争相处理新的冠状病毒病例，威胁到该国成功遏制该流行病。
韩国遭受了中国大陆以外地区最严重的早期疾病暴发之一，但由于实施了广泛的“追踪，测试和治疗”计划，而且从未实施强制封锁，该疾病似乎已得到控制。
南方周四报告说，这是近两个月以来新感染病例的最大高峰，但周五的增幅降至58，使其总数达到11,402。
副教育部长Park Ba​​eg-beom说：“我们一直在建议Coupang员工及其家庭成员不要去任何学校。”
从星期五开始，博物馆，公园和美术馆再次关闭了两个星期，同时敦促公司重新引入灵活的工作方式。

SEOUL (AFP) - South Korea on Friday (May 29) imposed limits on the number of pupils going to schools in and around Seoul as officials scramble to tackle fresh coronavirus cases that threaten the country's success in containing the epidemic.
South Korea endured one of the worst early outbreaks of the disease outside mainland China, but appears to have brought it under control thanks to an extensive "trace, test and treat" programme while never imposing a compulsory lockdown.
The South on Thursday reported its biggest spike in new infections in nearly two months, but Friday's increase fell to 58, taking its total to 11,402.
"We have been advising Coupang employees and their family members" not to visit any schools, said vice-education minister Park Baeg-beom.
Museums, parks and art galleries were closed again from Friday for two weeks, while companies were urged to reintroduce flexible working.

东京（路透社）-东京都知事小池百合子（Yuriko Koike）援引咨询小组的建议说，自周一（6月1日）起，将进一步放宽日本首都东京遏制冠状病毒的遏制措施。
小池在周五的新闻发布会上说，补习班的学校，体育馆和剧院是可以逐步放松的设施之一。
她引述专家小组的话说，只要东京采取必要的预防措施来遏制病毒的传播，该市就可以“逐步采取逐步遏制遏制措施的措施”。
在日感染量下降之后，日本本周解除了对东京的紧急状态。
该国已记录了约17,000例感染，约900人死于该病毒。

TOKYO (REUTERS) - Curbs in Japan's capital of Tokyo to contain the coronavirus are to be eased further from Monday (June 1), Governor Yuriko Koike said, citing the recommendation of an advisory panel.
Cram schools, gyms, and theatres are among the facilities that will be allowed to reopen in a phased relaxation process, Koike told a news conference on Friday.
The city can "move to the next step of the phased easing of curbs, as long as Tokyo takes the necessary precautions to contain the spread of the virus", she quoted the panel as having said.
Japan lifted its state of emergency for Tokyo this week, following a drop in daily infections.
The country has recorded about 17,000 infections and some 900 deaths from the virus.
