自从一周前推出以来，在线纪念纪念英国死于冠状病毒的人的在线书已经输入了3,000多个名字。
该纪念册名为“记住我”，是由伦敦圣保罗大教堂在威尔士亲王的支持下组织的。
大教堂院长戴维·艾森（David Ison）牧师说，他们对在线书的反应“不知所措”。
他说：“看到家人，朋友和照顾者的来信一直令人难以置信。”
它对所有信仰的人开放，也可以不开放，死者必须是英国人或居住在英国。

An online book of remembrance to commemorate those who have died from coronavirus in the UK has had more than 3,000 names entered since it launched a week ago.
The memorial book, called Remember Me, has been organised by St. Paul’s Cathedral in London with the support of the Prince of Wales.
The Dean of the Cathedral, the Very Reverend David Ison, said they had been “overwhelmed by the response” to the online book.
“It has been incredibly moving to see the messages from family, friends and carers," he said.
It’s open to people of all faiths, or none, and the deceased person must be British or have been living in the UK.

瑞典没有像北欧邻国那样实行封锁，其Covid-19死亡人数-超过4,000-迄今为止是斯堪的纳维亚半岛最高的。
丹麦总理梅特·弗雷德里克森（Mette Frederiksen）说，关于大流行，丹麦和瑞典位于不同的地方。
丹麦还在限制范围内与德国和冰岛开放旅游业。
瑞典的1000万人口也超过了丹麦（580万）或挪威（540万）的人口。
在瑞典电视台周五报道的评论中，她说瑞典希望有一个共同的北欧解决方案，但这是不可能的。

Sweden did not impose a lockdown, unlike its Nordic neighbours, and its Covid-19 death toll - above 4,000 - is by far the highest in Scandinavia.
Danish PM Mette Frederiksen said Denmark and Sweden were in different places regarding the pandemic.
Denmark is also opening up tourism with Germany and Iceland, within limits.
Sweden's 10 million population is also bigger than that of Denmark (5.8 million) or Norway (5.4 million).
In comments reported by Swedish TV on Friday, she said Sweden had hoped for a common Nordic solution but it was impossible.

考古研究发现，在以色列阿拉德的一座寺庙的祭坛上发现了大麻残留物。古代以色列人焚烧大麻作为其宗教仪式的一部分。
在特拉德（Tel Arad）一座拥有2700年历史的庙宇中发现的保存完好的物质已被确认为大麻，包括其精神活性化合物THC。
研究人员得出结论，大麻可能被焚烧，以在崇拜者中引起较高的消费量。
这项研究还补充说，特拉德（Tel Arad）的发现表明，大麻在耶路撒冷圣殿的崇拜中也发挥了作用。
考古学家现在无法接近耶路撒冷圣殿的遗迹，因此，他们研究了阿拉德和其他类似的神社，以帮助他们了解较大圣殿的崇拜。

A well-preserved substance found in a 2,700-year-old temple in Tel Arad has been identified as cannabis, including its psychoactive compound THC.
Researchers concluded that cannabis may have been burned in order to induce a high among worshippers.
The study adds that the findings in Tel Arad suggest that cannabis also played a role in worship at the Temple of Jerusalem.
The remains of the temple in Jerusalem are now inaccessible to archaeologists, so instead they study Arad and other similar shrines to help them understand worship at the larger temple.

Cany说，航空公司通常会根据过去的需求来预测未来的趋势。
他说，这是“了解客户旅行的动机以及他们愿意为机票支付多少钱。
航空公司希望为航空公司和旅客争取最优惠的价格。”这既是一门科学，也是一门艺术。
航空公司通常会控制供应杠杆，并且通常了解到，当他们想刺激需求以满载时，就会降低票价。
目前的X要素是，由于卫生问题，锁定指南和隔离规则，许多人不敢出行。

Airlines, Cany says, usually look at past demand to forecast future trends.
This, he says, “is about understanding the customer's motivation to travel and how much they are willing to pay for the ticket.
The airline wants to strike the best deal for the airline and the traveller.”This is both a science and an art.
Airlines usually have the lever of supply under their control, and it’s generally understood that when they want to stimulate demand to fill capacity, they reduce fares.
The X factor right now is that many people are scared to travel because of hygiene concerns, lockdown guidance and quarantine rules.

特朗普先生说，他不再认为香港与中国分开。
他说：“这是香港的悲剧。中国扼杀了香港的自由。”
尚不清楚有关根据新的安全法将要禁止的行为的确切详细信息。
中国驻香港外交部将美国对新法律草案的批评描述为“完全imp亵，不合理和无耻”。

But many people there see the looming security law as bringing an end to Hong Kong's special status, agreed under a 1984 agreement between China and the UK.
Mr Trump said that he no longer considered Hong Kong to be separate from China.
"This is a tragedy for Hong Kong... China has smothered Hong Kong's freedom," he said.
Full details about exactly what behaviour will be outlawed under the new security law are not yet clear.
China's foreign ministry in Hong Kong described US criticism of the new draft law as "utterly imperious, unreasonable and shameless".

法国将有约4,600个工作岗位，雷诺表示正在对6家工厂进行审查，以考虑削减和关闭工厂。
雷诺淡化了其可能将部分生产转移至由其战略合作伙伴日产（Nissan）经营的英国工厂的报道。
德尔博斯女士补充说，雷诺将审查每个地区，以确定裁员的范围。
这也许可以解释为什么雷诺今天淡化了一些报道，称该报道可能会将日产在桑德兰的英国工厂投入生产。
让法国纳税人帮助扶持一家公司，然后在英国创造就业机会并不是一个好主意。

Some 4,600 jobs will go in France, and Renault has said six plants are under review for possible cuts and closure.
Renault played down reports it could move some production to the UK plant run by its strategic partner Nissan.
Ms Delbos added that Renault would review each region in order to decide where job cuts will fall.
That might explain why Renault today played down reports it could put some production into Nissan's UK plant at Sunderland.
Having French taxpayers help prop up a company that then creates jobs in the UK is not a good look.

The chancellor says the government can't go on meeting the full cost of the furlough scheme.
During August the government will pay 80% of wages up to a cap of £2,500.

无论波兰语使用者是将“冠状病毒”转换成动词还是英语使用者都想知道“冠状病毒婴儿”（在大流行期间出生或怀孕的孩子）的生活状况，许多人都以“冠状病毒”为前缀。
像其他人一样，词汇学家也争先恐后地跟上流行病的变化。
根据牛津英语词典（OED）高级编辑Fiona McPherson的说法，早在12月，“冠状病毒”的出现率仅为百万分之一令牌的0.03倍（令牌是OED语料库中收集和追踪的最小语言单位）。
“ Covid-19”一词仅在2月，即世界卫生组织宣布该病毒的正式名称时才被创造出来。
但是在4月份，“ Covid-19”和“冠状病毒”的数量猛增至每百万个令牌约1,750个（建议这两个术语现在的使用频率大致相同）。

Many use ‘corona’ as a prefix, whether Polish speakers convert ‘coronavirus’ into a verb or English speakers wonder how ‘coronababies’ (the children born or conceived during the pandemic) will fare.
Old words in a new lightLike everyone else, lexicologists are scrambling to keep up with the changes the pandemic has wrought.
According to Fiona McPherson, the senior editor of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), back in December ‘coronavirus’ appeared only 0.03 times per million tokens (tokens are the smallest units of language collected and tracked in the OED corpus).
The term ‘Covid-19’ was only coined in February, when the WHO announced the official name of the virus.
But in April, the figures for both ‘Covid-19’ and ‘coronavirus’ had skyrocketed to about 1,750 per million tokens (suggesting that the two terms are now being used at roughly the same frequency).

在这个平台的顶部，我们正在研究许多可以放在顶部的解决方案，就像农民的拖拉机一样。
其中之一就是我们的奇异果收获机，它最初是由我的联合创始人阿利斯泰尔·斯卡夫（Alistair Scarfe）在新西兰北帕默斯顿的梅西大学攻读博士学位期间开发的。
他已经证明，可以使用机器人识别水果，伸出手，将其从植物上拉出并收集在料斗上。
将其安装在移动平台上意味着它可以收获水果，将水果按大小分类到箱中，然后运回包装室，然后再赶回去进行采摘。

On top of this platform we are working on a number of solutions that can be clipped on top, much like a farmer’s tractor.
One of these is our kiwi-fruit harvester, which was initially developed by my co-founder Alistair Scarfe during his PhD at Massey University, in Palmerston North, New Zealand.
He has proven that it is possible to use a robot to identify fruit, reach up, pull it off the plant and collect it on a hopper.
Mounting this on a mobile platform means it can harvest fruit, sort them into bins by size and deliver them to the pack house before driving back out to carry on picking.
