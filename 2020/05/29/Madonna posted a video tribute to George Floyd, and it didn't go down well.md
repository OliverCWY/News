(CNN) Amid the widespread outrage over the death of Minneapolis security guard George Floyd, Madonna is coming under fire for a social media misstep.

As anger grew at footage showing a police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck as he died, the singer Thursday tweeted a two-minute clip of her son, David Banda, dancing to Michael Jackson's song "They Don't Care About Us."

She wrote in the caption: "Brutal murder travels around the world my son David Dances to honor and pay tribute to George and His Family and all Acts of Racism and Discrimination that happen on a daily basis in America. \#davidbanda \#JusticeforGeorgeFloyd \#MichaelJackson."

But the hitmaker was mocked by several commentators for an insensitive response to the story, which has sparked protests in a number of major cities.
