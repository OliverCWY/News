Waste researcher Nate Maynard remembers exactly when he realised that bins were nearly impossible to find in Taiwan’s capital city, Taipei. He first came to Taiwan in 2013 for a research trip as part of his environment masters programme. “When I arrived, the most obvious thing to me was that not only were there no litter bins, there was no litter either.”

The situation was vastly different 20 years before, after accelerated economic progress saw Taiwan lauded as one of Asia’s economic tigers, along with Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea. But the price of economic success was high. Archive news reports say that in 1979, local governments were gathering up 8,800 metric tonnes of municipal solid waste a day. By 1990, that number had hit 18,800 tonnes. In 1992, it was still climbing, at 21,900 tonnes. Taiwan had acquired the unpleasant nickname of “garbage island”.

A total of 90% of the waste collected was heading straight into landfills that didn’t meet government sanitation requirements. Nearly all of the island’s landfills were at capacity, brimming with commercial and industrial waste. In one instance, officials from the former Taipei suburb of Hsinchuang – which today is part of New Taipei City – were having to dump 5,000 metric tonnes of trash in one go at an emergency site near Hsinchuang’s water pumping station, because its original landfill was causing a stench. The situation was so dire officials were worried that poor sanitation conditions would lead to an outbreak of dengue fever.
