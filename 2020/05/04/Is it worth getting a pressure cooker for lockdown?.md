The steam trapped inside the pressure cooker builds up pressure to twice that of our normal atmosphere, so the temperature of the liquid can rise above the boiling point of water (100C/212F). Heat cannot escape, so the cooking temperature is maintained with minimal energy input. A pressure cooker saves 90 percent of the energy used to boil a pot on the hob.

Some foods are perfect to cook under these hot and steamy conditions: a meat stock, for instance, takes advantage of all the pressure cooker’s benefits. The higher temperature breaks down the collagen in the bones and tissues quickly, creating body and richness. Flavour is extracted efficiently as it’s not floating away in steam. The pressurised atmosphere keeps gas from bubbling out of the stock, creating less agitation and making a clearer stock. And the sealed pressure cooker eliminates the need for topping up the water. In all, a chicken stock that would take 4 hours to cook on the hob is done in 45 minutes (and there’s no steamy kitchen).

Having fresh stock in the freezer is a great shortcut to dinner. “It’s just the most useful thing to have”, says Pippa, “because you can put it in anything – you can put it in a risotto, have it with noodles – that’s my favourite thing and if I don’t have that in my freezer, I panic\! I just put the ice block of broth in a pan and it defrosts very quickly.”

Pippa’s Pho ga (Vietnamese chicken soup) takes 1 hour of hands-off cooking. “I just bung all the ingredients in a pressure cooker when I get home from work. Then I can go upstairs, have a shower, get changed, come downstairs and it’ll be ready.”
