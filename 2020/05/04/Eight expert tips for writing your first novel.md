2. Use your situation as an inspiration

The world is in the middle of a crisis, with lives turned upside down on a personal level. Could this provide the subject matter for you novel? “I do think a crisis is a great time to start writing if you’re alone at home, if you’ve got the mental capacity to do it,” suggests Nikita Lalwani. “Often writing can start, for me, from a sense of unease: it’s from interrogating that unease that the jeopardy comes, the jeopardy that’s required to create art. There’s a quote from the writer Don DeLillo, where he says: “I begin to recognise myself, word by word, as I work through a sentence.” I’ve always thought that; that [writing] can be a great act of self-knowing.”

3. Ask yourself a question you don’t know the answer to

One way to start yourself on the path to a finished book is to try to figure something out through the process of writing,. “You could start by answering a question that you don’t know the answer to; something that has troubled you in your own life,” says Nikita. “I normally start with something where I can see both sides of the story. So I can’t understand whether my response to a situation is right or left.”

4. Think about how your story will end

Nikita also suggests planning where your story will end, even if you don’t know how you’ll get there: “I don’t know if you need a structure in place, but I often think it’s good to try to force yourself to think about the ending, because the ending reveals your intention, even if the ending will change – and it usually does.

5. Get to know your characters as you write

Interesting characters are crucial to an interesting novel, and Owen suggests looking for them in real life. “Like lots of writers, I try to keep notes of interesting traits or people or characteristics that I see around me,” he says.

For Nikita the process of writing puts flesh on the bones. “You can only find out your characters sometimes by writing them,” she says. “You need to allow yourself the draft in which you write the characters, find out who they are, [then] go back and rewrite the book knowing and understanding them.”
