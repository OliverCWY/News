特殊的关系新西兰和澳大利亚成为彼此的首选是有几个原因。
包容性也可能对该地区产生巨大的软实力影响，这对新西兰，澳大利亚和中国具有战略意义。
罗伯茨和韦斯特威说，潜在的澳大利亚和新西兰旅行泡沫可能最终成为世界其他地区的榜样。

The inclusion could also have a huge soft power impact in the region, which is of strategic importance to New Zealand, Australia and China.
A potential Australia and New Zealand travel bubble may end up being a model for the rest of the world, Roberts and Westaway say.

华盛顿（CNN）据美国国土安全部的一份报告称，中国政府有意向国际社会隐瞒了冠状病毒的严重性，同时它储存了进口商品并减少了出口。
消息人士称，这份评估今年初进出口数据的报告于周五在联邦政府内部散发。
当被问及中国是否在1月初隐瞒了Covid-19的严重性时，中国是否有意储存医疗用品时，庞培在接受美国广播公司的“本周”采访时说：“事实已经正确了。”
消息人士说，可以合理地得出结论，根据疫情，在宣布大流行之前，中国将认识到确定个人防护装备需求的关键措施。
当被问及中国是否有意释放该病毒还是意外事故时，庞培拒绝发表任何意见。

Washington (CNN) The Chinese government intentionally concealed the severity of the coronavirus from the international community while it stockpiled imports and decreased exports, a Department of Homeland Security report found, according to an administration official familiar with the report.
The report, which assessed export and import data earlier this year, was circulated within the federal government on Friday, the source said.
"You've got the facts just about right," Pompeo told ABC's "This Week" when asked if China intentionally stockpiled medical supplies in early January while it concealed the severity of Covid-19.
It is reasonable to conclude that based on the outbreak, before it was declared pandemic, China would recognize key measurements in determining requirements for the need of personal protective equipment, the source said.
Asked about whether China intentionally released the virus or if it was an accident, Pompeo refused to give an opinion.

日本当局正在提供紧急住房，以支持那些生活在网吧中的人们，但是这种大流行措施暴露了一个可以追溯到几十年前的问题。
在这些人中，有4000名是网吧难民，而有1000多名失业者，住在桥下，纸板箱和公园和河岸的帐篷中。
戴着防护口罩的顾客于2020年4月12日星期日晚上在日本东京涩谷区进入一家网吧。
要获得资格，人们需要出示网吧会员卡或携带收据证明自己一直住在网吧中。
在4月21日之前，网吧难民需要提供证明他们在东京生活了6个月。

The Japanese authorities are providing emergency housing to support those living in internet cafes, but the pandemic measures have exposed a problem that goes back decades.
Of those, 4,000 are internet cafe refugees, while more than 1,000 are unemployed and live under bridges and in cardboard boxes and tents in parks and along river banks.

Before April 21, internet cafe refugees needed to have proof they'd lived in Tokyo for 6 months.

纽约（CNN商业）总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）选择了最糟糕的时间来重新发起与中国的贸易战。
请记住，美国对中国的关税不会直接惩罚中国-美国的企业和家庭要支付这些税款的费用，而不是北京。
过去，争夺中国的论点是，美国经济足够强大，可以承受贸易战。
当被问及是否考虑让美国不履行对华债务时，特朗普表示担心美元贬值。
我们可以用关税来做到这一点，”特朗普说。

New York (CNN Business) President Donald Trump has picked the worst possible time to relaunch his trade battle with China.
Keep in mind that US tariffs on China don't directly punish China -- US businesses and households pay the cost of those taxes, not Beijing.
In the past, the argument for taking the fight to China was that the United States economy was strong enough to withstand a trade war.
Asked if he would consider having the United States not pay its debt obligations to China, Trump expressed concern about undermining the US dollar.
We can do it with tariffs," Trump said.

（CNN）虽然世界上大多数职业运动都在举行，但篮球模拟视频游戏的明星们已经为行动做好了准备。
NBA 2K联赛已经正式进行了三年的电子竞技，由美国国家篮球协会和虚拟游戏公司Take-Two Interactive共同运营。
尽管冠状病毒大流行，但联盟的23支球队仍将在至少六个星期的比赛中远程争夺冠军，从5月5日开始，同时在NBA 2K联盟的Twitch和YouTube频道上同时直播比赛。
NBA 2K总经理Brendan Donohu表示，他希望比赛将为“新老球迷提供一种有趣的方式，以在这种前所未有的时期保持联系并与我们的联盟互动”。
他补充说：“在为赛季做准备的过程中，我们的球员一直在与队友隔离，现在他们将有机会相互竞争，表明他们是世界上最好的球员。”

The NBA 2K League has been an official esport for three years and is run by both the National Basketball Association and virtual game company Take-Two Interactive.
Despite the coronavirus pandemic, the league's 23 teams will still compete for the title remotely over at least six weeks of competition, starting May 5, with games simulcast live on the NBA 2K League's Twitch and YouTube channels.
NBA 2K managing director Brendan Donohu said he hoped the competition will provide "both new and returning fans with a fun way to stay connected and engage with our league during these unprecedented times."
He added: "Our players have been quarantining with their teammates as they prepare for the season and will now have the opportunity to compete against one another and show they are the best players in the world."

They weren't actually in the same location but rather took part from France, Mississippi and Louisiana.
And without any officials to help out, it wasn't the pole vaulter who cleared the top height who won but rather the one who cleared five meters the most in two halves of 15 minutes.

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议厅”轰炸而丧生。
后来空袭被认为是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

当女孩们反对时，他们说格拉泽会威胁要把他们赶出去。
一些幸存者说，格拉瑟（Glaser）介绍自己是一名医生，但支持起诉的律师告诉美国有线电视新闻网（CNN），他是物理治疗师-不是合格的医生。
Dilen于去年2月在Bery's Place进行的一次警察突袭中因警察的讯问而被捕，后来被释放。
但至少现在，他们说他们开始在贝里故居之外享受生活。

But five women in their late teens and early twenties interviewed by CNN, including Patricia, allege that Glaser sexually and emotionally abused them at Bery's Place.
When the girls objected, they say Glaser would threaten to cast them out on the streets.
Some survivors say Glaser introduced himself as a doctor, but lawyers supporting the prosecution told CNN that he is a physiotherapist -- not a qualified physician.
