Creating a safe working environment in factories is "totally doable" but comes at a price, according to a director at a British sausage manufacturer.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Declan Ferguson of Finnebrogue Artisan says its social distancing measures have included staggering shifts and breaks, providing face masks on the factory floor, and paying workers more to keep the rules.

"We've introduced a social distancing bonus so workers get one pound an hour extra when they follow rules - and we have also introduced social distancing marshals, they are the policemen on the factory floor," he says.

"We are spending around £100,000 per week to pay for additional staff, bonuses and the cost of the PPE.

"People need to feel safe - we have things like hand sanitiser stations as people arrive, doors are left open where possible, and physical markings on the ground are vital to be able to do that."
