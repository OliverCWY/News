东京（路透社）-日本首相安倍晋三周一（5月4日）表示，他已决定将日本的紧急状态延至5月31日。
他在政府的冠状病毒特别工作组会议上说，如果专家顾问根据对区域感染趋势的详细分析认为可能的话，安倍晋三将考虑取消紧急状态，而无需等待5月31日届满。
安倍晋三表示：“基于这种观点，我将把4月7日宣布的紧急状态延至5月31日，”他补充说，这种状态仍将在全国范围内进行。
安倍晋三说，对于受灾最严重的13个县，包括东京和大阪，将人与人之间的接触减少80％的目标仍然存在。

TOKYO (REUTERS) - Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Monday (May 4) he had decided to extend the country's national state of emergency to May 31.
Mr Abe will consider lifting the state of emergency without waiting for its May 31 expiration if expert advisors decide that is possible based on detailed analysis of regional infection trends, he said at a meeting of the government’s coronavirus task force.
“Based on that view, I will extend the state of emergency that was announced on April 7 until May 31,” Mr Abe said, adding that it would remain nationwide.
For the 13 prefectures including Tokyo and Osaka that have been hardest hit, a target of reducing person-to-person contacts by 80 per cent would remain in place, Mr Abe said.

## 为什么乔·拜登（Joe Biden）选择竞选伴侣会产生重大影响

但是，势力的融合改变了乔·拜登寻找民主党候选人的竞选伙伴的方式。
如果真是这样，那么他的竞选伙伴现在很有可能在四年内领先民主党。
密苏里州前参议员克莱尔·麦卡斯基尔（Claire McCaskill）甚至对即将到来的事情感到直言不讳：“您正在写票成为第一位女总统。”
还有其他因素使拜登的决定如此重要。
许多民主党人相信，像前副总统这样的直觉政客会选择他已采取措施的人。

But a convergence of forces has transformed Joe Biden's search for a running mate on the Democratic ticket.
If that turns out to be the case, his running mate now could well be leading the Democratic ticket in four years.
Former Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri was even blunter about what is at stake: "You're writing your ticket to be the first woman president."
There are other factors that have made Biden's decision so momentous.
Many Democrats believe a gut politician like the former vice president will pick somebody whose measure he has taken.
