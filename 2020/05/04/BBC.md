英国香肠制造商的一位负责人说，在工厂创造一个安全的工作环境是“完全可行的”，但要付出一定的代价。
Finnebrogue Artisan的Declan Ferguson在接受BBC Radio 4的Today节目采访时说，其社会疏离措施包括惊人的轮班和休息时间，在工厂车间戴上口罩以及向工人支付更多费用以遵守规定。
他说：“我们推出了社交疏散奖金，使工人在遵守规则的情况下每小时可多赚一磅-我们还引入了社交疏散元帅，他们是工厂的警察。”
“我们每周花费约100,000英镑来支付额外的员工，奖金和个人防护装备的成本。
“人们需要感到安全-当人们到达时，我们会有诸如手动消毒站之类的东西，门要尽可能敞开，地面上的物理标记对于做到这一点至关重要。”

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Declan Ferguson of Finnebrogue Artisan says its social distancing measures have included staggering shifts and breaks, providing face masks on the factory floor, and paying workers more to keep the rules.
"We've introduced a social distancing bonus so workers get one pound an hour extra when they follow rules - and we have also introduced social distancing marshals, they are the policemen on the factory floor," he says.
"We are spending around £100,000 per week to pay for additional staff, bonuses and the cost of the PPE.
"People need to feel safe - we have things like hand sanitiser stations as people arrive, doors are left open where possible, and physical markings on the ground are vital to be able to do that."

如您所料，给某人一个氧气罐来呼吸会逆转这些变化。
您不会期望的是，如果氧气罐是假的，那么您可以实现完全相同的目的–它是空的。
“血液中没有氧气，体内没有氧气，但是您可以获得与真实氧气完全相同的效果。
真正的答案是我们不清楚。
任何职业运动员都会告诉您，他们对获胜的信念在成功中扮演着重要的角色，研究表明，通过改变他们的期望，安慰剂效应可以对他们走多快或走多远产生强大影响。

As you might expect, giving someone an oxygen tank to breathe from will reverse these changes.
What you wouldn’t expect is that you can achieve exactly the same thing if the oxygen tank is a fake – it’s empty.
“There is no oxygen in the blood, there is no oxygen in the body, but you can get the very same effect as real oxygen.
The real answer is we don’t know.”Harder, faster, strongerWe normally hear about the placebo effect in a medical context.
Any professional athlete will tell you that their beliefs about winning play a huge role in success, and research suggests that by modifying their expectations, the placebo effect can have a powerful impact on how fast or how far they can go.

The town hall - or community meeting featuring viewers' questions - was intended to relaunch Mr Trump's presidential campaign in lieu of rallies.
Mr Trump also laid some of the blame at the door of US intelligence officials, accusing them of failing to raise concerns about the outbreak until 23 January.
However, US broadcasters CNN and ABC report that the president's intelligence briefings mentioned the coronavirus as early as 3 January.

巴克莱银行英国老板马特·哈默斯坦（Matt Hammerstein）表示，该银行在上午9点启动后的第一分钟，收到了200份所谓的反弹贷款申请。
该计划提供的金额比现有的冠状病毒商业中断贷款计划（CBILS）少。
根据CBILS，营业额少于4500万英镑的公司可获得最高500万英镑的贷款。
周四，CBILS同意的贷款数量为8,638，低于前一周的9,000。
小型企业联合会主席迈克·切里（Mike Cherry）说，这为小型企业“带来了真正的希望”。

Barclays' UK boss Matt Hammerstein said the bank got 200 applications for so-called bounce back loans in the first minute after they launched at 9am.
The scheme offers smaller amounts than the existing Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS).
Under CBILS, loans of up to £5m are available for companies with a turnover of less than £45m.
On Thursday, the number of CBILS loans agreed was 8,638, down from more than 9,000 the previous week.
It "offers real hope" for small firms, says Mike Cherry, head of the Federation of Small Businesses.

更重要的是，《帝国反击》显然是所有特许经营问题的根源。
这只是《帝国反击》要求我们假装没有发生《星球大战》的众多案例中的第一个。
算了吧-因为在《帝国反击战》中，我们被告知皇帝本人也致力于同一宗教。
尽管有《帝国反击战》的称号，但它很少涉及联盟v帝国，而是关于谁与谁有关系以及谁爱上谁（两者有时会重叠）。
抱歉，《帝国反击战》必须归咎于所有人。

What’s more, it seems obvious that The Empire Strikes Back is the source of all the franchise’s problems.
And it’s just the first of many instances when The Empire Strikes Back asks us to pretend that Star Wars didn’t happen.
Forget it – because in The Empire Strikes Back we’re told that the Emperor himself is devoted to the same religion.
Despite its title, The Empire Strikes Back is rarely about the Alliance v the Empire, it’s about who is related to whom and who is in love with whom (the two sometimes overlap).
I’m sorry, but The Empire Strikes Back has to take the blame for all of them.

高压锅内积聚的蒸汽将压力提高到正常大气压力的两倍，因此液体的温度可能会升高到水的沸点（100C / 212F）以上。
高压锅可节省90％的能量，将锅上的锅煮沸。

密封的压力锅消除了对水的注水的需要。
“我下班回家时，只是把所有食材都塞进了压力锅。

The steam trapped inside the pressure cooker builds up pressure to twice that of our normal atmosphere, so the temperature of the liquid can rise above the boiling point of water (100C/212F).
A pressure cooker saves 90 percent of the energy used to boil a pot on the hob.
Some foods are perfect to cook under these hot and steamy conditions: a meat stock, for instance, takes advantage of all the pressure cooker’s benefits.
And the sealed pressure cooker eliminates the need for topping up the water.
