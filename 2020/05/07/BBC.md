1840年代，乔克托民族（Choctaw Nation）向爱尔兰汇出了170美元（约合今天的5,000美元），当时有100万爱尔兰人在马铃薯饥荒中丧生。
他们的慷慨之举部分是由于许多美国原住民在眼泪小径上的死亡，60 000人被迫流离失所而引起的。
现在，纳瓦霍族和霍皮人保留区受到了冠状病毒的严重影响，部分原因是缺乏清洁水，爱尔兰人民通过向募捐人捐款10万美元来认识到这种古老的恩惠。
帕特·海斯（Pat Hayes）的一则讯息是：“ 170年后，从爱尔兰回来了，恩宠！

The Choctaw Nation sent $170 (around $5,000 in today's money) to Ireland in the 1840s when one million Irish people died during the potato famine.
Their genorosity was sparked partly by the deaths of many Native Americans on the Trail of Tears, the forced displacement of 60,000 people.
Now the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Reservation are badly affected by the coronavirus, partly due to a lack of clean water, and Irish people are recognising the old kindness by donating $100,000 to a fundraiser.
One message, from Pat Hayes, read: “From Ireland, 170 years later, the favour is returned\!

美国联邦教育部长贝西·德沃斯（Betsey DeVos）根据联邦准则，美国大学必须就校园性侵犯指控举行听证会，以便对被指控的受害者和袭击者进行盘问。
该授权是美国教育部关于学习场所必须如何处理性行为不端案件的一套新规则的一部分。
上届政府曾试图根据标题IX扩大大学对校园中性行为不当的责任。
“这项新规定要求学校以有意义的方式采取行动，以支持性行为不端的幸存者，而又不牺牲重要的保障措施以确保过程的公正透明。”
但是，宣传团体表示，最终政策削减了受害者的权利。

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption US Education Secretary Betsey DeVosUS universities must hold hearings on campus sexual assault claims where alleged victims and attackers can be cross-examined, according to federal guidelines.
The mandate is part of a new set of US Department of Education rules on how places of learning must handle sexual misconduct cases.
The previous administration had sought to expand university responsibility for sexual misconduct on campuses under Title IX.
"This new regulation requires schools to act in meaningful ways to support survivors of sexual misconduct, without sacrificing important safeguards to ensure a fair and transparent process."
However, advocacy groups said the final policy cut back on victims' rights.

由于存在如此巨大的悬殊，许多人怀疑旧金山的进取心胸开阔的态度能否生存下去。
•旧金山为何要发酸
旧金山几乎在一夜之间变成了一个新兴城市-一个无法无天的地方，赌博厅和妓院泛滥成灾，男性人口远远超过女性。
惠誉（Fitch）在当晚的报纸上发表了这一宣言，很快，一个新的旧金山传奇诞生了。

With so much disparity, many wonder whether San Francisco’s progressive, open-minded attitude can survive.
• Why San Francisco does sourdough best“San Francisco has been a city of change since day one,” Amster, a city tour guide and amateur San Francisco historian, told me.
San Francisco became a boomtown practically overnight – a lawless place where gambling halls and brothels ran rampant and the male population far outweighed the female.
Fitch printed the proclamation in that evening’s paper, and soon enough a new San Francisco legend was born.

表面上，冠状病毒使世界停滞不前。
值得庆幸的是，在大多数情况下，这些事件并未从我们的生活中完全消失，而是从我们的眼光转向了遥远的视野。
但是，当您与世隔绝的许多人和资源隔离开来时，究竟该如何保持游戏准备状态呢？
毕竟，您不知道何时该被召唤来挑战。
平衡您的期望可能很棘手，但是在大多数情况下，一旦事件发生，您至少可以部分了解结果。

The coronavirus has ostensibly put the world on hold.
Thankfully, in most cases, these events haven’t fully vanished from our lives – instead, they’ve shifted from our immediate sight to the distant horizon.
But how, exactly, are you supposed to stay game-ready when you’re stuck in isolation, separated from many of the people and resources you’re accustomed to?
After all, you don’t know when you’re going to be called to rise to the challenge.
Balancing your expectations can be tricky, but in most cases, once the event has transpired, you can find at least partial relief in knowing the outcome.

问题是：这些突变中的哪些实际上能改变疾病的严重程度或传染性？
美国的初步研究表明，一种特殊的突变D614G正在占主导地位，并且可能使这种疾病更具感染性。
他们指出，这种特定的突变似乎使它更快地生长了一些-但其后果尚不清楚。
“突变不是一件坏事”伦敦大学学院（UCL）的另一项研究确定了该病毒的198个重复突变。
格拉斯哥大学（University of Glasgow）的一项研究也分析了突变，他说这些变化并不构成不同的病毒株。

The question is: which of these mutations actually do anything to change the severity or infectiousness of the disease?
Preliminary research from the US has suggested one particular mutation - D614G - is becoming dominant and could make the disease more infectious.
They noted there seems to be something about this particular mutation that makes it grow more quickly - but the consequences of this are not yet clear.
'Mutations not a bad thing'Another study from University College London (UCL) identified 198 recurring mutations to the virus.
A study from the University of Glasgow, which also analysed mutations, said these changes did not amount to different strains of the virus.

默克尔总理将负责解除对德国16个州的封锁，总理默克尔（Angela Merkel）表示德国已经实现了减缓冠状病毒传播的目标，因此随着锁定限制的放松，所有商店都可以重新开业。
默克尔总理说：“德国的表现要好于其他国家。”
德国的冠状病毒大流行死亡人数不到7,000人，这一数字远低于包括英国，意大利，法国和西班牙在内的其他西欧国家。
她称赞德国公民有责任采取封锁措施保护他人和自己生命的责任。
重新开放餐馆和酒店被视为一种特殊的风险，因为这将增加在德国旅行的人数并提高感染率。

'Germany doing better than other countries'"I think we can safely state that the very first phase of the pandemic is behind us," Chancellor Merkel said.
Germany has seen fewer than 7,000 deaths in the coronavirus pandemic - a much lower figure than in other Western European countries including the UK, Italy, France and Spain.
She praised the responsibility of German citizens in sticking to lockdown measures to protect the lives of others as well as themselves.
Reopening restaurants and hotels is seen as a particular risk because it will heighten the number of people travelling across Germany and raising infection rates.

首席执行官达拉·科斯罗萨西（Dara Khosrowshahi）也将放弃他的基本工资-到2019年年底定为100万美元（合809,690英镑）。
甚至在大流行之前，优步就在努力平衡收支平衡，在2019年亏损了85亿美元。
Uber表示，裁员将来自其客户支持和招聘团队，并将产生2000万美元的遣散费和其他费用。
他在一份报告中写道：“ Uber和Lyft面临着艰巨的挑战，因为新现实可能会在可预见的未来改变这些公司（和竞争对手）的商业模式。”
Lyft周三表示，随着美国开始执行停工令，Lyft的出行次数下降了70％以上。

Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi will also waive his base salary - set at $1m (£809,690) in 2019 - through to the year end.
Even before the pandemic, Uber was struggling to balance its books, making a loss of $8.5bn in 2019.
Uber said the reductions will come from its customer support and recruiting teams, and would result in $20m in severance pay and other costs.
"Uber and Lyft face Herculean-like challenges looking ahead as the new reality will likely change the business models of these companies [and competitors] for the foreseeable future," he wrote in a note.
On Wednesday, Lyft said it had seen a decline of more than 70% in trips on its platform as the US started to implement shutdown orders.

受影响的Debenhams商店位于伯明翰的斗牛场，雷丁的甲骨文，克罗伊登的Centrale，莱斯特的Highcross和格拉斯哥的Silverburn。
根据该协议，该零售商将在2020年关闭22家商店，在2021年关闭28家商店。
上个月，Debenhams仍然拥有142家商店，但由于冠状病毒迫使其暂时关闭其商店，它被迫再次任命管理员以保护公司免受债权人的侵害。
但是，除非威尔士政府撤销关于减免商业价格的决定，否则在威尔士的五家主要Debenhams商店的前景仍然值得怀疑。

The Debenhams stores affected are in the Bullring in Birmingham, The Oracle in Reading, Centrale in Croydon, Highcross in Leicester, and Silverburn in Glasgow.
Under the agreement, the retailer would close 22 stores in 2020 and 28 stores in 2021.
Last month, Debenhams still had 142 stores but it was forced to appoint administrators again to protect the business from its creditors as coronavirus forced it to temporarily shut its stores.
However, the future of five major Debenhams stores in Wales is still in doubt, unless the Welsh government reverses a decision on business rates relief.

根据欧盟委员会的一项新预测，欧盟面临着严重而又不均衡的衰退。
欧盟委员会预计今年经济活动将下降7.5％，略高于欧元区。
欧洲和其他国家的政府有意阻止经济活动遏制该病毒，因此急剧下滑是不可避免的。
严重地，不可避免地，对经济活动的如此广泛的影响将意味着失业。
因此，最早要到2022年，欧盟经济才能恢复到去年的水平。

The Commission predicts a decline in economic activity this year of 7.5%, and slightly more than that for the eurozone.
European and other governments are intentionally blocking economic activity to contain the virus, so a sharp downturn is inevitable.
SevereInevitably, such an extensive impact on economic activity will mean job losses.
It would therefore be 2022 at the earliest when the EU economy gets back to the level of activity it experienced last year.

他们的灯光和阴影Marvel Cinematic Universe确实是一个欢乐的世界。
当然，它涉及的是严肃的主题，例如反恐战争，政府的过度控制，以及整个宇宙的一半种族灭绝。
仙境传说（Ragnarok）可能是迄今为止Marvel最具特色的个人产品-尽管存在这个世俗的环境，但怀蒂提（Waitiiti）的呆滞，自我指责的幽默感使事情特别扎根和易于获取。

I’m going to explain to you why the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is my happy place in a moment but first I need to tell you about something sad.
Their light and shadeThe Marvel Cinematic Universe really is a joyous one.
Sure, it deals with serious subjects, like the war on terror, government overreach and, you know, the genocide of half the universe.
Ragnarok is probably the most distinctive individual Marvel offering so far – Waititi’s deadpan, self-referential humour keeps things especially grounded and accessible, despite the out-of-this-world setting.

我坚定地抵御微风，站在苏格兰和英国边界西南端的标志处调查现场。
人们认为，可争议土地是英国最后的大领土分区。
苏格兰和英格兰之间的界线是根据1237年的《约克条约》建立的。
正如格雷厄姆·罗伯（Graham Robb）在他2018年的书《有争议的土地：苏格兰和英格兰之间的失落世界》中所写的那样，它“可能是欧洲最古老的国界”。
这座人造堤防，今天几乎看不到，是一个三英里半长的屏障，最终将可耕地分成两部分。

Standing firm against a determined breeze, I was surveying the scene from what marks the south-western end of the border between Scotland and England.
The Debatable Lands is believed to have been the last great territorial division in Britain.
The line between Scotland and England was established with the Treaty of York in 1237.
As Graham Robb writes in his 2018 book, The Debatable Land: The Lost World Between Scotland and England, it is “probably the oldest national boundary in Europe”.
This man-made embankment, little of which is visible today, was a three-and-a-half-mile-long barrier that finally divided the Debatable Lands in two.

因为宜家是扁平包装家具的拥护者，自1953年推出其简单，稳定的圆形Delfi桌子以来，就一直如此。
其他希望将设计推向扁平化议程的企业包括瑞典制造商Hem，墨西哥的Luken和英国的Nomad。
同样，Nomad的原型海洋塑料椅子是从一张100％回收的海洋塑料中切出的。
而且，其生态证书-运输较小的箱子而不是笨重的现成物品可以减少碳足迹-使扁平包装的家具在当今尤其有吸引力。
如果良好的设计可以帮助自组装摆脱其劣质形象，那么未来将是平淡无奇的。

Because Ikea is the champion of flat-packed furniture, and has been ever since the launch of its simple, stable, circular Delfi table in 1953.
Other ventures hoping to push design up flat-packed agenda include Swedish manufacturer Hem, Mexico’s Luken, and Nomad in the UK.
Likewise, Nomad’s prototype Ocean Plastic Chair is cut out of a sheet of 100% recycled ocean plastic.
And its eco-credentials – transporting smaller boxes rather than bulky ready-built items results in a lower carbon footprint – makes flat-packed furniture particularly appealing these days.
If good design can help self-assembly shake off its shoddy image, then the future is flat-packed.

在瑞典企业家和环保主义者约翰内斯·沃特隆容·佩尔森（Johannes Wretljung Persson）参加的仅限男性参加的会议上，很少有话题是禁止的。
色情的影响，俱乐部的摸索和工作中的厌恶女性的取笑已经引起了广泛的争论。
活动范围从点燃烛光的晚宴到关于外卖炸玉米饼的辩论或在空办公室工作后的简单咖啡晚会。
其他人则作为非正式的支持会议，使男人专注于自己当前的关系和心理健康。
平等的女性联合创始人艾达·奥斯滕森（IdaÖstensson）在Facebook上发布消息称，男人应该考虑让自己的私人团体聚在一起讨论这个问题。

Few topics are off-limits at the male-only meetings attended by Swedish entrepreneur and environmentalist Johannes Wretljung Persson.
The impact of porn, groping in clubs and misogynist banter at work have already been widely debated.
Events have ranged from candle-lit dinner parties to debates over take-away tacos or simple coffee evenings after work in empty offices.
Others serve as more informal support sessions in which men focus on their own current relationships and mental health.
The female co-founder of Make Equal, Ida Östensson, posted on Facebook that men should consider getting their own private groups together to discuss the problem.

如您所料，给某人一个氧气罐来呼吸会逆转这些变化。
您不会期望的是，如果氧气罐是假的，那么您可以实现完全相同的目的–它是空的。
“血液中没有氧气，体内没有氧气，但是您可以获得与真实氧气完全相同的效果。
真正的答案是我们不清楚。
任何职业运动员都会告诉您，他们对获胜的信念在成功中扮演着重要的角色，研究表明，通过改变他们的期望，安慰剂效应可以对他们走多快或走多远产生强大影响。

As you might expect, giving someone an oxygen tank to breathe from will reverse these changes.
What you wouldn’t expect is that you can achieve exactly the same thing if the oxygen tank is a fake – it’s empty.
“There is no oxygen in the blood, there is no oxygen in the body, but you can get the very same effect as real oxygen.
The real answer is we don’t know.”Harder, faster, strongerWe normally hear about the placebo effect in a medical context.
Any professional athlete will tell you that their beliefs about winning play a huge role in success, and research suggests that by modifying their expectations, the placebo effect can have a powerful impact on how fast or how far they can go.

树木具有多种特性，可以帮助减少城市空气污染，世界各地的城市都在寻求利用它们。
同时，中国的河北省（北京的故乡）一直在研究植物的“绿色项链”，以帮助减少首都周边工厂的污染。
虽然树木通常可以有效减少空气污染，但它并不像您在城市空间中拥有的树木越多，空气越好。
为了最大程度地改善街道或城市的空气质量，必须选择合适的树。
树木可以直接或间接地改善空气质量。

Trees have a remarkable range of traits that can help reduce urban air pollution, and cities around the world are looking to harness them.
Meanwhile, China’s Hebei Province, home to Beijing, has been working on a “green necklace” of plants that could help reduce pollution from factories that surround the capital.
While trees are generally effective at reducing air pollution, it isn’t as simple as the more trees you have in an urban space, the better the air will be.
To make the most difference in air quality in a street or city, it has to be the right tree for the job.
Trees can improve air quality in direct and indirect ways.

自从您听到有人在争论“爱德华队”或“雅各队”以来，大概已经有一段时间了。
但是辩论可能会重新开始，因为《暮光之城》系列在最后一次装机十二年后才获得第四本书。
“我认为，作为粉丝，我们是在对原始系列的批评中成长的，我们对此都非常重视。
最初的书籍是从贝拉的角度讲的，而新的书籍从爱德华的角度重新审视了同样的事件。
达尼（Dani W）拥有自己的图书博客她说，听到发行一本新书是“超现实的”。

But the debate could be back on because the Twilight Series is getting a fourth book, 12 years after the last instalment.
"I think as fans we have grown up with the criticism of the original series and it's something we all take seriously.
The original books were told from Bella's perspective and the new one revisits the same events from Edward's point of view.
