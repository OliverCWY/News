The coronavirus has ostensibly put the world on hold. With stay-at-home orders in place, businesses closed, travel restricted and events scrapped, many of us are caught in limbo: the milestones we’ve been working toward – like university graduations or starting a new job – are suddenly postponed or cancelled altogether.

Thankfully, in most cases, these events haven’t fully vanished from our lives – instead, they’ve shifted from our immediate sight to the distant horizon. So, in a state of lockdown, maintaining a healthy mental and physical foundation to get to the finish line – whenever that’ll be – requires a special kind of grit and determination.

But how, exactly, are you supposed to stay game-ready when you’re stuck in isolation, separated from many of the people and resources you’re accustomed to? After all, you don’t know when you’re going to be called to rise to the challenge. And, in the interim, how do you cope with your lack of closure, and use the crisis as an opportunity to boost resilience and perform at your peak when the time comes?

So much for closure

Whether you’re looking ahead to a difficult school exam, a competition or a public speaking appointment, fretting about your performance is a natural symptom of ‘anticipatory emotions’.

These are feelings triggered by the anticipation of a future event that cause you to either take immediate pleasure in inevitable success, or, conversely, feel dread about impending failure, according to Chris Dawson, senior lecturer in business economics at the University of Bath. Balancing your expectations can be tricky, but in most cases, once the event has transpired, you can find at least partial relief in knowing the outcome.
