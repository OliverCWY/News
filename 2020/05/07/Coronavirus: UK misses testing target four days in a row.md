If you help someone during this pandemic, one day the favour might be returned.

That's what two Native American communities in the US have learned.

The Choctaw Nation sent $170 (around $5,000 in today's money) to Ireland in the 1840s when one million Irish people died during the potato famine. Their genorosity was sparked partly by the deaths of many Native Americans on the Trail of Tears, the forced displacement of 60,000 people.

Now the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Reservation are badly affected by the coronavirus, partly due to a lack of clean water, and Irish people are recognising the old kindness by donating $100,000 to a fundraiser.

One message, from Pat Hayes, read: “From Ireland, 170 years later, the favour is returned\! To our Native American brothers and sisters in your moment of hardship.”

The organisers of the fundraising wrote to praise the “acts of kindness from indigenous ancestors passed being reciprocated nearly 200 years later through blood memory and interconnectedness.”
