WASHINGTON - Every year, graduating international cadets at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) are honoured at the prestigious institution's graduation ceremony, where they get the chance to fly their country's flag.

Last month, Lieutenant Christabel Chai, 24, was one of them. Leaping onto her chair, she unfurled the Singapore flag and waved it with her arms spread wide, beaming with joy and pride in a photo that has gone viral on Facebook.
