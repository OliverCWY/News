（CNN）德国总理默克尔（Angela Merkel）周三制定了计划，在为阻止冠状病毒传播而实施的为期数周的限制之后，该国逐步重新开放。
人们仍然必须保持1.5米的距离，并在公共场合遮住嘴和鼻子。
默克尔在与德国16个州的总理举行视频会议后的新闻发布会上说，商店可以重新营业，但要采取其他卫生措施。
默克尔说，德国顶级足球联赛德甲也可以在5月下半月恢复比赛。
她没有说明这是陪同观众还是闭门造车。

(CNN) German Chancellor Angela Merkel set out plans Wednesday for the gradual reopening of the country after weeks-long restrictions imposed to stem the spread of the coronavirus.
People must still remain 1.5 meters apart and cover their mouths and noses in public.
Shops can reopen but with additional hygiene measures, Merkel said, speaking at a news conference following a video meeting with the prime ministers of Germany's 16 states.
Germany's top football league, the Bundesliga, can also resume play in the second half of May, Merkel said.
She did not specify if this would be with spectators or behind closed doors.

（CNN）据该大学称，匹兹堡大学的一位教授即将对“ Covid-19”进行研究的“非常重大的发现”即将在周末被枪杀。
罗斯警察局称，研究助理教授刘冰被发现于周六的联排别墅内，头部，颈部，躯干和四肢都有枪伤。
调查人员相信，一名身份不明的第二人被发现死于车内，在回到家中自杀前自杀并在家中枪杀了刘。
侦探警官说，警方相信两人是彼此了解的，但说“没有迹象表明，由于他的（刘）是中国人，所以有针对性。”
该大学发表声明说，“对于多产的研究人员和匹兹堡令人敬佩的同事刘冰的不幸去世深感悲痛。

(CNN) A University of Pittsburgh professor on the verge of making "very significant findings" researching Covid-19, according to the university, was shot and killed in an apparent murder-suicide over the weekend, police said.
The research assistant professor, identified as Bing Liu, was found in his townhouse Saturday with gunshot wounds to the head, neck, torso and extremities, according to the Ross Police Department.
Investigators believe an unidentified second man, who was found dead in his car, shot and killed Liu in his home before returning to his car and taking his own life.
Police believe the men knew each other, but say there is "zero indication that there was targeting due to his (Liu) being Chinese," according to Detective Sgt.
The university issued a statement saying it is "deeply saddened by the tragic death of Bing Liu, a prolific researcher and admired colleague at Pitt.

然后在星期二晚些时候，在亚利桑那州，唐纳德·特朗普总统被问及特遣部队的关闭计划。
“这个国家开始开放，特别工作组做得很出色。”
“由于这项成功，工作队将无限期地继续致力于安全和再次开放我们的国家。
该工作队还将非常关注疫苗和治疗学。
特朗普在3月23日发推文说：“我们不能让解决问题的方法更胜一筹。”

Then later Tuesday, in Arizona, President Donald Trump was asked about the planned shuttering of the task force.
"The country is starting to open up, the task force has done a phenomenal job."
"Because of this success, the Task Force will continue on indefinitely with its focus on SAFETY & OPENING UP OUR COUNTRY AGAIN.
The Task Force will also be very focused on Vaccines & Therapeutics.
"WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF," Trump tweeted way back on March 23 .

（CNN）三名美国海军陆战队队员介入拘留一名据称在从日本飞往德克萨斯州的航班上发表威胁性言论的乘客。
迪特里克说，即使他戴着耳机，他也能听到浴室里有人听起来“心烦”。
根据新闻稿，那是三名海军陆战队员聚集在洗手间外面，而空姐则将门解锁。
一旦打开，海军陆战队就用束缚带约束了乘客。
“在接下来的飞行中，我没有三思而后行地帮助克制他。”

(CNN) Three US Marines stepped in to detain a passenger who allegedly made threatening comments during a flight from Japan to Texas.
Dietrick said that even through the headphones he was wearing he could hear someone inside the bathroom who sounded "distraught."
That's when the three Marines gathered outside the restroom while a flight attendant unlocked the door, according to the release.
Once it was open, the Marines restrained the passenger with flex ties.
"I didn't think twice about helping restrain him through the rest of the flight."

在那儿，他看着病人进入血液急诊室时血氧水平低至50％，因此，他们本应语无伦次，甚至失去知觉。
正常的血氧饱和度在95％至100％之间，任何低于90％的血氧饱和度都被视为异常。
人们可能不知道自己的呼吸加快，也没有寻求帮助，但血氧水平持续下降。
快速发展为呼吸衰竭的无声缺氧可能解释了为什么一些没有潜在健康状况的年轻Covid-19患者在未经历任何严重的呼吸急促后突然死亡。
然而，关于家用脉搏血氧仪测量血氧水平的优缺点仍然存在疑问。

There he watched patients come into the emergency room with blood oxygen levels as low as 50%, so low they should have been incoherent, even unconscious.
Normal blood oxygen saturation is between 95% and 100%, and anything below 90% is considered abnormal.
People may not be aware of their more rapid breathing rate and don't seek help, yet blood oxygen levels continue to fall.
A silent hypoxia that progresses rapidly to respiratory failure may explain why some younger Covid-19 patients with no underlying health conditions have died suddenly after not experiencing any serious shortness of breath.
However, questions remain about the merits of home use of pulse oximeters to measure blood oxygen levels.

最高法院周三下午创造了历史，由于Covid-19的原因在电话中进行了辩论，突然之间突然听到厕所冲水的声音。
司法，律师和国家正在处理通过电话会议线路开展业务的新现实和新危险，这是来自未知来源的错误冲刺。
该案涉及《电话消费者保护法》，该法禁止使用自动化系统对手机进行不必要的通话。
挑战者说，一项规定违反了宪法。
当冒犯性的同花顺发生时，代表政治团体挑战的律师罗曼·马丁内斯（Roman Martinez）提出了自己的观点。

The Supreme Court was making history Wednesday afternoon, holding arguments over the phone because of Covid-19, when all of a sudden there was the distinct sound of a toilet flushing.
The errant flush from an unknown source comes as the justices, lawyers and the country are dealing with the new realities -- and hazards -- of conducting their business over teleconference lines.
The case at issue concerned the Telephone Consumer Protection Act that prohibits unwanted calls to cellphones by use of an automated system.
Challengers say one provision violates the Constitution.
Lawyer Roman Martinez, representing political groups challenging the law, was pressing his point when the offending flush occurred.

（CNN）未成年人棒球运动员布雷克·比文斯（Blake Bivens）表示，他去年在Facebook上阅读新闻时得知自己的妻子，年幼的儿子和岳母被杀。
这位24岁的投手与弗吉尼亚州丹维尔市河教堂的牧师特拉维斯·戈尔（Travis Gore）分享了故事，星期三进行了现场直播采访，距三人杀人事件已经过去八个月了。
他检查了手机，没有看到妻子的消息，便决定检查Facebook。
“当我点击Facebook时，我只是看到一个标题，而该标题只是他们正在寻找我的姐夫。
因此，我知道随后会发生什么事，所以我立即打电话给我的父母，”比文斯说。

(CNN) Minor League Baseball player Blake Bivens says he learned his wife, young son and mother-in-law had been killed when he read the news on Facebook last year.
The 24-year-old pitcher shared the story with Pastor Travis Gore from the River Church in Danville, Virginia, in a livestreamed interview Sunday, eight months after the triple homicide.
He checked his phone and, seeing no messages from his wife, decided to check Facebook.
"As soon as I clicked on Facebook, I just saw a headline, and the headline was just (that) they were looking for my brother-in-law.
And so I knew then there's something going on, so I immediately called my parents," Bivens said.

## 生命学院提出：思考死亡的另一种方式

### The School of Life presents: Another way to think about death

这篇文章是由生命学院与美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）合作发表的，这是关于在冠状病毒大流行期间更富于哲学生活的系列的一部分。
荷兰17世纪哲学家Baruch Spinoza在看待死亡的两种方式之间做出了著名的区分。
一个人可以想象地与瞬变或自然事物融为一体：树木，风，蛾，海岸上折腾的云层或波浪。
从这个角度来看，地位不重要，财产无关紧要，抱怨不紧迫-不再存在并不意味着灾难。
如果某些人此时会遇到我们，他们可能会对我们新发现的慷慨和安宁感到惊讶。

The article is by The School of Life, in partnership with CNN, as part of a series on living more philosophically during the coronavirus pandemic.
The Dutch seventeenth century philosopher Baruch Spinoza made a famous distinction between two ways of looking at death.
One's can imaginatively fuse with transient or natural things: trees, the wind, a moth, clouds or waves breaking on the shore.
From this point of view, status is nothing, possessions don't matter, grievances lose their urgency -- and not being around any more doesn't have to be a disaster.
If certain people could encounter us at this point, they might be amazed at our our newfound generosity and tranquillity.

The meditation practice yoga nidra in savasana pose , or deep relaxation techniques, helped to relax the body toward the end of the practice.
Further studies with follow-ups, different locations and yoga practice without medication are needed to determine the long-term benefits of yoga for migraine relief.
But integrating yoga into treatment would help patients and their doctors move toward overall wellness rather than just curing the pain, Sharma said.

The building will also feature one of the world's tallest ceramic facades composed of clay-based materials, with an overlaid lacework of fin-shaped tiles.

The tower design was inspired by the asymmetrical, "contrapposto" pose commonly used in classical sculpture.

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
这次空袭后来估计是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

但是，美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）采访了包括帕特里夏（Patricia）在内的五名十几岁左右的女性，他们声称格拉泽（Glaser）在Bery's Place对其进行了性和情感虐待。
当女孩们反对时，他们说格拉泽会威胁要把他们赶出去。
一些幸存者说，格拉瑟（Glaser）介绍自己是一名医生，但是支持检方的律师告诉CNN，他是物理治疗师-不是合格的医生。
Dilen去年2月在Bery's Place进行的一次警察突袭中被警察盘问而被捕，随后被释放。
但至少现在，他们说，他们开始在贝里故居之外享受生活。

But five women in their late teens and early twenties interviewed by CNN, including Patricia, allege that Glaser sexually and emotionally abused them at Bery's Place.
When the girls objected, they say Glaser would threaten to cast them out on the streets.
Some survivors say Glaser introduced himself as a doctor, but lawyers supporting the prosecution told CNN that he is a physiotherapist -- not a qualified physician.
Dilen was arrested for questioning by police last February during a police raid at Bery's Place, and later released.
But for now, at least, they say they're beginning to enjoy their lives outside of Bery's Place.
