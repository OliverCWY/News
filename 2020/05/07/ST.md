北京（彭博社）-中国向美国国务卿迈克尔·蓬佩奥（Michael Pompeo）回击，称他没有证据支持导致Covid-19病毒从中心城市武汉的实验室逃脱的说法。
华女士在北京的例行通报会上说：“庞培先生无法提供任何证据，因为他没有任何证据。”
庞培先生周日声称，有“大量证据”表明该病毒是在第一次已知爆发附近从高安全性病毒学实验室逃脱的。
华女士说，中国将支持在适当的时候对病毒的起源进行审查。
华女士在星期三花了整整一个小时的情况介绍，为中国抵御美国的袭击辩护，并叙述了与其他国家和世界卫生组织合作的努力。

BEIJING (BLOOMBERG) - China fired back at US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, saying he has no evidence to back up claims that the virus that causes Covid-19 escaped from a lab in the central city of Wuhan.
"Mr Pompeo cannot present any evidence because he does not have any," Ms Hua told a regular briefing in Beijing.
Mr Pompeo on Sunday claimed that there was "enormous evidence" that the virus escaped from the high-security virology laboratory near the first known outbreak.
Ms Hua said China would support a review about the origins of the virus at an "appropriate time".
Ms Hua spent much of the hour-long briefing on Wednesday defending China against US attacks and recounting its efforts to cooperate with other countries and the WHO.
