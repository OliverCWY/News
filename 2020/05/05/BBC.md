美国已表示，由于与冠状病毒相关的救援计划炸毁了预算，美国希望在第二季度借入创纪录的30亿美元（2.4亿英镑）。
这个数字是2008年金融危机最严重时的上一个季度记录的五倍多。
美国已经批准了大约3tn亿美元的与病毒有关的救济措施，其中包括卫生基金和直接支出。
新的借款估算比政​​府先前的估算高出3 tnt，这表明了新计划的影响。
但是甚至在冠状病毒爆发之前，该国的债务负担就一直攀升至许多经济学家认为长期增长有风险的水平，因为该国的支出超过了收入。

The sum is more than five times the previous quarterly record, set at the height of the 2008 financial crisis.
The US has approved about $3tn in virus-related relief, including health funding and direct payouts.
The new borrowing estimate is more than $3tn above the government's previous estimate, a sign of the impact of the new programmes.
But even before the coronavirus, the country's debt load had been climbing toward levels many economists consider risky for long-term growth, as the country spent more than it took in.

欧盟委员会承诺提供10亿美元，用于疫苗研究。
她说：“我相信5月4日将标志着我们与冠状病毒斗争的转折点，因为今天世界正在聚在一起。”
约翰逊先生与Covid-19一起在重症监护室度过了三个晚上，他将在会议期间确认英国承诺提供3.88亿英镑用于疫苗研究，测试和治疗。
他们补充说：“如果我们能够开发出全世界生产的疫苗，那么这将是21世纪独特的全球公共利益。”
目前世界各地正在进行数十种试图寻找疫苗的研究项目。

The European Commission pledged $1bn to fund research on a vaccine.
"I believe 4 May will mark a turning point in our fight against coronavirus because today the world is coming together," she said.
Mr Johnson, who spent three nights in intensive care with Covid-19, was to confirm the UK's pledge of £388m for vaccine research, testing and treatment during the conference.
"If we can develop a vaccine that is produced by the world, for the whole world, this will be a unique global public good of the 21st Century," they added.
Dozens of research projects trying to find a vaccine are currently under way across the world.

去年秋天，亚洲大黄蜂首次在美国被发现。即使美国仍然受到冠状病毒爆发的袭击，一种新的恐怖已经到来：“谋杀大黄蜂”。
WSU科学家和入侵物种专家Todd Murray说，杀人大黄蜂可以在数小时内摧毁一个蜂箱。大黄蜂“惊人地大”。
尽管蜂箱是他们的主要目标，但当蜂箱受到威胁时，蜂箱可能会袭击人类。
在最常见的日本，凶杀黄蜂每年大约杀死30至40人。
黄蜂可能会在多次刺伤后杀死人类。WSU科学家将于今年春季开始诱捕女王杀害大黄蜂，旨在发现并消灭该物种。

## 英格兰和苏格兰之间的小“国家”

我坚定地抵御微风，站在苏格兰和英国边界西南端的标志处调查现场。
人们认为，可争议土地是英国最后的大领土分区。
苏格兰和英格兰之间的界线是根据1237年的《约克条约》建立的。
正如格雷厄姆·罗伯（Graham Robb）在他2018年的书《有争议的土地：苏格兰和英格兰之间的失落世界》中所写的那样，它“可能是欧洲最古老的国界”。
这座人造堤防，今天几乎看不到，是一个三英里半长的屏障，最终将可耕地分成两部分。

Standing firm against a determined breeze, I was surveying the scene from what marks the south-western end of the border between Scotland and England.
The Debatable Lands is believed to have been the last great territorial division in Britain.
The line between Scotland and England was established with the Treaty of York in 1237.
As Graham Robb writes in his 2018 book, The Debatable Land: The Lost World Between Scotland and England, it is “probably the oldest national boundary in Europe”.
This man-made embankment, little of which is visible today, was a three-and-a-half-mile-long barrier that finally divided the Debatable Lands in two.

如您所料，给某人一个氧气罐来呼吸会逆转这些变化。
您不会期望的是，如果氧气罐是假的，那么您可以实现完全相同的目的–它是空的。
“血液中没有氧气，体内没有氧气，但是您可以获得与真实氧气完全相同的效果。
真正的答案是我们不清楚。
任何职业运动员都会告诉您，他们对获胜的信念在成功中扮演着重要的角色，研究表明，通过改变他们的期望，安慰剂效应可以对他们走多快或走多远产生强大影响。

As you might expect, giving someone an oxygen tank to breathe from will reverse these changes.
What you wouldn’t expect is that you can achieve exactly the same thing if the oxygen tank is a fake – it’s empty.
“There is no oxygen in the blood, there is no oxygen in the body, but you can get the very same effect as real oxygen.
The real answer is we don’t know.”Harder, faster, strongerWe normally hear about the placebo effect in a medical context.
Any professional athlete will tell you that their beliefs about winning play a huge role in success, and research suggests that by modifying their expectations, the placebo effect can have a powerful impact on how fast or how far they can go.

Dr Yves Cohen told French media a swab taken at the time was recently tested, and came back positive for Covid-19.
This news means the virus may have arrived in France almost a month earlier than previously thought.

由于裁员计划，通用电气公司将裁减多达四分之一的航空业务人员，原因是冠状病毒大流行导致航空旅行需求下降。
该公司已经宣布将其美国航空人员削减10％，但表示“还需要更多”。
这些计划是航空旅行业正在为长期旅行减速做准备的最新迹象。
它们是更广泛的30亿美元（24亿英镑）成本节省计划的一部分，因为该行业警告称，本季度全球航空旅行将减少80％。
GE航空总裁戴维·乔伊斯（David Joyce）在给员工的一封信中说：“随着这种流行病的继续发展，我们对其流行病对我们行业和业务的影响的理解也在发展。”

The plans are the latest sign that the air travel industry is preparing for a prolonged travel slowdown.
They are part of a wider $3bn (£2,4bn) cost-saving effort, as the industry warns of an 80% drop in global air travel this quarter.
"As this pandemic continues to advance, our understanding of its impact on our industry and our business has also evolved," GE Aviation President David Joyce said in a message to staff.

根据一项旨在帮助人们因冠状病毒大流行而请假的新计划，英国政府目前正在为英国近四分之一的工作支付工资。
上周约有250万人注册了该计划，使总索偿额达到630万，占在职员工的23％。
就业保留计划为工人工资的80％提供资金，每月最高2500英镑。
该公司表示，迄今为止已分配了80亿英镑，平均派息为1,269英镑，约为最高2500英镑的一半。
该计划将持续到6月，这表明总成本可能超过300亿英镑。

About 2.5 million people registered last week for the scheme, bringing the total claims to 6.3 million - 23% of the employed workforce.
The job retention scheme funds 80% of workers' wages, up to £2,500 a month.
It said it had distributed £8bn so far, with an average payout of £1,269 - about half of the £2,500 maximum.
The scheme is due to run through June, suggesting the total cost could exceed £30bn.

But where did the industry of Thighmaster and Wii Fit come from – and where’s it heading after the pandemic?
But ‘fitness’ as we know it today is a relatively new construct, not even 200 years old.

这只是《帝国反击》要求我们假装没有发生《星球大战》的众多案例中的第一个。
算了吧-因为在《帝国反击战》中，我们被告知皇帝本人也致力于同一宗教。
尽管有《帝国反击战》的称号，但它很少涉及联盟v帝国，而是关于谁与谁有关系以及谁爱上谁（两者有时会重叠）。
抱歉，《帝国反击战》必须归咎于所有人。

What’s more, it seems obvious that The Empire Strikes Back is the source of all the franchise’s problems.
And it’s just the first of many instances when The Empire Strikes Back asks us to pretend that Star Wars didn’t happen.
Forget it – because in The Empire Strikes Back we’re told that the Emperor himself is devoted to the same religion.
Despite its title, The Empire Strikes Back is rarely about the Alliance v the Empire, it’s about who is related to whom and who is in love with whom (the two sometimes overlap).
I’m sorry, but The Empire Strikes Back has to take the blame for all of them.

高压锅内积聚的蒸汽将压力提高到正常大气压力的两倍，因此液体的温度可能会升高到水的沸点（100C / 212F）以上。
高压锅可节省90％的能量，将锅上的锅煮沸。
有些食物非常适合在这种炎热和潮湿的条件下烹饪：例如，肉汤充分利用了高压锅的所有优点。
密封的压力锅消除了对水的注水的需要。
“我下班回家时，只是把所有食材都塞进了压力锅。

The steam trapped inside the pressure cooker builds up pressure to twice that of our normal atmosphere, so the temperature of the liquid can rise above the boiling point of water (100C/212F).
A pressure cooker saves 90 percent of the energy used to boil a pot on the hob.
Some foods are perfect to cook under these hot and steamy conditions: a meat stock, for instance, takes advantage of all the pressure cooker’s benefits.
And the sealed pressure cooker eliminates the need for topping up the water.
“I just bung all the ingredients in a pressure cooker when I get home from work.

社交媒体巨头表示，与另一个人相比，有49％的人更喜欢与聊天机器人进行交互。
但是专家说，使用Reddit这样的平台训练人工智能（AI）有其缺点。
“这是第一个在一个系统中将多种会话技巧融合在一起的聊天机器人。”
