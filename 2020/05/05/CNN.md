（CNN）白宫经常引用的一种有影响力的冠状病毒模型现在预测，美国将有134,000人死于Covid-19，几乎是先前预测的两倍。
IHME主任克里斯托弗·默里（Christopher Murray）博士告诉美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）的沃尔夫·布雷泽（Wolf Blitzer），其他因素包括各州在其统计数据中增加了推测性冠状病毒死亡，以及该国一些肉类包装厂的病例增加。
芝加哥市有1000人死亡芝加哥市长洛里·莱特富特（Lori Lightfoot）说，芝加哥是美国第三大人口最多的城市，有270万居民，已经达到1000人死亡的“悲伤里程碑”。
在两个月内，芝加哥市死于冠状病毒的人数现在已经比2019年全市的凶杀案数量增加了一倍以上。
为了解决这个问题，纽约市市长比尔·德布拉西奥（Bill de Blasio）周一星期一宣布，纽约市将在该市各地分发750万份面罩。

(CNN) An influential coronavirus model often cited by the White House is now forecasting that 134,000 people will die of Covid-19 in the United States, nearly double its previous prediction.
IHME director Dr. Christopher Murray told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that other factors included states adding presumptive coronavirus deaths to their statistics and the rising number of cases in some meatpacking plants in the country.
Chicago reaches 1,000 deathsChicago, the nation's third most-populous city with 2.7 million residents, has reached the "sad milestone" of 1,000 coronavirus deaths, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said.
In two months, the number of coronavirus deaths in the city of Chicago has now more than doubled the amount of homicides in the city in 2019.
To solve that, New York City is distributing 7.5 million face coverings at various locations around the city, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Monday morning.

（CNN）有新证据表明，冠状病毒可能比以前想象的早了几周。
巴黎一家医院的医生说，他们发现了证据，表明12月份收治的一名患者感染了Covid-19。
如果得到证实，这一发现将表明该病毒当时已在欧洲传播-早在法国或意大利热点地区诊断出第一个已知病例之前。
1月24日，法国发生了Covid-19的首次正式报道，当时有两名曾到中国武汉旅行的人。
重症监护专家伊夫·科恩（Yves Cohen）博士和他的医院同事写道，他们决定检查早期患者的记录，以防病毒未被发现传播。

(CNN) There's new evidence that the coronavirus may have been in France weeks earlier than was previously thought.
Doctors at a Paris hospital say they've found evidence that one patient admitted in December was infected with Covid-19.
If verified, this finding would show that the virus was already circulating in Europe at that time -- well before the first known cases were diagnosed in France or hotspot Italy.
The first official reports of Covid-19 in France were reported on Jan. 24, in two people who had a history of travel to Wuhan, China.
Intensive care specialist Dr. Yves Cohen and his hospital colleagues wrote that they decided to check the records of earlier patients, in case the virus had been spreading undetected.

（CNN）Vel Records首席执行官加缪·塞利（Camus Celli）对CNN说，流行和乡村歌手兼词曲作者卡迪·格罗夫斯（Cady Groves）上周末在田纳西州的家中去世。
死因裁判官排除了犯规和自残行为。”
她的唱片公司称，格罗夫斯来自堪萨斯州，刚刚包装了她即将发行的2020年专辑，该专辑定于今年夏天发行。
她的一些最受欢迎的歌曲包括“这个小女孩”，“实际上是爱”和“忘记了你”。
格罗夫斯与LMFAO，Good Charlotte和Third Eye Blind一起巡回演出，并继续在纳什维尔为歌迷表演。

Foul play and self-harm have both been ruled out by the coroner," Celli said in a statement on Monday.
Groves, originally from Kansas, had just wrapped her upcoming 2020 album which was set to be due out this summer, according to her label.
Some of her most popular songs include "This Little Girl," "Love Actually" and "Forget You."

但是什么时候可以使用Covid-19疫苗？
4月30日，世界卫生组织发布了Covid-19疫苗计划的最新清单。
这些人群受益于疫苗开发领域的丰富经验。
因此，一些专家担心，如果Covid-19疫苗发挥作用会激发免疫系统，则当暴露于实际病毒中时，人体可能会遭受破坏性的超速行驶。
因为在大流行期间唯一比没有疫苗更糟糕的事情是使事情变得更糟的疫苗。

But when will a Covid-19 vaccine be available?
On April 30, the World Health Organization posted an up-to-date inventory of Covid-19 vaccine initiatives.
These groups have benefited from extensive experience in the field of vaccine development.
Thus some experts fear that if a Covid-19 vaccine does its job provoking the immune system, the body could go into a destructive overdrive when exposed to the actual virus.
Because the only thing worse than no vaccine during a pandemic is a vaccine that makes matters worse.

沃特福德消防局局长唐纳德·鲍德温（Donald Baldwin）表示，最初疏散了七个房屋。
鲍德温说，随着地面的不断滑动，工程师正在监视局势。
鲍德温告诉美国有线电视新闻网：“滑坡的面积约为150-200英尺。”

(CNN) A landslide left a dozen people displaced after their homes came dangerously close to being destroyed.
Pictures of the scene on Sunday in Waterford, New York, show one home dangling off the edge of a cliff and other homes mere feet away.
Initially, seven homes were evacuated, according to Waterford Fire Chief Donald Baldwin.
Engineers are monitoring the situation as the ground continues to slide, according to Baldwin.
"The area of the landslide was about 150-200 feet," Baldwin told CNN.

Kent State is commemorating the event with a virtual program that includes a candlelight vigil, a radio play, interactive apps that allow users to explore the events surrounding the shooting and video interviews with Kent State students.
Fearing further disruptions, the mayor asked Ohio's governor the next day to send the state national guard to Kent.

（CNN）-在西班牙西北部国家公园工作的电影摄制组拍摄了据信在150年来在该地区见过的第一只棕熊的镜头。
声明说，自1973年以来，棕熊就一直是西班牙的一种受保护物种，虽然间歇性地生活在加利西亚地区，但从历史上讲，它一直是已知的。
据信，这是150年来首次在加利西亚南部与葡萄牙接壤的这一地区发现棕熊。
他们补充说，这意味着该公园将来将能够支持其他熊种群。
声明说：“经过多年的保护工作，O Invernadeiro保护区已成为棕熊的合适栖息地。”

(CNN) — A film crew working in a national park in northwestern Spain has captured footage of the first brown bear believed to have been seen in the local area in 150 years.
Brown bears have been a protected species in Spain since 1973 and have historically been known to live in the region of Galicia, albeit intermittently, according to the statement.
It is believed to be the first time in 150 years that a brown bear has been seen in this part of southern Galicia, near the border with Portugal.
This means the park will be able to support other bear populations in the future, they added.
"After years of conservation work the O Invernadeiro protected area has become a suitable habitat for brown bears," reads the statement.

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议厅”轰炸而丧生。
后来空袭被认为是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

但是，美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）采访了包括帕特里夏（Patricia）在内的五名十几岁和二十多岁的女性，他们声称格拉瑟（Glaser）在Bery's Place对其进行了性和情感虐待。
当女孩们反对时，他们说格拉泽会威胁要把他们赶出去。
一些幸存者说，格拉瑟（Glaser）介绍自己是一名医生，但支持起诉的律师告诉美国有线电视新闻网（CNN），他是物理治疗师-不是合格的医生。
Dilen于去年2月在Bery's Place进行的一次警察突袭中因警察的讯问而被捕，后来被释放。
但至少现在，他们说他们开始在贝里故居之外享受生活。

But five women in their late teens and early twenties interviewed by CNN, including Patricia, allege that Glaser sexually and emotionally abused them at Bery's Place.
When the girls objected, they say Glaser would threaten to cast them out on the streets.
Some survivors say Glaser introduced himself as a doctor, but lawyers supporting the prosecution told CNN that he is a physiotherapist -- not a qualified physician.
Dilen was arrested for questioning by police last February during a police raid at Bery's Place, and later released.
But for now, at least, they say they're beginning to enjoy their lives outside of Bery's Place.
