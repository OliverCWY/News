Three simple tips to improve your memory

For memories to form, three functions have to take place. Acquiring - learning or experiencing something new. Consolidating - this is where the memories become stable. And finally, recall, the ability to recall that information in the future. Caption: 3 tips to improve your memory Caption: Acquire Learn a new skill Can juggling really increase brain activity? German researchers divided 24 non-jugglers into two groups and asked one group to practise juggling for three months. They found that those who didn’t juggle showed no difference in brain activity over the test period. But those who juggled, had an increase in grey matter in two areas of the hippocampus and neocortex, parts of the brain involved in memory, visual and motor activity. The brain is like a muscle and needs exercise. To exercise your memory you don’t necessarily have to learn a new physical skill like juggling. (In Spanish) It can be anything from learning a new language to skilling up in a computer game. Caption: Consolidate Enter your memory palace A memory palace is where you imagine a place where you can store information. Memory experts use this trick a lot to remember number sequences or even a whole deck of cards. Let's say you have a simple list of things you want to buy. Step one: Start at your door and go anticlockwise around your room, labelling each item one to seven in order. Step two: In my room, my bed is the first object. So I would place the first item I want to remember buying an apple, for example on my bed. Step three: Create a visual image and exaggerate it in some way to make it more memorable. If the first item is an apple, picture a big purple apple crushing your bed. Repeat the process until every piece of information is associated to an item in your memory palace. Caption: Recall Keep a note of your dreams During sleep, your body rests, although your brain is busily processing information from the day to form memories. People who recall their dreams improve their memory and are more creative. Try keeping a dream diary of some sort. Just a notebook and pen, so you can write down or sketch as much as you can remember as soon as you wake up. So there you have it. Acquiring, consolidating, and finally recall. Simple tips to improve your memory.
