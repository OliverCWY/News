柏林（路透社）-两位知情人士周一在接受路透社采访时表示，德国国家总理将在定于周三（5月6日）与总理安格拉•默克尔（Angela Merkel）举行的电话会议中商定进一步缓解冠状病毒限制的措施。
消息人士称，预计首相将为大型商店重新开业开绿灯，大概从5月11日开始。
消息人士称，德国各州也将允许德甲足球联盟在严格的条件下，从5月15日起恢复比赛，而在没有球迷的情况下。
同时，州总理将允许非专业人士和儿童进行户外运动。
德国在减缓病毒传播方面比欧洲其他大国更成功-据估计，现在，该病毒的每100个携带者平均仅感染74个其他携带者，远低于必须施加新限制的100个标记。

BERLIN (REUTERS) - Germany's state premiers will agree on measures to further ease coronavirus restrictions in a teleconference with Chancellor Angela Merkel scheduled for Wednesday (May 6), two people familiar with the preparations told Reuters on Monday.
The state premiers are expected to give the green light for large shops to reopen, probably from May 11, the sources said.
German states are also set to allow the Bundesliga soccer league to resume matches, probably from May 15, under strict conditions without fans in stadiums, the sources said.
At the same time, state premiers will allow outdoor sports for non-professionals and children, the sources added.
Germany has been more successful than other large European countries in slowing the virus' spread - it estimates that every 100 carriers of the virus now infects only 74 others on average, well below the 100 mark where new restrictions must be imposed.

日本首相安倍晋三周一表示，日本有关冠状病毒的紧急状态令定于周三（5月6日）到期，将延长至5月31日。
安倍晋三表示，最早在5月14日，有可能部分解除紧急声明，届时专家组将召集审查情况。
安倍晋三对继续采取紧急措施的“痛苦决定”表示歉意，他指出小型企业的困境，并承诺迅速提供200万日元（26,540新元）的现金援助，以帮助他们度过难关。
由于宪法对自由的保障，日本的紧急状态所受的限制比许多其他国家要少得多。

TOKYO - Japan's state of emergency decree over the coronavirus, which was set to expire on Wednesday (May 6), will be extended until May 31, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Monday.
A partial lifting of the emergency declaration may be possible as soon as May 14, Mr Abe said, when an expert panel will convene to review the situation.
Mr Abe apologised for the “heart-wrenching” decision to continue emergency measures, noting the hardships of small businesses and promising prompt cash handouts of two million yen (S$26,540) each to help tide them over.
Due to constitutional guarantees of freedom, Japan’s state of emergency has been much less restrictive than in many other countries.

周一（5月4日），住在宿舍的外国工人占573例新的冠状病毒病例中的560例。
卫生部（MOH）在每日更新中说，在其他新的社区病例中，有五人是新加坡人和永久居民。
这使新加坡的冠状病毒病例总数达到18,778。
该部还提供了来自公共卫生部门的三例冠状病毒病例的最新情况。
为了做到这一点，社区案件必须保持较低水平或进一步下降，而移徙工人宿舍中的案件则需要“受到明显控制”。

SINGAPORE - Foreign workers living in dormitories made up 560 of the 573 new coronavirus cases on Monday (May 4).
Among the other new community cases, five were Singaporeans and permanent residents, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update.
This brings the total number of coronavirus cases in Singapore to 18,778.
The ministry also gave updates on three coronavirus cases from the public healthcare sector.
For this to happen, community cases would have to remain low or drop further, while cases in migrant worker dormitories would need to come “clearly under control”.

特朗普在周日晚（5月3日）接受福克斯新闻采访时说：“我认为他们犯了一个非常可怕的错误。”
当被问及习近平时，特朗普回答说：“我什么也不会说。”
特朗普先生及其助手上周加强了对北京的批评，要求就该病毒的起源做出答复。
庞培在美国广播公司（ABC）上说：“中国表现得像威权政权一样，试图掩饰，掩饰和混淆。”
庞培说：“这是一个持续的威胁，一个持续的大流行。”

"I think they made a very horrible mistake," Mr Trump said during an interview Sunday night (May 3) on Fox News.
"I'm not going to say anything," Mr Trump responded when asked about Mr Xi.
Mr Trump and his aides sharpened their criticism of Beijing last week, demanding answers about the virus' origin.
"China behaved like authoritarian regimes do, attempted to conceal and hide and confuse," Mr Pompeo said on ABC.
"This is an ongoing threat, an ongoing pandemic," Mr Pompeo said.
