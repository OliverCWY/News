最高裁定协议消息人士称，丹斯里·穆希丁（Tan Sri Muhyiddin）在伯萨图（Bersatu）的派系正在推动正式确定12个政党的PN联盟。
Covid-19大流行迫使两个月的全国限制使穆希丁（Muhyiddin）的政府受阻，但也为新的马来西亚领导人赢得了时间。
Bersatu最近几周公开游说在穆希丁（Muhyiddin）的故乡柔佛州（Johor）进行更多政治任命，因为他已将menteri besar职位移交给了巫统（Umno）。
最高理事会成员万赛义·万扬（Wan Saiful Wan Jan）告诉ST：“巫统一直呼吁马来统一，而PN将所有马来政党召集在一起，那为什么要破裂呢？”
但是拿督贾兹兰的主张反映了让一个代表联盟的代表马来穆斯林的三个政党的领导人感到高兴的困难。

Top ruling pact sources said that Tan Sri Muhyiddin's faction in Bersatu is pushing to formalise the PN alliance of 12 parties.
The Covid-19 pandemic has forced two months of nationwide restrictions that have obstructed Mr Muhyiddin's government, but also bought the new Malaysian leader time.
Bersatu has openly lobbied in recent weeks for more political appointments in Mr Muhyiddin's home state of Johor, having surrendered the menteri besar position to Umno.
Supreme council member Wan Saiful Wan Jan told ST: "Umno has long called for Malay unity and PN brings all the Malay parties together, so why break it up?"
But Datuk Jazlan's assertion reflects the difficulty of keeping leaders of three parties representing Malay Muslims in one coalition happy.

香港-在全球最昂贵，最具韧性的房地产市场中，房主很快就会受到喘息的冠状病毒大流行的拖累。
一些市场观察人士预计，自2019年下半年抗议活动袭击香港以来，私人住房价格一直在下滑。由于大流行和遏制措施严重影响了国内和全球经济，今年私人住房价格将进一步下跌。
该数据与香港政府宣布从5月27日起分阶段重新开放学校的时间相吻合。

HONG KONG - Home owners in the world's most expensive and resilient property market will have no respite any time soon, dragged down by an unyielding coronavirus pandemic.
Some market observers are expecting private housing prices, which have been sliding since protests hit Hong Kong in the later half of 2019, to fall further this year as the pandemic and containment measures weigh heavy on the domestic and global economy.
The data coincided with an announcement by the Hong Kong government that schools would be reopened in phases from May 27.

为了拯救饥饿的动物免于被杀死和互相喂食，印度尼西亚动物园协会开始了筹款活动，因为冠状病毒大流行给动物园的库房造成了损失。
拉赫马特博士说：“动物园可能是封闭的，但仍然需要喂养和照顾动物，并清理笼子。”
“我们的首要任务是保持动物的健康，照顾动物的福利，并确保它们的保养和维护能够正常进行。”
上周六（5月2日）启动了名为“动物粮”的筹款活动，这是该协会确保动物生存的最新尝试。
目前，Rahmat博士以及接受采访的动物团体只是希望冠状病毒大流行结束。

In a desperate bid to save hungry animals from being killed and fed to one another, the Indonesian Zoo Association has kicked off a fund-raising drive as the coronavirus pandemic takes a toll on zoo coffers.
"The zoos may be closed, but the animals still need to be fed and cared for, and their cages cleaned," said Dr Rahmat.
"Our priority is to keep the animals healthy, look after their welfare and make sure their care and maintenance can run normally."
The fund-raising drive, called Food For Animals, launched last Saturday (May 2), was the association's latest attempt to ensure the animal's survival.
For now, Dr Rahmat as well as animal groups interviewed are only hoping for the coronavirus pandemic to end.
