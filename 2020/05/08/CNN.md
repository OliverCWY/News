（CNN）当弗拉维奥·拉莫斯（Flavio Ramos）走进医院时，他喘不过气来，滑倒在意识中。
55岁的弗拉维奥·拉莫斯（Flavio Ramos）还是厄瓜多尔瓜亚基尔（Coaya）的另一名Covid-19受害者，厄瓜多尔是世界上最严重的冠状病毒爆发地点之一。
在安娜·玛丽亚（Ana Maria）离开医院之前，另一位患者的女儿在他们的病房里对她讲话。
美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）要求政府提供有关遗失多少遗骸的确切数字，但截至发稿时，尚未听到任何回音。
在弗拉维奥·拉莫斯（Flavio Ramos）死后一个多月，对他的名字的搜索会弹出一个仅显示“没有找到结果”的弹出窗口。

(CNN) When Flavio Ramos was wheeled into the hospital room, he was gasping for air and slipping in and out of consciousness.
Flavio Ramos, 55, is yet another Covid-19 victim in Guayaquil, Ecuador , the site of one of the world's worst coronavirus outbreaks.
Before Ana Maria left the hospital, the daughter of another patient spoke to her in their hospital room.
CNN asked the government for exact figures on how many remains are missing, but as of publication, had not heard back.
More than a month after Flavio Ramos' death, a search for his name launches a pop-up window that reads only: 'No Results Found.'

伦敦（CNN）高调运抵英国的40万件手术服，被部长们称呼为解决英国个​​人防护装备（PPE）短缺的解决方案，但灾难已经结束了，从那里运来的每件服装都被认为无法使用火鸡。
DHSC补充说：“所有的PPE交付都经过检查，以确保设备符合我们一线员工所需的安全和质量标准。”
据《每日电讯报》（The Telegraph）报道，这件礼服被围在希思罗机场附近的仓库里。
发言人星期四对记者说，如果政府无法获得符合要求的礼服替换订单，政府将要求退款。
4月21日，部长西蒙·克拉克（Simon Clarke）承认，尽管英国不会用完个人防护装备，但“利润空间可能很紧”。

London (CNN) A high-profile shipment to the UK of 400,000 surgical gowns, hailed by ministers as a solution to Britain's personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages, has ended in catastrophe -- with every one of the garments deemed unusable after arriving from Turkey.
"All deliveries of PPE are checked to ensure the equipment meets the safety and quality standards our frontline staff need," the DHSC added.
The gowns instead have sat impounded at a warehouse near Heathrow Airport, according to The Telegraph newspaper , which first reported the story.
The government will request a refund if it cannot get a replacement order of gowns that do meet requirements, a spokesman told reporters on Thursday.
On April 21, minister Simon Clarke conceded that while the UK will not run out of PPE, the "margins can be tight."

Gloricia Woody had entered the restaurant that evening despite the dining area being closed because of coronavirus restrictions, according to police.
When employees asked her to leave, she refused and got into a scuffle with one of them, police said.
Employees eventually forced her outside, but she re-entered the restaurant with a handgun and fired about three rounds, police said.
A fourth worker -- the person who was in the initial scuffle -- suffered a head injury, though it wasn't immediately clear how, according to police.

当然，并非所有人都在大流行期间感到无聊。
曼恩建议：“通过无聊来消除无聊。”
位于加拿大多伦多的约克大学（York University）从事无聊研究已有近二十年，并负责该机构的Boredom实验室。
通过这种方式，无聊会激发人们寻求变化和多样性的动力，并促使我们学习一种新的语言，重新装修或寻找新的工作。

The next big idea in business," said Mann, author of the book " The Science of Boredom: The Upside (and Downside) of Downtime ."
Don't scroll boredom awayOf course, not everyone is experiencing boredom during the pandemic.
"Harness your boredom by getting bored," Mann advised.
York University in Toronto, Canada, has been studying boredom for almost two decades and runs the institution's Boredom Lab.
In this way, boredom could inspire a search for change and variety and spur us to learn a new language, redecorate or look for a new job.

UFC 249 will be hosted in the VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena which has hosted NCAA basketball tournaments.
White told CNN Sport that he's been on some "great" conference calls with Trump, adding "everyone is motivated to try to figure this thing out and bring back sports."
Trying to return during the pandemic comes at a high-profile risk but White sees the UFC as up for the challenge.

The artwork, which Banksy has titled "Game Changer," features a child playing with a nurse doll wearing a face mask and cape.
The hospital has, with Banksy's approval, entitled the piece "Painting for Saints," according to a spokeswoman for UHS.
UHS did not immediately respond to a request to confirm the message that the artist left for the hospital.
Banksy isn't the only high-profile artist to honor Britain's health care workers in recent weeks.

新科学表明，大脑的特定部位与那些罕见但引人入胜的疾病（称为身体完整性烦躁不安或BID）有何不同。
人们认为，这种状况是由于某人的身体形象心理印象与实际身体自我之间的不匹配所致。
该区域与大脑其他区域的连通性降低。
布鲁格观察到类似的现象后，人们开始对这种疾病产生兴趣，在这种现象中，人们的四肢感觉从未完全发育。
布鲁格说：“在一个没有胳膊和腿的妇女的情况下，我们可以证明胳膊和腿在大脑中仍然可以代表。”

New science is showing how specific parts of the brain may differ in those with the rare but fascinating disorder known as body integrity dysphoria, or BID.
The condition is believed to be driven by a mismatch between someone's mental picture of their body image and their actual physical self.
The area had reduced connectivity to other areas of the brain.
Brugger first became interested in the disorder after observing a similar phenomena in which people have sensations of limbs that never fully developed.
"In the case of a woman born without arms and legs, we could show that arms and legs are nevertheless represented in the brain," Brugger said.

根据酒店分析公司STR的Lodging Insights高级副总裁Jan Freitag的说法，在美国，对酒店客房需求的回升隐隐约约。
该品牌正在考虑在前台使用有机玻璃屏障来分隔客人和酒店员工。
无论哪种情况，到2020年入住酒店都将“绝对”比去年便宜。
这些措施通常包括对生病的客人占用的房间进行强化的第三方消毒措施。是否对客人进行筛检？
例如，康奈尔饭店学校（Cornell's Hotel School）的安德森（Anderson）说，客房服务可能会保留下来，因为可以更好地控制谁碰触什么东西，但是自助餐很可能会失败。

In the United States, there are faint glimmers of a return in demand for hotel rooms, according to Jan Freitag, senior vice president of Lodging Insights for hospitality analysis firm STR.
The brand is considering plexiglass barriers at front desks to separate guests and hotel staff.
In either case, staying in a hotel in 2020 will "absolutely" be cheaper than it was last year.
Those measures often include intensive third-party disinfection measures of rooms occupied by guests who become ill.Will guests be screened?
For example, room service might be preserved as there's more control in who touches what, says Anderson, from Cornell's Hotel School, but buffets are likely a no-go.

悉尼（CNN商业）澳大利亚以其海滩和令人兴奋的冲浪而闻名。
但是海洋不仅提供了冲浪者的天堂，它的潮汐也是可再生能源的来源。
利用潮汐潜力的那些公司是总部位于悉尼的Mako Energy。
该公司生产的水下涡轮机直径在2至4米之间。
Mako Energy董事总经理道格拉斯·亨特（Douglas Hunt）对CNN Business表示：“我们正在开发一种可轻松在偏远社区，沿海企业，岛屿社区和度假村中部署的涡轮机。”

Sydney (CNN Business) Australia is famous for its beaches and exhilarating surf.
But the ocean offers more than just a surfer's paradise: its tides are also a source of renewable energy.
Among those harnessing this tidal potential is Sydney-based Mako Energy.
The company makes underwater turbines ranging between two and four meters in diameter.
"We're developing turbines at a scale where they can be deployed easily in remote communities, coastal businesses, island communities and resorts," Douglas Hunt, managing director of Mako Energy, told CNN Business.

现在，新一代的数字艺术家正在将摄影与图像处理技术相结合，以根据自己的意愿弯曲，扭曲和扭曲城市。
用建筑制作艺术品西班牙艺术家和摄影师Victor Enrich在拉脱维亚里加旅行期间开始对建筑照片进行改造。
拍摄完建筑物的照片后，Enrich会以数字方式绘制透视图和建筑物的建筑线条。
“建筑小说”的作品这种城市数字艺术很少以明确的形式来讨论。
他在一封电子邮件采访中说：“近年来，有很多艺术家使用类似的计算机工具来研究建筑图像。”

Now, a new breed of digital artists is combining photography with image manipulation techniques to bend, twist and distort cities to their will.
Making art from architectureSpanish artist and photographer Victor Enrich began transforming architectural photos during a trip to Riga, Latvia.
Once he has photographed a building, Enrich digitally maps the perspective and the building's architectural lines.
Works of 'architectural fiction'This type of urban digital art is rarely discussed in terms of being an explicit genre.
"In recent years, there have been quite a few artists working on images of architecture using similar computer tools," he said in an email interview.

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
后来空袭被估计是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.
