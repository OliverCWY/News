(CNN) A woman has been arrested on suspicion of shooting a fast-food worker and injuring others after they told her to leave a McDonald's restaurant in Oklahoma City on Wednesday, police said.

Gloricia Woody had entered the restaurant that evening despite the dining area being closed because of coronavirus restrictions, according to police.

When employees asked her to leave, she refused and got into a scuffle with one of them, police said. Employees eventually forced her outside, but she re-entered the restaurant with a handgun and fired about three rounds, police said.

One worker was shot in the arm, and two others were struck by shrapnel. A fourth worker -- the person who was in the initial scuffle -- suffered a head injury, though it wasn't immediately clear how, according to police.

Three were taken to a hospital; none of the injures was life-threatening, police said.
