Denmark was one of the first European countries to go into lockdown in the middle of March and it is among the first to relax restrictions.

Smaller shops are already open, but shopping centres will now be allowed to welcome visitors from 11 May.

A week later, restaurants can open up. And older children can return to school.

"It is thanks to a united and impressive effort that we arein a situation where we are one of the countries that can starta serious reopening of our society once again," Prime MinisterMette Frederiksen said.

But there will be curbs on opening hours and numbers of people, and social distancing will remain in force.

Denmark has registered 514 deaths and more than 10,000 cases of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic.
