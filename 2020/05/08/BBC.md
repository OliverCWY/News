美国司法部正在取消对前国家安全顾问迈克尔·弗林的刑事指控。
特朗普周四表示，他“对弗林将军感到非常高兴”。
在2016年竞选期间，他曾是特朗普先生的早期和热心支持者，尽管他以前是一生的民主党人。
弗林（Flynn）是新任总统的首批任命之一-特朗普在大选获胜后的几天内就将他带上。
特朗普先生上台之前曾与俄罗斯驻华盛顿大使讨论解除对俄罗斯的制裁，并就该对话对副总统撒谎，之后特朗普解雇了他。

Image copyright ReutersThe US Department of Justice is moving to drop the criminal charges against former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
On Thursday, Mr Trump said he was "very happy for General Flynn".
He was an early and ardent supporter of Mr Trump during the 2016 campaign, though he had been a life-long Democrat before.
Flynn was among the new president's first appointments - Mr Trump brought him on just days after winning the election.
Mr Trump fired him after it emerged that he had discussed lifting sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to Washington before Mr Trump took office and had lied to the vice-president about that conversation.

## 英国花园杂草盛宴

### A British feast from garden weeds

那是自小时候以来我第一次发现英国觅食的艺术。
在农业和超级市场发明之前，以及原始森林仍然覆盖着大多数不列颠群岛的时代，我们最早的祖先利用对土地的敏锐了解来完全依靠他们可获得的数百种英国野生食品维持生计。
有关英国合法和可持续觅食的信息，请访问不列颠群岛植物学会。
受杰米·奥利弗（Jamie Oliver）最近在Instagram上发布的启发，我的其他菜肴采用了融合方法，将古老的英国食材与意大利技术相结合。
蒲公英叶与樱桃番茄，罗勒和意大利乳清干酪混合后变成了“香蒜酱”，但结果却产生了苦涩，多叶的绿色风味。

And that’s when, for the first time since my childhood, I (re)discovered the art of British foraging.
Before the invention of farming and supermarkets, and at a time when virgin forests still covered most of the British Isles, our earliest ancestors used their razor-sharp knowledge of the land to sustain themselves entirely from the hundreds of British wild foods available to them.
For information on legal and sustainable foraging in Britain, visit the Botanical Society of the British Isles.
Inspired by Jamie Oliver’s recent Instagram post, my other dishes took a fusion approach, combining ancient British ingredients with Italian techniques.
The dandelion leaves were turned into “pesto” by blending them with cherry tomatoes, basil and ricotta, but the result had a bitter, leafy green flavour.

对于某些人来说，在家工作是一种礼物–集中精力和高产的绝佳机会，同时还能抽出时间walk狗甚至穿着睡衣锻炼。
有些人发现他们八个小时的工作就是回两封电子邮件，梦见按摩或发现他们的“奶酪时光”。
的确是这样：有些人的性格和性格特征使他们比其他人更好地适应新的远程工作世界。
您不一定注定要在远程工作方面有好有坏，某些人可能只需要比其他人付出更多的努力即可。
而且由于没有办公室的强大环境，消除不愉快的任务要容易得多。

For some, working from home is a gift – a remarkable opportunity to focus and be hyper-productive, all the while finding time to walk the dog and even exercise in pyjamas.
Some find all they’ve done with their eight hours is answer two emails, dream about a massage or discover their ‘cheese hour’.
It’s true: some people simply have dispositions and personality traits that enable them to better adjust to the new world of remote work than others.
You’re not necessarily destined to be good or bad at working remotely – some may just have to put in more effort than others.
And without the strong situation of an office, it’s quite a bit easier to dismiss unpleasant tasks.

爱德华·菲利普（Edouard Philippe）说，该国的感染率被“一分为二”。
在法国准备周一放宽封锁之际，商店和一些学校被允许重新开放。
菲利普总理周四表示，将在数周内取消3月17日实行的限制。
暂时，绿色区域的限制将比红色区域的限制放宽。
在巴黎和四个毗邻的地区-法兰西岛，法兰西岛上的豪斯，勃艮第大区-弗朗什-孔德大区-红色区域，公园和花园将保持关闭。

Edouard Philippe said the country was "cut in two" in terms of the rate of infections.
It comes as France prepares to relax its lockdown on Monday, with shops and some schools allowed to reopen.
Restrictions - introduced on 17 March - would be lifted over the course of several weeks, Prime Minister Philippe said on Thursday.
Restrictions will be eased more in the green areas than the red for the time being.
In Paris and the four adjoining regions - Ile-de-France, Hauts-de-France, Grand Est Bourgogne-Franche-Comte - which comprise the red zone, public parks and gardens will stay shut.

自3月中旬以来，新申请使失业申请总数达到3,330万，约占美国劳动力的20％。
经济学家表示，将于周五公布的4月份每月失业率可能达到15％或更高。
就在两个月前，失业率只有3.5％，是50年来的最低水平。
同时，数周上升的失业率要求已远远超过之前的纪录70万。
穆迪投资者服务公司（Moody's Investors Service）预测，到年底失业率可能会回落至7％，但这一预测取决于病毒。

The new applications brought the total number of jobless claims since mid-March to 33.3 million- or about 20% of the US workforce.
Economists say the monthly unemployment rate for April, which will be released on Friday, is likely to reach 15% or higher.
Just two months ago, the unemployment rate was at 3.5%, a 50-year low.
Meanwhile, weeks of elevated unemployment claims have far surpassed the prior record of 700,000.
Moody's Investors Service has predicted that the unemployment rate could fall back to 7% by the end of the year, but that forecast depends on the virus.

甚至在大流行之前，优步就在努力平衡收支平衡，在2019年亏损了85亿美元。

Lyft周三表示，随着美国开始执行停工令，Lyft的出行次数下降了70％以上。

Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi will also waive his base salary - set at $1m (£809,690) in 2019 - through to the year end.
Even before the pandemic, Uber was struggling to balance its books, making a loss of $8.5bn in 2019.
Uber said the reductions will come from its customer support and recruiting teams, and would result in $20m in severance pay and other costs.
"Uber and Lyft face Herculean-like challenges looking ahead as the new reality will likely change the business models of these companies [and competitors] for the foreseeable future," he wrote in a note.

While people have been confined to their homes this spring, wildlife has faced less human disturbance, traffic and polluting fumes.
One animal that could see a much-needed revival is the wild bee, scientists say.
Bee populations are rapidly declining around the world due to habitat loss, pollution and the use of pesticides, among other factors.

您不会期望的是，如果氧气罐是假的，那么您可以实现完全相同的目的–它是空的。
“血液中没有氧气，体内没有氧气，但是您可以获得与真实氧气完全相同的效果。
真正的答案是我们不清楚。
任何职业运动员都会告诉您，他们对获胜的信念在成功中扮演着重要的角色，研究表明，通过改变他们的期望，安慰剂效应可以对他们走多快或走多远产生强大影响。

As you might expect, giving someone an oxygen tank to breathe from will reverse these changes.
What you wouldn’t expect is that you can achieve exactly the same thing if the oxygen tank is a fake – it’s empty.
“There is no oxygen in the blood, there is no oxygen in the body, but you can get the very same effect as real oxygen.
The real answer is we don’t know.”Harder, faster, strongerWe normally hear about the placebo effect in a medical context.
Any professional athlete will tell you that their beliefs about winning play a huge role in success, and research suggests that by modifying their expectations, the placebo effect can have a powerful impact on how fast or how far they can go.

我坚定地抵御微风，站在苏格兰和英国边界西南端的标志处调查现场。
人们认为，可争议土地是英国最后的大领土分区。
苏格兰和英格兰之间的界线是根据1237年的《约克条约》建立的。
正如格雷厄姆·罗伯（Graham Robb）在他2018年的书《有争议的土地：苏格兰和英格兰之间的失落世界》中所写的那样，它“可能是欧洲最古老的国界”。
这座人造堤防，今天几乎看不到，是一个三英里半长的屏障，最终将可耕地分成两部分。

Standing firm against a determined breeze, I was surveying the scene from what marks the south-western end of the border between Scotland and England.
The Debatable Lands is believed to have been the last great territorial division in Britain.
The line between Scotland and England was established with the Treaty of York in 1237.
As Graham Robb writes in his 2018 book, The Debatable Land: The Lost World Between Scotland and England, it is “probably the oldest national boundary in Europe”.
This man-made embankment, little of which is visible today, was a three-and-a-half-mile-long barrier that finally divided the Debatable Lands in two.

我将向您解释为什么惊奇电影宇宙（MCU）会在片刻之内成为我的快乐之地，但首先我需要告诉您一些悲伤的事情。
他们的灯光和阴影Marvel Cinematic Universe确实是一个欢乐的世界。
当然，它涉及的是严肃的主题，例如反恐战争，政府的过度控制，以及整个宇宙的一半种族灭绝。
仙境传说（Ragnarok）可能是迄今为止Marvel最具特色的个人产品-尽管存在这个世俗的环境，但怀蒂提（Waitiiti）的呆滞，自我指责的幽默感使事情特别扎根和易于获取。

I’m going to explain to you why the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is my happy place in a moment but first I need to tell you about something sad.
Their light and shadeThe Marvel Cinematic Universe really is a joyous one.
Sure, it deals with serious subjects, like the war on terror, government overreach and, you know, the genocide of half the universe.
Ragnarok is probably the most distinctive individual Marvel offering so far – Waititi’s deadpan, self-referential humour keeps things especially grounded and accessible, despite the out-of-this-world setting.

在瑞典企业家和环保主义者约翰内斯·沃特隆容·佩尔森（Johannes Wretljung Persson）参加的仅限男性参加的会议上，很少有话题是禁止的。
色情的影响，俱乐部的摸索和工作中的厌恶女性的取笑已经引起了广泛的争论。
活动范围从点燃烛光的晚宴到关于外卖炸玉米饼的辩论或在空办公室工作后的简单咖啡晚会。
其他人则作为非正式的支持会议，使男人专注于自己当前的关系和心理健康。
平等的女性联合创始人艾达·奥斯滕森（IdaÖstensson）在Facebook上发布消息称，男人应该考虑让自己的私人团体聚在一起讨论这个问题。

Few topics are off-limits at the male-only meetings attended by Swedish entrepreneur and environmentalist Johannes Wretljung Persson.
The impact of porn, groping in clubs and misogynist banter at work have already been widely debated.
Events have ranged from candle-lit dinner parties to debates over take-away tacos or simple coffee evenings after work in empty offices.
Others serve as more informal support sessions in which men focus on their own current relationships and mental health.
The female co-founder of Make Equal, Ida Östensson, posted on Facebook that men should consider getting their own private groups together to discuss the problem.

因为宜家是扁平包装家具的拥护者，自1953年推出其简单，稳定的圆形Delfi桌子以来，就一直如此。
其他希望将设计推向扁平化议程的企业包括瑞典制造商Hem，墨西哥的Luken和英国的Nomad。
同样，Nomad的原型海洋塑料椅子是从一张100％回收的海洋塑料中切出的。
而且，其生态证书-运输较小的箱子而不是笨重的现成物品可以减少碳足迹-使扁平包装的家具在当今尤其有吸引力。
如果良好的设计可以帮助自组装摆脱其劣质形象，那么未来将是平淡无奇的。

Because Ikea is the champion of flat-packed furniture, and has been ever since the launch of its simple, stable, circular Delfi table in 1953.
Other ventures hoping to push design up flat-packed agenda include Swedish manufacturer Hem, Mexico’s Luken, and Nomad in the UK.
Likewise, Nomad’s prototype Ocean Plastic Chair is cut out of a sheet of 100% recycled ocean plastic.
And its eco-credentials – transporting smaller boxes rather than bulky ready-built items results in a lower carbon footprint – makes flat-packed furniture particularly appealing these days.
If good design can help self-assembly shake off its shoddy image, then the future is flat-packed.

Derbyshire auctioneer Hansons says hardback first editions of the book are "as rare as hens' teeth".
"Last year we were watching a TV interview with Charles Hanson, owner of Hansons Auctioneers, about the sale of a Harry Potter first edition which sold for thousands at auction and decided to get in touch."
There were 500 hardback first editions of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone printed in 1997.
