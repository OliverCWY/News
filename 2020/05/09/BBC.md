报业协会版权所有：报业协会希思罗机场曾表示，任何隔离措施必须在医学上有效，符合公众的期望并且可以由机场交付。
这些评论是针对可能对到达英国的旅客实施14天检疫的回应。
发言人说：“我们将继续竭尽所能，支持政府应对健康危机，同时为英国各个角落的英国企业保持重要的贸易路线。”
“希思罗机场不仅仅是一个机场，它是为这个国家保持经济血液流动的心脏，当英国准备一起重建英国时，我们的行业具有迅速反弹的能力至关重要，这是至关重要的。”
希思罗机场的老板们说，航空业需要有一个共同的国际标准。

Press Association Copyright: Press AssociationHeathrow Airport has said that any quarantine measures must be medically effective, meet public expectations and be deliverable by airports.
The comments come in response to the prospect of a 14-day quarantine being implemented for travellers arriving in the UK.
"We will continue to do everything we can to support the government in tackling the health crisis whilst keeping vital trading routes open for British businesses in every corner of the UK,” a spokesman said.
"Heathrow is more than just an airport, it is the heart that keeps economic blood flowing for this country and it is vital our industry has the ability to bounce back quickly when the UK is ready to build back Britain together."
Heathrow bosses said there needs to be a common international standard for health in aviation.

朝鲜政府坚持认为，目前还没有一个确诊病例，尽管分析人士质疑这是否可能。
一月的第三周，朝鲜是第一个暂停旅游业并关闭边界以应对这种病毒的国家。
北京有一些很好的理由想要帮助朝鲜。
北京还担心，如果该病毒被感染，朝鲜内部将会发生什么。
如果朝鲜似乎接受北京的帮助，中国将在有需要时重申自己是朝鲜的“真正”盟友。

North Korea's government maintains that there has not been a single confirmed case there, though analysts have questioned whether that is possible.
North Korea was the first country to suspend tourism and to shut its borders in response to the virus, in the third week of January.
Beijing has a few good reasons for wanting to help North Korea.
Beijing also worries about what might happen inside North Korea if the virus takes hold.
If North Korea appeared to accept Beijing's help, China would reassert itself as North Korea's "true" ally in a time of need.

特朗普上周五对福克斯新闻说：“我的心向父母，家人和朋友表达。”
拜登先生说，阿伯里先生已被“冷血击落”，并“基本上在我们眼前被私刑了”。
格雷戈里·麦克迈克尔（Gregory McMichael）告诉警方，他相信阿伯里（Arbery）先生在一系列本地闯入活动中类似于嫌疑犯。
麦克迈尔（McMichael）老人告诉警方，他要求阿伯里（Arbery）停下来讲话，并声称25岁的儿子袭击了他的儿子。
36秒的片段似乎显示年轻的麦克麦克尔先生在阿伯里先生的空白地带射击了shot弹枪，而受害者倒在了街上。

"My heart goes out to the parents and the family and friends," Mr Trump told Fox News on Friday.
Mr Biden said Mr Arbery had been "shot down in cold blood" and "essentially lynched before our very eyes".
Gregory McMichael told police he believed Mr Arbery resembled the suspect in a series of local break-ins.

The 36-second clip appears to show the younger Mr McMichael firing a shotgun at point blank range at Mr Arbery and the victim falling to the street.

如今，全世界都在致力于对抗最新的病毒，这种病毒已经越过了人类的物种壁垒。
严重急性呼吸系统综合症（SARS）（于2002年首次发现）被认为是从蝙蝠传播过来的，可能是通过猫猫传播的。
迄今为止的证据表明，中东呼吸综合征（中东呼吸综合症）在人与骆驼之间移动。
物种之间的这种病毒转移，然后跳入人类，被称为人畜共患病。
但是，有科学家在努力找出这些跳跃并帮助防止致命的后果-病毒猎人。

Today, the entire world is caught up in the quest to combat the latest virus, which has crossed the species barrier into humans.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS (first identified in 2002) is thought to have passed from bats, possibly via civet cats.
Evidence so far is that MERS, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, moves between humans and camels.
This viral transfer between species and then jumping into humans is called zoonosis.
But there are scientists working hard to identify these jumps and help prevent deadly consequences – the virus hunters.

彭斯（Pence）的新闻秘书凯蒂·米勒（Katie Miller）周五在唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）总统的代客拜访后一天测试了阳性。
特朗普星期五在白宫与共和党人会面时对记者说：“她是一个很了不起的年轻女子，凯蒂。”
当被问及白宫爆发疫情的可能性时，特朗普先生告诉记者：“您所能做的就是采取预防措施，并尽力而为。”
周五早些时候，特朗普先生告诉福克斯和朋友们，他的代客已经开始戴口罩。
后来，白宫新闻秘书凯里·麦肯尼（Kayleigh McEnany）为白宫为确保官员安全所采取的措施辩护。

图片来源：Getty Images英国航空公司表示，他们已被告知政府应对因冠状病毒大流行而从爱尔兰共和国以外任何国家到达英国的任何人进行为期14天的隔离。
英国航空业组织表示，该政策需要“可靠的退出计划”，并且应每周进行审查。
代表英国航空，EasyJet和其他英国航空公司的英国航空公司在一份声明中说：“我们需要查看他们提出的建议的细节。”
英国机场认为，隔离不仅会对英国航空业造成毁灭性影响，而且还会对整个经济产生破坏性影响。
上周日，安德鲁·马尔（Andrew Marr）询问运输部长，英国是否将对抵达英国的人实行检疫。

Industry body Airlines UK said the policy needed "a credible exit plan" and should be reviewed weekly.
"We need to see the details of what they are proposing", said Airlines UK, which represents British Airways, EasyJet and other UK-based airlines, in a statement.
UK airports suggested that a quarantine "would not only have a devastating impact on the UK aviation industry, but also on the wider economy".
Last Sunday, Andrew Marr asked the transport secretary whether the UK would introduce a quarantine on people arriving in the UK.

上升意味着失业率现在比1930年代大萧条以来的任何时候都要糟糕。
就在两个月前，失业率只有3.5％，是50年来的最低水平。
报告说，包括这些回应表明失业率接近20％。
在黑人工人中，失业率跃升至16.7％，是2010年以来的最高水平。
总体而言，失业率是1948年数据中记录的最高水平，而按月就业人数的下降是1939年数据中记录的最大失业率。

The rise means the jobless rate is now worse than at any time since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Just two months ago, the unemployment rate was at 3.5%, a 50-year low.
Including those responses suggests an unemployment rate closer to 20%, it said.
Among black workers, the unemployment rate jumped to 16.7%, the highest since 2010.
Overall, the unemployment rate was the highest recorded in data back to 1948, while the over-the-month jobs decline was the largest reported in data back to 1939.

四名飞行员，另外两名空姐和一名航空公司高管被指控帮助他通过伊斯坦布尔逃往黎巴嫩。
戈恩先生在声称存在金融不当行为后逃离了日本，他否认了这一说法。
当时有政府官员说，没有通知土耳其戈恩先生的到来，也没有通知他离开土耳其。
戈恩先生轰动性逃生的全部细节从未得到充分解释。

随着冠状病毒危机的继续，人们经常在严格的封锁措施下被困在家中。
怀特罗斯和约翰·刘易斯（John Lewis）的一份新报告已经追踪了其客户每周购买的商品。
独立零售分析师理查德·海曼（Richard Hyman）说，尽管“约翰·刘易斯合伙制公司是刻板印象的中产阶级零售商，但它具有非常广泛的吸引力”。
根据Waitrose的说法，在3月24日至4月底之间，龙舌兰酒的销量增长了175％以上。
约翰·刘易斯（John Lewis）说，瑜伽垫和脚踝配重块的销量很快，增长了496％。

A new report by Waitrose and John Lewis has tracked what its customers have been purchasing from week to week.
Although the "John Lewis Partnership is a stereotypically middle-class retailer, it has a very broad appeal," said independent retail analyst Richard Hyman.
According to Waitrose, sales of tequila increased by more than 175% between 24 March and the end of April.
John Lewis says it has seen a rise of 496%, with yoga mats and ankle weights selling quickly.

柴先生周四表示，此举以及该公司已做出的其他举动，今年将节省逾10亿美元（8.1亿英镑），但可能有必要采取更多措施。
Khosrowshahi先生说，在获得订单后，Uber的乘车业务（占收入的大部分）在4月份下降了80％。
例如，在香港，霍斯罗萨西表示，需求已恢复到危机前水平的约70％。
Khosrowshahi先生说，这场危机将使该公司的获利目标推迟大约四分之一，而不是几年。

Image copyright Getty ImagesUber has warned it may scale back parts of the business as it tries to navigate through the coronavirus crisis.
That move, and others the firm has made, will save more than $1bn (£810m) this year, but more measures may be necessary Mr Chai said on Thursday.
Uber's rides business - which contributes the bulk of its revenue - was down 80% in April, after the orders were instituted, Mr Khosrowshahi said.
In Hong Kong, for example, Mr Khosrowshahi said demand has returned to about 70% of its pre-crisis levels.
Mr Khosrowshahi said that the crisis would delay the firm's goal of becoming profitable by a matter of "quarters, not years".

## 旧金山的宽容精神来自何方

北加州的文化中心旧金山一直被称为不合格城市。
由于存在如此巨大的悬殊，许多人怀疑旧金山的进取心胸开阔的态度能否生存下去。
•旧金山为何要发酸
旧金山几乎在一夜之间变成了一个新兴城市-一个无法无天的地方，赌博厅和妓院泛滥成灾，男性人口远远超过女性。
惠誉（Fitch）在当晚的报纸上发表了这一宣言，很快，一个新的旧金山传奇诞生了。

Northern California’s cultural hub, San Francisco, has always been known as a city of nonconformity.
With so much disparity, many wonder whether San Francisco’s progressive, open-minded attitude can survive.
• Why San Francisco does sourdough best“San Francisco has been a city of change since day one,” Amster, a city tour guide and amateur San Francisco historian, told me.
San Francisco became a boomtown practically overnight – a lawless place where gambling halls and brothels ran rampant and the male population far outweighed the female.
Fitch printed the proclamation in that evening’s paper, and soon enough a new San Francisco legend was born.

对于某些人来说，在家工作是一种礼物–一个难得的集中精力和高产的机会，同时还能抽出时间walk狗甚至穿着睡衣运动。
有些人发现他们八个小时的工作就是回两封电子邮件，梦见按摩或发现他们的“奶酪时光”。
的确是这样：有些人的性格和性格特征使他们比其他人更好地适应新的远程工作世界。
您不一定注定要在远程工作方面有好有坏，某些人可能只需要比其他人付出更多的努力即可。
而且由于没有办公室的强大环境，消除不愉快的任务要容易得多。

For some, working from home is a gift – a remarkable opportunity to focus and be hyper-productive, all the while finding time to walk the dog and even exercise in pyjamas.
Some find all they’ve done with their eight hours is answer two emails, dream about a massage or discover their ‘cheese hour’.
It’s true: some people simply have dispositions and personality traits that enable them to better adjust to the new world of remote work than others.
You’re not necessarily destined to be good or bad at working remotely – some may just have to put in more effort than others.
And without the strong situation of an office, it’s quite a bit easier to dismiss unpleasant tasks.

我们突然生活在这个陌生而动荡的世界中，不再适合我们用来描述生活的疲倦的音节和陈旧的语言。
规则1：使用“ -ness”后缀“ -ness”可以将原本就不起眼的单词转变为陌生的词，并且更抽象。
例如，形容词“黑暗”表面上是坦率而真实的，而“黑暗”则更具动感和诗意。

The adjective ‘dark’, for example, on its face is frank and factual, whereas ‘darkness’ is more movingly evocative and poetic.
