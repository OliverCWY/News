94岁的Tun Mahathir和72岁的Datuk Seri Anwar表示，他们在PH执政22个月前实施了许多改革，直到2月底被拆除为止。
我们已经老了，我们没有太多时间了，”马哈迪博士和安瓦尔先生说。
当PH在大选中取得令人赞叹的胜利时，马哈蒂尔博士第二次当选总理，而安瓦尔则获得了王室赦免并被释放出狱。
安瓦尔先生的支持者表示，PH领导人已同意马哈迪博士在赢得权力后的两年内将总理职位交给安瓦尔。
Mahathir博士是Bersatu的董事长，而Muhyiddin先生是Bersatu的总裁。

Tun Mahathir, 94, and Datuk Seri Anwar, 72, said many of the reforms they introduced when PH was in power for 22 months until end-February were being dismantled.
We are old, and we do not have much time left," Dr Mahathir and Mr Anwar said.
When PH scored a stunning victory in the general election, Dr Mahathir became prime minister for the second time while Mr Anwar was given a royal pardon and released from prison.
Mr Anwar's supporters say that PH leaders had agreed for Dr Mahathir to pass the premiership to Mr Anwar within two years of winning power.
Dr Mahathir is chairman of Bersatu while Mr Muhyiddin is its president.

新加坡-卫生部（MOH）截至5月9日星期六已在新加坡初步确认了753例新的Covid-19病例，总数达到22,460例。
其中有九名新加坡人和永久居民，而住在其余宿舍的民工占大多数。
新加坡目前是东南亚冠状病毒病例数最高的国家，最近几周病例数激增。
卫生部说，最近案件的激增很大程度上是由于宿舍工人案件的增加。
这种无关联的案件也从两周前的平均每天六起下降到上周的五起。

SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed 753 new Covid-19 cases in Singapore as of Saturday noon (May 9), taking the total count to 22,460.
Among these are nine Singaporeans and permanent residents, while migrant workers living in dormitories form the bulk of the remaining cases.
Singapore, which now has the highest number of coronavirus cases in South-east Asia, has seen a surge in cases in recent weeks.
The recent spike in cases is largely driven by a rise in cases among workers in dormitories, said MOH.
Such unlinked cases have also fallen from an average of six cases a day two weeks ago, to five in the past week.

据英国广播公司报道，美国天文学家使用“幸运成像”红外技术制作了木星行星的开创性照片，该技术消除了地球大气层在图像中引起的畸变。
加州大学伯克利分校的团队使用夏威夷的双子座北望远镜，朱诺号航天器和哈勃太空望远镜，通过多次非常短的曝光并仅保留“幸运”的图像，可以制作出地球上最清晰的图像。在地球大气短暂稳定期间捕获的清晰图像。
由此产生的图像拼接图揭示了风暴系统在行星巨大的60公里高的风暴云下方的水冰和液体的深云周围形成，并使研究人员更仔细地了解了构成和维持地球天气系统的因素。
这些包括深水蒸气云，由潮湿空气制成的大型对流塔，类似于地球上的雷云，以及下面的净空区域。
了解木星的大气层和水含量可以帮助科学家了解地球的形成方式。

SINGAPORE - US astronomers have produced groundbreaking photos of the planet Jupiter using "lucky imaging" infrared technology that eliminates the distortion that the Earth's atmosphere causes in images, the BBC reported.
Using the Gemini North Telescope in Hawaii, the Juno spacecraft and the Hubble Space Telescope, the team from the University of California at Berkeley was able to create the sharpest images yet of the planet by taking multiple very short exposures and keeping only the "lucky" sharp images that were captured while the Earth's atmosphere was briefly stable.
The resulting mosaic of images reveal storm systems forming around deep clouds of water ice and liquid beneath the planet's massive 60km high storm clouds, and give researchers a closer look at what makes and sustains the planet's weather systems.
These include deep water vapour clouds, large convective towers made of moist air similar to thunderhead clouds on Earth, and clear areas below.
Understanding Jupiter's atmosphere and water content can help scientists understand how the planet was formed.

由于Covid-19疫情席卷了马来西亚的经济，成千上万的人争先恐后地寻求可能的工作，包括农民工数十年来从事的工作。
在许多人看来，这个市场是肮脏的，在被MCO强制关闭之前，该市场主要雇用农民工。
在MCO期间，当局还拘留了数百名难民和移徙工人，主要是因为非法居住在该国。
东南亚的第三大经济体拥有220万记录在册的外国工人，330万非法工人及其家庭。
自疫情爆发以来，对该群体的敌意与日俱增，一些马来西亚人指责传播低病毒的低薪移民工人。

As the Covid-19 outbreak ravaged Malaysia's economy, thousands were left scrambling to get whatever jobs they could, including those that migrant workers had been doing for decades.
The market, seen by many as filthy, employed mostly migrant workers before it was forced to close due to the MCO.
During the MCO, hundreds of refugees and migrant workers were also detained by the authorities, mainly for illegally staying in the country.
South-east Asia's third biggest economy is host to 2.2 million documented foreign workers, and another 3.3 million illegal workers and their families.
Since the outbreak, there has been growing hostility against this group, with some Malaysians blaming low-salaried migrant workers for spreading the virus.

研究人员发现，在出现第一个症状后的7天内开始服用鸡尾酒的患者比对照组的患者更早地停止了病毒的脱落-这意味着他们正在康复并且不再具有传染性。
这项研究表明，三药联合治疗的患者似乎也好转得更快，住院时间明显短于对照组。
服用三药鸡尾酒的患者平均在7天内检测到冠状病毒阴性，而使用一种药物治疗的患者平均12天内检测到了冠状病毒阴性。
但她警告说，研究中的所有患者均患有轻度至中度疾病，重要的问题是该药物组合是否会使重症患者受益。
作者计划进行一项更大的试验，以检查鸡尾酒在重症Covid-19患者中的有效性，他们也可能会评估干扰素的有效性。

The patients who were started on the cocktail within seven days of having their first symptoms stopped shedding the virus - meaning they were recovering and no longer infectious - earlier than patients in the comparison group, the researchers found.
The patients on the triple-drug combination also appeared to get better faster, and they had significantly shorter hospital stays than the comparison group, according to the study.
Patients given the three-drug cocktail tested negative for the coronavirus within seven days, on average, compared with an average 12 days among those treated with the one drug.
But she cautioned that all of the patients in the study had mild to moderate disease, and the important question is whether the drug combination will benefit critically ill patients.
The authors plan to conduct a larger trial to examine the effectiveness of the cocktail in critically ill Covid-19 patients, and they may also evaluate the effectiveness of interferon alone.
