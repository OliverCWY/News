A lot of what we normally do relies on people getting close together. We put on cooking courses – we have a chef who works onsite here. Those have had to stop. We can’t have school groups on the farm. The farmers’ markets are still open but people might be scared to go to them. So we’ve had to think of a way to allow customers to come to us in a safe way. Fortunately we have 68 acres to do that.
