Today, the entire world is caught up in the quest to combat the latest virus, which has crossed the species barrier into humans. It’s a situation that unfolded with startling speed, but was not necessarily a surprise.

In the last 30 years, more than 50 novel viruses have leaped from animals to humans: Ebola, swine flu, bird flu, Zika and dengue – to name just a few. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS (first identified in 2002) is thought to have passed from bats, possibly via civet cats. Evidence so far is that MERS, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, moves between humans and camels. We’re not sure where COVID-19 started, but evidence is pointing to bats and possibly pangolins.

This viral transfer between species and then jumping into humans is called zoonosis. Zoonosis is a common but complex event, and it’s difficult to work out how it happens. But there are scientists working hard to identify these jumps and help prevent deadly consequences – the virus hunters.

“The virus hunters, the epidemiologists, the threat detectives – we’ve been going after these zoonotic diseases, these diseases of animals that come to humans, for a long time,” says Larry Brilliant, an epidemiologist who was part of the team that hunted the smallpox virus to extinction in the late 1970s. “It’s not just that they jump from animals to humans at the rate of one to three every year, it’s that there are thousands of them that have not yet made that jump.”
