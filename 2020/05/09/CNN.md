前世界各国领导人警告说，特朗普政府可能会通过将惩罚中国的致命性大流行政治化来推动其惩罚中国，让其他国家选择当事方，从而有可能疏远盟国。
美国政府决定停止为世卫组织（世卫组织）提供资金，世卫组织是最能协调全球对这一大流行病应对措施的机构，这震惊了全球卫生官员。
由于对中国和世界卫生组织的愤怒，美国在7国集团和20国集团会议上同样阻止了全球统一的表达。
“人们希望美国在协调全球努力方面发挥领导作用。
耶茨补充说，全球卫生官员发现，特朗普在大流行“绝对令人震惊”的中间削减了为世卫组织的资金。

Former world leaders warn that the Trump administration risks alienating allies by politicizing the deadly pandemic with its push to punish China and have other nations choose sides.
The administration's decision to halt funding for the WHO , the world body best positioned to coordinate the global response to the raging pandemic, has appalled global health officials.
The US has similarly blocked expressions of global unity at G7 and G20 meetings due to anger about China and the WHO.
"One would expect the US to have a leading role in trying to coordinate global efforts.
Global health officials found Trump's move to cut funding for the WHO in the middle of a pandemic "absolutely breathtaking," Yates added.

## 特朗普寻求重新开放，但在白宫发现了该病毒

### Trump sought a reopening but found the virus in the White House instead

当被问及他的员工周五未戴口罩的原因时，特朗普指着房间里的一位白宫官员：白宫摄影师。
即使特朗普希望在白宫照常开展业务，但肆虐其大门之外的病毒也找到了解决之道。
白宫一位高级官员说，星期五晚上在白宫内部进行了联系追踪，彭斯发言人凯蒂·米勒（Katie Miller）一直与之接触的所有人的测试结果均呈阴性，包括特朗普的高级政策丈夫史蒂芬·米勒（Stephen Miller）顾问。
但是最新的案例涉及工作距离总统和副总统更近的人。
即使白宫医疗队在疫情爆发初期就采取了强有力的筛查和测试方法，这些事件仍然发生。

Asked the reason his staff weren't wearing masks on Friday, Trump pointed to the one White House official in the room who was: the White House photographer.
And even if Trump hopes to project business-as-usual at the White House, the virus raging outside its gates has found a way in.
A senior White House official said Friday evening contact tracing was performed inside the White House, and test results for all of the people Pence spokeswoman Katie Miller had been in contact with came back negative, including for her husband Stephen Miller, who is Trump's senior policy adviser.
But the latest cases involve people who work in much closer proximity to the President and vice president.
And they occurred even with the robust screening and testing practices the White House Medical Unit enacted earlier in the outbreak.

但是，如何应对这种大流行病的两个国家被广为接受：韩国和德国。
38岁的商人Jo Jae-hong对新闻社说：“随着社会隔离的结束，我们正处在人们习惯于日常生活隔离的阶段。”
德国人可以“负担得起勇气”当孩子们于星期四进入德国西部多特蒙德的佩特里小学时，他们尊重社会疏离规则。
他说，德国的权力下放的治理体系，加上国家的协调，意味着可以在当地灵活地决定确切的方式和时间来缓解社会疏远的建议。
但重要的是，德国已经制定了触发条件-如果新案件上升到每十万分之五十以上，德国将自动制止社会隔离的缓解。

But two countries have been widely held up as examples of how to handle a pandemic: South Korea and Germany .
"As we wrap up social distancing, we're at a stage where people are getting used to daily life distancing," Jo Jae-hong, a 38-year-old businessman, told the news agency.
Germans can 'afford courage'Children respect social distancing rules as they enter the Petri primary school in Dortmund, western Germany, on Thursday, as the school reopens for some pupils.
Germany's decentralized governance system, coupled with national coordination, means there is useful local flexibility to decide exactly how and when to ease social distancing recommendations, he said.
But importantly, Germany has instituted a trigger -- if new cases rise above 50 per 100,000, it automatically halts the easing of social distancing.

尽管白俄罗斯的冠状病毒病例越来越多，周六仍有数千人聚集在明斯克参加胜利日阅兵。
与其他前苏联国家不同，白俄罗斯没有在欧洲纪念第二次世界大战结束75周年时取消大规模活动，也没有实施严格的自我隔离规则。
白俄罗斯军人在第二次世界大战结束75周年之际游行，当时没有任何社会疏远措施，人群不断涌动。
卢卡申科说：“在这个疯狂，迷失方向的世界中，会有人批评我们这次神圣事件的时间和地点。”
约翰·霍普金斯大学的数据显示，截至周六，白俄罗斯这个拥有950万人口的国家已正式报告了21,101例冠状病毒病例和120多例死亡。

Thousands of people gathered in Minsk on Saturday to attend a Victory Day military parade, despite increasing numbers of coronavirus cases in Belarus.
Unlike other former Soviet states, Belarus did not cancel mass events to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe and has not imposed strict self-isolation rules.

As of Saturday, Belarus, a country of 9.5 million, has officially reported 21,101 cases of coronavirus and more than 120 deaths, Johns Hopkins University figures show.

## 宝莱坞为什么在电影中使用冒犯性的进攻手段？

但它也没有那么讨人喜欢的声誉-促进棕脸的进攻实践。
例如，流行的2019年电影《巴拉》（Bala）讲述了一个女人因肤色而遭受歧视的故事。

演员莎·鲁克·汗（Shah Rukh Khan）经常被称为``宝莱坞之王''，多年来一直为男人们提供一种公平的面霜``公平与英俊''。
Hari认为，宝莱坞（Bollywood）名人可能会做更多的事情，以改变全国各地对深色皮肤的态度。

But it also has a far less flattering reputation -- for promoting the offensive practice of brownface.
For example, the popular 2019 film "Bala" featured the story of a woman who suffered discrimination on the basis of her skin tone.

Hari believes that Bollywood celebrities could be doing much more to change attitudes across the country to dark skin.

（CNN）香港医生周五报道，三种抗病毒药物加免疫系统增强剂的结合似乎可以帮助患者更快地从冠状病毒感染中恢复。
目前，唯一授权的治疗方法是实验性抗病毒药物瑞姆昔韦，它也可以缩短疾病持续时间，但供应有限。
香港大学的郭永源博士及其同事测试了利托那韦和洛帕那韦的艾滋病毒药物组合，以及普通抗病毒药利巴韦林和一种称为β干扰素的多发性硬化症药物。
Yuen的团队仅向一些患者提供了HIV药物组合，这些药物通常以Kaletra品牌出售。
其他人被随机分配获得洛匹那韦-利托那韦联合抗病毒药物利巴韦林和β-干扰素注射液。

(CNN) A combination of three antiviral drugs plus an immune system booster seemed to help patients recover more quickly from coronavirus infections, doctors in Hong Kong reported Friday.
Currently the only authorized treatment is the experimental antiviral drug remdesivir, which also shortens the duration of illness but is limited in supply.
Dr. Kwok-Yung Yuen at Hong Kong University and colleagues tested the HIV drug combination of ritonavir and lopanivir along with the general antiviral drug ribavirin and a multiple sclerosis drug called beta interferon.
Yuen's team gave some patients only the HIV drug combination, often sold under the brand name Kaletra.
Other were randomly assigned to get the lopinavir-ritonavir combination plus the antiviral drug ribavirin and injections of beta interferon.

白宫的多位发言人没有对这个故事的一再评论请求做出回应。
傍晚，OAN的舆论主持人，如利兹·惠勒（Liz Wheeler）和格雷厄姆·莱杰（Graham Ledger），提出了普遍认可的白宫保守评论。
OAN的另一位杰出的煽动者是右翼阴谋理论家杰克·波索别茨（Jack Posobiec），他是特朗普的坚决支持者。
这封信是由保守派记者约翰·所罗门（John Solomon）在一个网站上发布的，该信谴责了美洲国家组织的通讯员如何“被当作嫌疑人和不想要的闯入者”对待，并恳请白宫“对进入白宫的理由进行控制”。

New York (CNN Business) On one afternoon in April, Yamiche Alcindor, the White House correspondent for PBS Newshour, grew exasperated.
Multiple White House spokespeople did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story.
In the evening, OAN's opinion hosts, such as Liz Wheeler and Graham Ledger, offer run-of-the-mill conservative commentary that is generally approving of the White House.
The other prominent agitator at OAN is Jack Posobiec, a right-wing conspiracy theorist who is a strong supporter of Trump.
The letter, which was posted by a website founded by conservative journalist John Solomon, decried how OAN's correspondents are treated "as if they were suspect and unwanted interlopers" and implored the White House to "assert control over access to White House grounds."

共和党的两个州委员会，即执行委员会和中央委员会，对此事进行了评估，并于4月份支持施蒂弗。
巴克（Buck）以州共和党主席的身份告诉进行初次大会提名程序的州选举官员埃里·布雷默（Eli Bremer）说，应该将Stiver列入选票。
中央委员会通过了一项投票，要求我在该州签署虚假宣誓书。”
巴克再次问：“您知道中央委员会已命令您这样做吗？”
科罗拉多共和党向州最高法院提起上诉，该法院周二拒绝审理此案。

Two GOP state committees, the Executive Committee and the Central Committee, weighed in on the matter and sided with Stiver in April.
Buck, in his capacity as the state GOP chairman, told Eli Bremer, the state election official who conducted the initial assembly nominating process, that Stiver should be included on the ballot.
The Central Committee has adopted a vote that requires me to sign a false affidavit to the state," Bremer responded.
Buck again asked: "And you understand that Central Committee has ordered you to do so?"
The Colorado Republican Party appealed to the state Supreme Court, which on Tuesday declined to hear the case.

非白人美国人，尤其是非裔美国人，几乎在各个方面都受到了沉重打击。
根据人口普查局的数据，非裔美国人占美国人口的大约13％，但已知的Covid-19死亡人数中有27％。
相比之下，美国人口中约60％是白人，但在已知的Covid-19死亡人数中占49％。
这项研究显示，全国黑人居民较多的县占全国冠状病毒诊断的52％，占Covid-19死亡的58％。
即使对于可能没有被自己感染的黑人美国人来说，这场破坏也是个人的。

And nonwhite Americans, especially African Americans, have been hit hard on nearly every front.
To put those numbers into context, African Americans make up about 13% of the US population , according to the Census Bureau, but 27% of known Covid-19 deaths.
In contrast, about 60% of the US population is white, but make up 49% of known Covid-19 deaths.
Counties with higher populations of black residents accounted for 52% of coronavirus diagnoses and 58% of Covid-19 deaths nationally, according to the study.
Even for black Americans who might not have gotten infected themselves, the devastation has been personal.

（CNN）国际奥委会运动监察机构负责人约翰·科茨（John Coates）表示，国际奥委会（IOC）的行动依据是，东京奥运会将于2021年举行，没有再次推迟奥运会的B计划。
国际奥委会运动会视察部门负责人约翰·科茨（John Coates）说：“我们的工作是没有很好的计划B再次推迟奥运会，或者类似的事情。”
由于冠状病毒爆发的影响，国际奥委会和日本政府将3月的奥运会推迟到2021年7月。
“我们在国际奥委会有一个特别工作组，即日本的一个特别工作组。
这是一项艰巨的工作，我们正在努力获得相同的场地，相同的43个场地。

"We're proceeding on the basis that well there is no Plan B of deferring the games again or anything like that," said John Coates, head of the IOC's inspectorate for the Games Saturday.
The International Olympic Committee and the Japanese government postponed the Games in March until July 2021 because of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
"We've got a task force at the IOC, a taskforce in Japan.
This is a massive exercise, and we are working through now getting the same venues, the same 43 venues.

根据酒店分析公司STR的Lodging Insights高级副总裁Jan Freitag的说法，在美国，对酒店客房需求的回升隐隐约约。
该品牌正在考虑在前台使用有机玻璃屏障来分隔客人和酒店员工。
无论哪种情况，到2020年入住酒店都将“绝对”比去年便宜。
这些措施通常包括对生病的客人占用的房间进行强化的第三方消毒措施。是否对客人进行筛检？
例如，康奈尔饭店学校（Cornell's Hotel School）的安德森（Anderson）说，客房服务可能会保留下来，因为可以更好地控制谁碰触什么东西，但是自助餐很可能是行不通的。

In the United States, there are faint glimmers of a return in demand for hotel rooms, according to Jan Freitag, senior vice president of Lodging Insights for hospitality analysis firm STR.
The brand is considering plexiglass barriers at front desks to separate guests and hotel staff.
In either case, staying in a hotel in 2020 will "absolutely" be cheaper than it was last year.
Those measures often include intensive third-party disinfection measures of rooms occupied by guests who become ill.Will guests be screened?
For example, room service might be preserved as there's more control in who touches what, says Anderson, from Cornell's Hotel School, but buffets are likely a no-go.

“我认为我们目睹的海洋动物可能是短暂的。”
Epps说，最终，当前的危机并未改变海洋保护的议程。

Greater visibilityThe sightings of rays, sharks, and dolphins are welcome to Natalie Banks, founder and president of Dubai-based marine conservation group Azraq, who suggests our absence provides some breathing space for aquatic species.
But Banks does see opportunities in this heightened visibility of marine species.
"A lot of people see the UAE as being a desert...and don't think about the marine wildlife, but actually we're blessed here," says Banks.
"I think the kind of sightings of marine animals we are seeing are likely to be short lived."
Ultimately, the current crisis has not changed the agenda for marine conservation, says Epps.

悉尼（CNN商业）澳大利亚以其海滩和令人兴奋的冲浪而闻名。
但是海洋不仅提供了冲浪者的天堂，它的潮汐也是可再生能源的来源。
利用潮汐潜力的那些公司是总部位于悉尼的Mako Energy。
该公司制造的水下涡轮机直径在2至4米之间。
Mako Energy董事总经理道格拉斯·亨特（Douglas Hunt）对CNN Business表示：“我们正在开发一种可轻松在偏远社区，沿海企业，岛屿社区和度假村中部署的涡轮机。”

Sydney (CNN Business) Australia is famous for its beaches and exhilarating surf.
But the ocean offers more than just a surfer's paradise: its tides are also a source of renewable energy.
Among those harnessing this tidal potential is Sydney-based Mako Energy.
The company makes underwater turbines ranging between two and four meters in diameter.
"We're developing turbines at a scale where they can be deployed easily in remote communities, coastal businesses, island communities and resorts," Douglas Hunt, managing director of Mako Energy, told CNN Business.

Collective observations from this dream team have produced stunning images and revealed what's happening inside Jupiter's giant, continuous storms.
Hubble can observe Jupiter in visible and ultraviolet light while Gemini can capture observations in thermal infrared.
Juno is poised to capture radio signals emanating from the lightning in Jupiter's storms.
The radio signals are called "sferics" and "whistlers" that can be used to map lightning even beneath Jupiter's heavy clouds.
Hubble and Gemini provide high-resolution observations at a distance, which can be used to interpret Juno's close-up views of Jupiter.

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
这次空袭后来估计是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

但是，美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）采访了包括帕特里夏（Patricia）在内的五名十几岁左右的女性，他们声称格拉泽（Glaser）在Bery's Place对其进行了性和情感虐待。
当女孩们反对时，他们说格拉泽会威胁要把他们赶出去。
一些幸存者说，格拉瑟（Glaser）介绍自己是一名医生，但是支持检方的律师告诉CNN，他是物理治疗师-不是合格的医生。
Dilen去年2月在Bery's Place进行的一次警察突袭中被警察盘问而被捕，随后被释放。
但至少现在，他们说，他们开始在贝里故居之外享受生活。

But five women in their late teens and early twenties interviewed by CNN, including Patricia, allege that Glaser sexually and emotionally abused them at Bery's Place.
When the girls objected, they say Glaser would threaten to cast them out on the streets.
Some survivors say Glaser introduced himself as a doctor, but lawyers supporting the prosecution told CNN that he is a physiotherapist -- not a qualified physician.
Dilen was arrested for questioning by police last February during a police raid at Bery's Place, and later released.
But for now, at least, they say they're beginning to enjoy their lives outside of Bery's Place.
