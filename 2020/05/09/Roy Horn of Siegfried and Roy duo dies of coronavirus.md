(CNN) Roy Horn, one-half of the popular Las Vegas animal and magic act Siegfried and Roy, died Friday of complications from the coronavirus, according to his publicist. He was 75.

Roy Uwe Ludwig Horn and Siegfried Fischbacher began their upbeat performances in Europe, later becoming regulars in Las Vegas, where they performed for four decades.

"Roy was a fighter his whole life including during these final days," Fischbacher said in a statement. "I give my heartfelt appreciation to the team of doctors, nurses and staff at Mountain View Hospital who worked heroically against this insidious virus that ultimately took Roy's life."

Their revue ended after Horn was attacked on stage by a white tiger named Mantecore in October 2003, severing his spine.

Roy Horn appears st the Mirage Hotel before he was mauled by a white tiger in 2003.

The attack happened on Horn's 59th birthday, and an audience member told CNN at the time that Horn "looked like a rag doll in his mouth." Horn suffered massive blood loss and stroke, and required two surgeries.
