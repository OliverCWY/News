Heathrow Airport has said that any quarantine measures must be medically effective, meet public expectations and be deliverable by airports.

The comments come in response to the prospect of a 14-day quarantine being implemented for travellers arriving in the UK.

"We will continue to do everything we can to support the government in tackling the health crisis whilst keeping vital trading routes open for British businesses in every corner of the UK,” a spokesman said.

"Heathrow is more than just an airport, it is the heart that keeps economic blood flowing for this country and it is vital our industry has the ability to bounce back quickly when the UK is ready to build back Britain together."

Heathrow bosses said there needs to be a common international standard for health in aviation.
