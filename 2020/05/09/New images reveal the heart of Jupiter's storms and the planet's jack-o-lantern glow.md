(CNN) Jupiter is known for its massive storms, but trying to peer inside them requires teamwork by the Juno spacecraft, the Hubble Space Telescope and the ground-based Gemini North telescope in Hawaii. Collective observations from this dream team have produced stunning images and revealed what's happening inside Jupiter's giant, continuous storms.

The power of combining three different ways of observing Jupiter -- even a ground-based telescope on Earth that's millions of miles away -- lies in different wavelengths.

Hubble can observe Jupiter in visible and ultraviolet light while Gemini can capture observations in thermal infrared. Juno is poised to capture radio signals emanating from the lightning in Jupiter's storms. The radio signals are called "sferics" and "whistlers" that can be used to map lightning even beneath Jupiter's heavy clouds.

Sferics is short for atmospherics, while whistlers get their name from the whistling tone they made.

Hubble and Gemini provide high-resolution observations at a distance, which can be used to interpret Juno's close-up views of Jupiter.
