(CNN) Sometimes you don't know what you've got until it's gone.

And that became very clear this week as two former presidents -- George W. Bush and Barack Obama --showed a level of grace and class that has been missing for much of the last three-plus years, and especially over the last few months as the country (and the world) has battled coronavirus.

First came Bush with a video message for the country . "We are not partisan combatants," Bush said. "We're human beings, equally vulnerable and equally wonderful in the sight of God. We rise or fall together. And we're determined to rise."

He then added that he had seen an amazing spirit rise in the country in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks and that "I have no doubt, none at all, that this spirit of service and sacrifice is alive and well in America."

In response to that stirring reminder of our common humanity, President Donald Trump tweeted that Bush "was nowhere to be found in speaking up against the greatest Hoax in American history\!"
