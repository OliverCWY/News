(CNN) Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas got his hair cut Friday at a Texas salon whose owner was jailed this week for defying her state's stay-at-home order and reopening her business early.

"Hair salons & barbershops are open in TX today. Just got my hair cut for first time in 3 months at Salon ALa Mode to support Shelley Luther, who was wrongly imprisoned when she refused to apologize for trying to earn a living," the Texas Republican said on Twitter Friday.

"Glad Shelley is out of jail & her business is open\!" he added.

On Tuesday, Luther was found in civil and criminal contempt of court in Dallas for ignoring Texas' stay-at-home order, which prohibited her from operating her business until Friday. She was ordered to serve seven days in jail and to pay a fine of $500 for every day the salon stayed open.

"I have hairstylists that are going hungry because they'd rather feed their kids.
