If five years ago someone had said I wouldn’t eat a scrap of onion or garlic or my daily Granny Smith, I’d have told them exactly where to stick that apple. But after years of pregnancy-belly, stomach pains and military-like plans for toilet emergencies, I was diagnosed with IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) and put on the low-FODMAP diet, which alleviates symptoms in 70 percent of sufferers.

We don’t know why some people get IBS. About 12 percent of people in the UK experience it in any year, and it’s more common in women and people under 50 . Contributing factors include infections, stress and genetics, so it’s unsurprising that treatments vary – and it’s usually a lifelong condition. But it’s not all doom and gloom.

Could a diet that involves cutting out staples such as bread, milk and lots of fruits and vegetables work for me?
