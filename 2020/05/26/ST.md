正如新加坡一直在努力应对在其外国人在宿舍中迅速蔓延的冠状病毒爆发一样，拥有大量低薪移民工人的国家也正在努力解决类似问题。
在马来西亚，仅上周在吉隆坡郊外的八打灵再也，警察就围捕了200名无证工人，尽管官员们逐渐放宽了行动限制。
人们认为该国至少有500万农民工。
威尔士表示：“农民工被政府所依赖，他们从事危险的工作，而这些工作在这次危机中变得更加危险。”
尽管一些政府做出了承诺支持移民工人的承诺，但还有更多工作要做，以确保Covid-19不会在这些国家造成进一步的侵犯人权行为和给移民工人更大的痛苦。

Just as Singapore has struggled to deal with a coronavirus outbreak that spread quickly through its population of foreign workers in dormitories, countries with large numbers of low-wage migrant workers are grappling with similar issues.
In Malaysia, police rounded up 200 undocumented workers last week alone in Petaling Jaya, outside Kuala Lumpur, even as officials gradually ease movement restrictions.
The country is thought to have at least five million migrant workers.
"Migrant workers have been left aside by governments who have relied on them to do dangerous jobs that have become even more dangerous during this crisis," Mr Welsh said.
While some governments made promising commitments to support migrant workers, much more needs to be done to ensure Covid-19 will not result in further human rights violations and greater suffering for migrant workers in these countries.

新加坡-由于冠状病毒大流行导致全球需求下降以及国内断路器措施的预期影响，新加坡将陷入比今年早些时候的预测更严重的衰退。
MTI在新闻稿中说：“在这种背景下，新加坡经济的前景自三月以来进一步减弱。”
但它也指出了新加坡经济中的“韧性”。
在制造领域，由于医药和生物产品的生产，生物医学制造有望继续扩大。
在服务中，鉴于公司对IT和数字解决方案的弹性需求，预计信息和通信领域也将增长。

SINGAPORE - Singapore will sink into a deeper recession than earlier forecast this year amid the deterioration in global demand from the coronavirus pandemic as well as the expected impact of circuit breaker measures at home.
"Against this backdrop, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened further since March," MTI said in a press release.
But it also noted the “pockets of resilience” in the Singapore economy.
Within the manufacturing sector, biomedical manufacturing is expected to continue to expand, supported by the production of pharmaceutical and biological products.
Among services, the information and communications sector is also projected to grow given firms’ resilient demand for IT and digital solutions.

## 中国能否阻止与美国的关系自由落体？

中美关系处于自由落体状态。
近几个月来，Covid-19的影响加剧了摩擦领域。
其中包括美国及其西方盟国推动对冠状病毒起源的探索。随着中国人的内感的推定，一些政府和律师也采取了行动，要求北京为Covid-19的扩散向北京寻求赔偿-有时高达数万亿美元。

The relationship between China and the United States is in free fall.
In recent months, the impact of Covid-19 has added to the areas of friction.
Among them is the push by the US and its Western allies for a probe into the origins of the coronavirus; with the presumption of Chinese guilt, there is also the move by some governments and lawyers to seek compensation from Beijing - sometimes to the tune of trillions of dollars - for the spread of Covid-19.

悉尼（彭博社）-富裕的中国投资者发现，豪华房地产是避免冠状病毒经济影响的好地方。
澳大利亚钻石公司Black Diamondz的创始人莫妮卡·杜（Monika Tu）说：“这很平淡。”该公司迎合了中国的豪华房地产买家。
与此形成鲜明对比的是伦敦和纽约，在封锁之下，房地产市场仍然疲软。
祖尔卡里说，潜在的中国买家是在国家放宽边界后留在马来西亚的，他们在马来西亚放宽限制后开始查看房产。
富裕的中国买家也开始在家里购物，两个月前那里的封锁开始逐步解除。

SYDNEY (BLOOMBERG) - Rich Chinese investors are finding luxury real estate is a good hiding place from the economic fallout of the coronavirus.
"It's been flat-out," said Monika Tu, founder of Black Diamondz, an Australian company that caters to Chinese buyers of luxury real estate.
That's in contrast to London and New York where real estate remains sluggish amid lockdowns.
The potential Chinese buyers, who stayed in Malaysia when countries started to close their borders, began viewing properties after Malaysia eased restrictions, said Zulkhairi.
Affluent Chinese buyers are also starting to shop at home, where lockdowns began gradually lifting two months ago.

随着每日感染数量的减少，总理在计划周日到期之前解除了紧急状态。
最新一轮刺激使总刺激方案大大超过先前认捐的117.1万亿日元，并将于明天由内阁通过。
在东京，千叶，神奈川，Sa玉和北海道的其余五个县取消了该法令。
安倍晋三说：“日本已经以自己的方式设法在短短的1.5个月内控制了这一流行病。”
东京大学最近的一项研究表明，在500个样本中进行的抗体检测阳性率为0.6％。

With the number of daily infections on the decline, the PM lifted the state of emergency ahead of its planned expiry on Sunday.
The latest round of stimulus brings the total package well above the previously-pledged 117.1 trillion yen and is set to be passed by the Cabinet tomorrow.
The decree was lifted in the remaining five prefectures of Tokyo, Chiba, Kanagawa, Saitama and Hokkaido.
“Japan has, in its own way, managed to bring the epidemic under control in just 1½ months,” Mr Abe said.
In a recent study by the University of Tokyo, antibody tests in 500 specimens returned 0.6 per cent positives.

日内瓦（路透社）-世界卫生组织周一（5月25日）表示，如果冠状病毒感染下降的国家为阻止爆发而采取的措施为时过早，仍然可能面临“第二高峰”。
“当我们经典地谈论第二波时，我们通常指的是疾病本身会产生第一波，然后在几个月后复发。
对于许多国家来说，这可能会在几个月后成为现实。”
我们可能会在这波浪潮中达到第二个高峰。”
除非作为临床试验的一部分，否则WHO以前建议不要使用羟氯喹来治疗或预防冠状病毒感染。

GENEVA (REUTERS) - Countries where coronavirus infections are declining could still face an "immediate second peak" if they let up too soon on measures to halt the outbreak, the World Health Organisation said on Monday (May 25).
"When we speak about a second wave classically what we often mean is there will be a first wave of the disease by itself, and then it recurs months later.
And that may be a reality for many countries in a number of months' time," Ryan said.
We may get a second peak in this wave."
The WHO has previously recommended against using hydroxychloroquine to treat or prevent coronavirus infections, except as part of clinical trials.

华盛顿（法新社）-美国总统唐纳德·特朗普周一（5月25日）对媒体对他在阵亡将士纪念日周末打高尔夫球的负面报道感到愤怒，因为美国因冠状病毒大流行造成的死亡人数接近100,000。
