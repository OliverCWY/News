The key to brewing great coffee on the cheap is to choose the right kit for the type of coffee you drink.

Best methods for black coffee

The cafetière is the most versatile home-brewing method for black coffee, and gives a good flavour. Coarse coffee grinds should be immersed in hot water for 4 minutes, with occasional stirring, before being pressed to the bottom of the cafetière using a plunger. You can even make cold coffee in a cafetière: place the grinds and cold water in the jug and “leave it to brew in the fridge overnight, or for at least 15 hours, then plunge”, says Jordon. You can buy many sizes, so choose the right one for your family.

Filters are good for enhancing the flavours in lighter black coffee. Typically, the brewing is very easy: you pour hot water over coffee grinds, which sit in a filter over a jug or mug. Gravity does the hard work and the coffee drips out of the bottom of the filter. You can buy varying sizes of cone-shaped filters, which make anything from one cup to several. There’s a bit of practice needed for getting the right pouring technique to achieve even extraction, but once you’ve cracked it, it’s very simple and reliable. Kit recommends using this method to make cold-brew coffee, by sitting the cone over ice in a jug to cool as it drips.

An Aeropress is very versatile and Kit recommends them for taking on the go because of their small size (he even fits a mini coffee grinder inside). Be sure to use coarsely ground coffee.

Kit warns against using an espresso-style brewing method such as a moka pot to make black coffee, as it will taste best when all the water is used in the brewing process rather than hot water being added to a strong shot.

Best methods for espresso and milky coffee

“Most of the coffee drinks you get in a coffee shop are espresso-based”, says Kit. Lattes, flat whites and cappuccinos are made from espresso shots, using a specialist machine. It is impossible to replicate this drink without the proper kit, as it exerts a huge amount of pressure on the coffee. But there are a couple of ways to create a strong short coffee and these milky beverages at home.

An Aeropress is ideal for espresso. It’s all about pressure, much like with an espresso machine, though it uses a lot less force. Put fine coffee grinds and hot water into the device and (this is the key) press really, really hard. A metal filter, rather than a paper filter, may produce a more realistic imitation of an espresso, as some of the micro-grinds will pass through, creating a rich brew.

A moka pot (aka stovetop espresso maker) is also ideal for an espresso. In this three-chamber pot, boiling water turns to steam in the bottom section and filters through ground coffee in the middle area. This produces a strong coffee that travels through a spout into the top compartment, where it can be poured out. Some brewers don’t rate this method highly as the process isn’t very precise, but it still brews a great strong coffee that you can use in milky drinks, according to Gemma. She recommends starting with hot water (using oven gloves to screw the moka pot closed), as it will evaporate much more quickly, reducing the contact time between the coffee and boiling water (which can leave a bitter taste). She says you should avoid compressing the coffee, so that steam can rise through it quickly, and not let it boil once brewed, to avoid burning it. A moka pot will usually only make enough coffee for one drink.
