卡明斯先生说，他相信自己已经“合理”地在法律范围内行事。
他补充说，卡明斯先生的举止“合理”，并且“诚实正直，关心他人”，但工党和自由民主党人都指责这两个人有双重标准。
但是卡明斯先生告诉记者：“我认为我与众不同，我有一个规则，其他人有一个规则。”
代理自由民主党领导人爱德·戴维爵士敦促约翰逊解雇卡明斯先生，并补充说：“他拒绝礼貌道歉是对我们所有人的侮辱。

Mr Cummings said he believed he had acted "reasonably" and within the law.
He added that Mr Cummings had acted "reasonably" and with "integrity and care for others", but Labour and the Liberal Democrats accused both men of double standards.
But Mr Cummings told reporters: "I don't think I am so different and that there is one rule for me and one rule for other people."
Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey urged Mr Johnson to sack Mr Cummings, adding: "His refusal to have the decency to apologise is an insult to us all.

它是如此成功，以至于在短短三年内分配的数量就增加到了170万，而带有蔬菜产品的私人花园达到了500万。
胜利花园还不仅仅是食物：种植水果和蔬菜可以鼓舞士气并增强势头。
我们要复兴的是一种社区精神，而胜利花园从字面上说是我们在一起。
就像1930年代的胜利胜利传单传达了不断增长的信息一样，在线团体也通过传播植物智慧来帮助新的种植者。
第二次世界大战的胜利花园运动不仅有助于加强社区建设，还使受困于家中的人有机会为在第一线作战的人们做出贡献。

It was so successful that the number of allotments grew to 1.7 million in just three years, while private gardens with vegetable produce numbered five million.
Victory gardens were also not just about food: cultivating fruit and vegetables boosted morale and built momentum.
It is the sense of community spirit we want to revive – and a victory garden quite literally says we are in this together.
Just as the 1930s Dig for Victory leaflets relayed growing information, online groups are helping new growers by circulating plant wisdom.
The victory garden movement of the World Wars not only helped strengthen communities, but also gave home-bound individuals a chance to contribute to those fighting on the front line.

推崇雏菊另一个异想天开的超自然喜剧剧情在其时代之前很短，在上世纪90年代末持续了两个系列。
如果您是第一次看不到它，那么现在就值得挖掘：它仍然具有独特的魅力，这是您从未见过的最甜蜜，最病态的节目。
但是，经过60秒后，如果要让死者复活，就必须换来附近的另一条生命。
饱和的色彩，佩斯与安娜·弗里尔（Anna Friel）之间的甜蜜爱情故事，是他复活的初恋，以及古怪的边角人物合奏，令人振奋不已。
在美国的CW Seed和英国的Amazon Prime Video上可用。

Pushing DaisiesAnother series cut short well before its time, this whimsical, supernatural comedy-drama lasted two series in the late noughties.
If you didn’t see it first time around, it’s worth digging out now: it remains wonderfully unique, at once the sweetest and most morbid show you have never seen.
After those 60-seconds elapse, however, if the dead are to stay alive, another life nearby has to be taken in return.
With its saturated colours, sweet love story between Pace and Anna Friel as his reanimated first love, and ensemble of eccentric side characters, there is plenty to lift the spirits.
Available on CW Seed in the US and Amazon Prime Video in the UK.

由于受到冠状病毒的侵袭，德国航空公司受到了严重影响，并于4月关闭了廉价航空公司Germanwings。
但该交易仍需得到公司股东和欧盟委员会的批准。
作为救援计划的一部分，德国政府还将注入57亿欧元的无投票权资本，这被称为“沉默参与”。
航空分析师航空中心称，汉莎航空是欧洲客运量最大的国家，其次是法航-荷航。

The German airline has been severely affected by a decline in travel due to the coronavirus and closed its budget airline Germanwings in April.
But the deal still has to be approved by the firm's shareholders and the European Commission.
As part of the rescue package, the German government will also inject €5.7bn in non-voting capital, which is known as a "silent participation".
Lufthansa has the most passenger traffic in Europe, followed by Air France-KLM, according to aviation analysts, the Centre for Aviation.

北京在9月暂时封锁了Zoom的国际版本，使市场向包括阿里巴巴的DingTalk和腾讯支持的VooV在内的本地公司开放。
从那时起，两个大型的中国视频会议应用程序大大增加了其服务的规模和覆盖范围。
VooV是腾讯会议的国际版本，该会议于去年12月启动，目前可在印度，日本和新加坡等多个国家使用。
根据Zoom自己的数字，尽管它没有发布每日用户或注册用户的数字，但现在每天有3亿活跃的会议参与者。
来自DA Davidson的软件分析师Rishi Jaluria强调了他如何看待不同的应用程序试图占领这一市场。

Beijing temporarily blocked the international version of Zoom in September, leaving the market wide open to local players, including Alibaba's DingTalk and Tencent-backed VooV.
Since then two big Chinese video conferencing apps have significantly increased the size and reach of their services.
VooV is the international version of Tencent Meeting, which was launched in December last year, and is currently available in several countries including India, Japan and Singapore.
According to Zoom's own numbers it now has 300 million daily active meeting participants, although it does not publish figures on daily users or registered users.
Software analyst Rishi Jaluria from DA Davidson highlighted how he sees different apps trying to get a slice of this market.

为了帮助您提供有关如何管理此功能的见解，BBC Worklife正在从存档中更新一些我们最受欢迎的生产力故事。
帕金森在他的讽刺文章中以一位年长的女士给侄女写明信片的例子为例。
由于她与自己的时间无关，因此原本简单的任务将占用她一整天的时间。
“帕金森定律”自成一体，构成了帕金森多篇论文和一本书的基础，并在全球范围内进行了公开演讲。
但是，鲜为人知的是，帕金森的初衷并不是针对像我这样的老太太写信或记者，而是针对另一种效率低下的机构-英国公务员制度的官僚化。

To help provide insight on how to manage this, BBC Worklife is updating some of our most popular productivity stories from our archive.
In his somewhat satirical essay Parkinson uses the example of an elderly lady writing a postcard to her niece.
Since she has nothing else to do with her time, the otherwise simple task takes up her entire day.
‘Parkinson’s Law’ took on a life of its own, forming the basis of several more essays and a book by Parkinson, leading to public lectures around the world.
But what fewer people know is that Parkinson’s original intent was not to take aim at old lady letter-writers or journalists like me, but at a different kind of inefficiency – the bureaucratisation of the British Civil Service.

以便宜的价格冲泡优质咖啡的关键是针对所喝咖啡的类型选择正确的套件。
通常，冲泡非常容易：您将热水倒在咖啡壶上，咖啡壶放在壶或杯子的过滤器中。
Kit说：“浓缩咖啡和乳白色咖啡的最佳方法”
将细咖啡粉和热水放入设备中（这是关键），要非常非常用力。
这样会产生浓烈的咖啡，该咖啡通过壶嘴进入顶部隔室，可以在其中倒出。

The key to brewing great coffee on the cheap is to choose the right kit for the type of coffee you drink.
Typically, the brewing is very easy: you pour hot water over coffee grinds, which sit in a filter over a jug or mug.
Best methods for espresso and milky coffee“Most of the coffee drinks you get in a coffee shop are espresso-based”, says Kit.
Put fine coffee grinds and hot water into the device and (this is the key) press really, really hard.
This produces a strong coffee that travels through a spout into the top compartment, where it can be poured out.
