Pushing Daisies

Another series cut short well before its time, this whimsical, supernatural comedy-drama lasted two series in the late noughties. If you didn’t see it first time around, it’s worth digging out now: it remains wonderfully unique, at once the sweetest and most morbid show you have never seen. At its centre is Ned (Lee Pace), a piemaker who has an even more powerful ability than baking delicious pastry treats – with one touch he can bring the dead back to life and with a second one, send them back to death. This power comes in handy when he is solving crimes with private eye Emerson Cod (Chi McBride), waking people up, asking a few questions, and re-dead-ifying them in the space of a minute. After those 60-seconds elapse, however, if the dead are to stay alive, another life nearby has to be taken in return. With its saturated colours, sweet love story between Pace and Anna Friel as his reanimated first love, and ensemble of eccentric side characters, there is plenty to lift the spirits. Available on CW Seed in the US and Amazon Prime Video in the UK. (LW)
