1970年代后期，当非洲学生大量涌入时，中国才刚刚开始向世界开放。
《纽约时报》报道了中国学生与非洲人发生冲突后在南京举行的夜间抗议活动。
尼日利亚的一家广播电台说，中国学生“不忍看到非洲人”与中国女孩混在一起。
他说：“那时参加反非洲示威游行的人是大学生，这些学生在某种程度上嫉妒非洲学生。”
中国种族主义和西方种族主义一样吗？

When African students began arriving in significant numbers in the late 1970s, China was just beginning to open up to the world.
The New York Times reported on nightly protests in Nanjing after Chinese students clashed with Africans.
A Nigerian radio station said the Chinese students "could not bear to see Africans" mix with Chinese girls.
"The people who participated in anti-African demos then were university students, and those students were in some ways jealous of the African students," he says.
Is Chinese racism the same as Western racism?

纽约（CNN商业）维珍轨道公司周一从一架747飞机上发射了其两阶段轨道火箭的演示，经历了一次小小的失败。
新闻稿称，此次发射将使火箭“发射器一号”“首次在空中点燃其发动机”。
但是，火箭遇到了一个问题。
“我们已经确认飞机已经放行了，”维珍轨道航空发推文说。
该公司随后发推文称，火箭在其第一阶段飞行中遇到异常情况。

New York (CNN Business) Virgin Orbit experienced a hiccup Monday with the launch demo of its two-stage orbital rocket from a 747 aircraft.
The launch would have seen the rocket — Launcher One — "ignite its engine mid-air for the first time," according to a news release .
However, the rocket experienced an issue.
"We've confirmed a clean release from the aircraft," Virgin Orbit tweeted .
The company later tweeted that the rocket experienced an anomaly in its first-stage flight.

卡明斯的旅程引发了英国的丑闻，使约翰逊应对该国冠状病毒爆发的努力蒙上了阴影。
这位助手说，他没有事先询问总理他决定离开伦敦的决定。
当被问及在旅行之前是否应该向约翰逊询问时，卡明斯说：“我不知道……也许我应该。”
反对党工党在新闻发布会前的一份声明中说：“对多米尼克·卡明斯来说，没有一个规则，对英国人民来说，没有另一个规则。”
多米尼克·卡明斯（Dominic Cummings）只是使整个国家感到困惑，”影子司法部长戴维·拉米（David Lammy）补充说。

Cummings' journey has sparked a scandal in Britain that has clouded Johnson's attempts to deal with his country's coronavirus outbreak.
The aide said he did not ask the Prime Minister about his decision to travel outside of London beforehand.
When asked whether he should have checked with Johnson before making his journey, Cummings said: "I don't know ... maybe I should have."
"There cannot be one rule for Dominic Cummings and another for the British people," the opposition Labour Party said in a statement before his press conference.
Dominic Cummings just confused the entire nation," shadow justice secretary David Lammy added.

（CNN）夏威夷西北群岛现已灭绝的普瓦胡努火山有两个贫瘠的山峰，仅高出海平面约170英尺，看上去并不多。
尤其如此，因为在同一群岛中，冒纳凯阿火山和冒纳洛阿火山火山塔耸立在海拔13,000英尺以上的所有其他火山之上。
夏威夷马诺亚大学的科学家已经证明，外表可能具有欺骗性。
在《地球与行星科学快报》杂志上发表的一项新研究表明，普纳胡努火山是世界上最大的盾构火山，并获得了莫纳·洛阿（Mauna Loa）的头衔。
科学家对海床进行了调查，并使用定量模型确定了这座长约171英里，宽56英里的火山，是莫纳罗阿火山的两倍。

(CNN) With two barren peaks that rise only about 170 feet above sea level, the now extinct Pūhāhonu volcano in the Northwestern Hawaii Islands doesn't look like much.
This is especially true since in the same archipelago, Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa tower over every other volcano at over 13,000 feet above sea level.
Scientists at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa have proved that looks can be deceiving.
new study published in the Earth and Planetary Science Letters journal establishes that Pūhāhonu is the largest shield volcano in the world, taking Mauna Loa's title.
Scientists surveyed the ocean floor and used quantitative modeling to determine that the volcano, which is about 171 miles long and 56 miles wide, is twice the size of Mauna Loa.

Shimojima说：“我们在车间里敬拜上帝。” Shimojima从事武士剑的创作已有25年以上。
但是，在废除武士阶级（以及禁止携带公共武器）之后很长时间，工匠的古老生产技术仍然存在。
此后，尽管生产过程基本相同，但它们在日本社会中的作用发生了巨大变化。
他补充说：“我不认为日本剑本身会从这个世界上消失。”
“我相信日本武士刀的美丽在于其简单性-它的美学没有任何不必要的元素。

"We worship god in our workshop," says Shimojima, who has been crafting samurai swords for more than 25 years.
But long after the abolition of the samurai class (and the outlawing of public weapon-carrying), the artisans' ancient production techniques live on.
Their role in Japanese society has changed dramatically since then, though the production process remains largely the same.
"I do not believe that Japanese swords themselves will disappear from this world," he adds.
"I believe the beauty of a Japanese katana lies within its simplicity -- its aesthetics without any unnecessary elements.
