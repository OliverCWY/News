LONDON (AFP) – Britain’s death toll from the coronavirus has topped 32,000, according to an updated official count released Tuesday (May 5), pushing the country past Italy to become the second-most impacted after the United States.

国家电信委员会（NTC）下令ABS-CBN停止广播，“缺少法律要求的有效国会授权”。
自2016年上任以来，杜特尔特先生一直威胁要关闭ABS-CBN。
ABS-CBN的所有者在2月的国会听证会上向杜特尔特先生道歉。
杜特尔特先生接受道歉，但坚持认为网络的命运取决于国会。
他说：“我知道有许多电台是在临时授权下运作的……我们可以举出很多例子，NTC会为仍在申请特许经营权的人授予临时授权。”

The National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) ordered ABS-CBN to stop broadcasting "absent a valid congressional franchise as required by law".
Mr Duterte has been threatening to shut down ABS-CBN since he took office in 2016.
ABS-CBN's owners, in congressional hearings in February, apologised to Mr Duterte.
Mr Duterte accepted the apology but insisted that the network's fate was up to Congress.
"I know for a fact that there are many stations operating on a provisional authority… We can cite many instances when the NTC granted a provisional authority for those still applying for their franchises," he said.

孟买（路透社）-德里警方周二（5月5日）正在调查一个网上聊天小组，该小组对强奸行为轻描淡写，并在社交媒体上大肆抨击性侵犯，其中一名少年男孩遭到了质疑。
一个名为“ bois更衣室”的Instagram聊天组是Twitter印度上最受欢迎的话题标签，许多推文使用该组的屏幕截图突出显示有关妇女，性别歧视或受害人的贬损言论。
他说，在群聊中对其他人的调查正在进行中，涉及违反各种法律，包括传播淫秽材料和侮辱妇女的谦虚。
拥有Instagram的Facebook代表说，它“不允许煽动性暴力或剥削任何人，特别是妇女和年轻人的行为”。
另一个Twitter用户＃tripathiharsh02写道：“女性的目标必须停止，而这只能通过教育青年来完成。”

MUMBAI (REUTERS) - Delhi police were on Tuesday (May 5) investigating an online chat group that made light of gang-rape and caused a backlash on social media over trivialising sexual assault, with one teenage boy questioned.
An Instagram chat group called "bois locker room" was the top trending hashtag on Twitter India, with many tweets using screenshots from the group to highlight derogatory comments made about women, sexism or victim blaming.
He said investigations into other people in the group chat were ongoing relating to breaches of various laws including transmitting obscene material and insulting the modesty of women.
A representative for Facebook, which owns Instagram, said it did "not allow behaviour that promotes sexual violence or exploits anyone, especially women and young people".
"Objectification of women must stop and it can only be done by educating youth," wrote another Twitter user \#tripathiharsh02.

珀廷格在预先录制的演讲中说：“当政府镇压小胆的行为时，大胆的行为随之而来。”这是弗吉尼亚大学米勒中心视频和互联网音频上预先录制的讲话。
特朗普先生在今年早些时候淡化了其严厉性，美国已经为此付出了代价，成为受灾最严重的国家，感染人数超过120万人，死亡人数约69,000。
在这场大流行病的口水战中，华盛顿和北京之间的关系处于自1979年关系正常化以来的最低潮。
对于北京而言，特朗普先生和美国政界人士一直在故意煽动反华情绪，攻击世界卫生组织，并要求进行国际调查，以转移对付禽流感疫情的注意力。
皮尤研究中心的一项新调查发现，约66％的美国人对中国持不利看法。

"When small acts of bravery are stamped out by governments, big acts of bravery follow," Mr Pottinger said in a pre-recorded speech delivered by video at the University of Virginia's Miller Centre and by audio on the Internet.
Mr Trump played down its severity for weeks early this year and the US has paid the price, becoming the hardest hit country with more than 1.2 million infected and about 69,000 deaths.
Amid the escalating war of words over the pandemic, relations between Washington and Beijing are at their lowest ebb since ties were normalised in 1979.
For Beijing, Mr Trump and US politicians have been deliberately fanning anti-Chinese sentiment, attacking the World Health Organisation and demanding an international inquiry to divert attention from America's fumbling when dealing with the outbreak.
A new Pew Research Centre survey found that about 66 per cent of Americans had an unfavourable view of China.

北京（彭博社）-中国驻英国大使刘晓明表示，要求重新建立两国关系的英国政治人物有可能使两国关系中毒。
他在周二（5月5日）的网络研讨会上说，在反冠状病毒大流行的斗争中，反华言论有可能破坏国际团结。
“如果他们放任自流，将危及中英共同努力，乃至最需要的国际团结。”
刘永昌说，那些国会议员“不代表”政府，企业和公众的观点。
刘锦涛说：“我最后要看到的是英国出于国家安全考虑而吓foreign外国投资者。”

BEIJING (BLOOMBERG) - China's Ambassador to Britain, Mr Liu Xiaoming, said British politicians who have called for a reset of ties between the two nations risk poisoning the relationship.
Anti-China rhetoric is in danger of undermining international solidarity in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, he said in a webinar on Tuesday (May 5).
"If they go unchecked, they will poison the China-UK joint effort, and even international solidarity just as it's needed most."
Those MPs "do not represent" the views of government, businesses and the general public, Mr Liu said.
"The last thing I would want to see is the UK scaring away foreign investors" over national security concerns, Mr Liu said.

吉隆坡-马来西亚反腐败委员会（MACC）正在调查几家由马来西亚卫生部直接任命的供应Covid-19相关设备的公司。
一位消息人士告诉《海峡时报》：“ MACC将审查根据紧急采购程序完成的承包商的任命程序。”
据悉，合同涉及购买Covid-19测试套件，个人防护设备（PPE）和口罩。
马来西亚贪污破坏者的调查是两个月大的佩里卡丹国家政府首次公开获悉的调查之一。
大多数医院设备，例如呼吸机，实验室等，都需要安装，调试和进行维护的专业知识。”

KUALA LUMPUR - Several companies directly appointed by Malaysia's Health Ministry to supply Covid-19-related equipment are being probed by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC).
"The MACC will be scrutinising the appointment process of the contractors which was done under the emergency procurement procedures," a source told the Straits Times.
It was learnt that the contracts involve the purchase of Covid-19 test kits, personal protective equipment (PPE) and face masks.
The probe by Malaysia's graftbusters is one of the first publicly known involving the two-month old Perikatan Nasional government.
Most hospital equipment such as ventilators, laboratories and such require expertise to install, commission and carry out maintenance," the source added.

一些老师最终拜访了家中的学生以进行日常教学。
自3月底以来，初中学生Indriyani Safitri一直在科莫多岛上与多达7个朋友一起在家学习。
但是最令她困扰的是老师的缺席，后者在WhatsApp上为学生设置了作业。
大多数学生还说，由于老师们在紧迫的期限内分配大量的作业，他们感到很累。
但是，在马杜拉岛的苏梅涅普，小学老师阿凡·法特赫拉曼（Avan Fathurrahman）采取了一种即用的方法。

Some teachers have ended up visiting students in their homes for daily lessons.
Junior high school student Indriyani Safitri has been studying at home on Komodo island with up to seven of her friends since the end of March.
But what bothers her most is the absence of the teacher, who sets homework for her students on WhatsApp.
A majority of the students also said they were tired because of the amount of homework assigned by the teachers with tight deadlines.
But, in Sumenep, Madura island, elementary school teacher Avan Fathurrahman, has taken an out-of-the-box approach.
