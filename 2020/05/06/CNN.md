（CNN）一位领先的流行病学家在英国《每日电讯报》报道他违反了他帮助制定的封锁规则后，于周二辞去了英国政府关于冠状病毒反应的建议。
尼尔·弗格森（Neil Ferguson）教授位于伦敦帝国理工学院，是英国政府“呆在家里”战略的建筑师之一，并且是英国冠状病毒应急科学咨询小组（SAGE）的杰出成员。 。
弗格森教授在给CNN的一份声明中说，他接受他犯了“错误的判断，并采取了错误的行动方针”，因此退出了他对SAGE的参与。
他说：“我坚信自己是免疫的，已经检测出冠状病毒阳性，并在出现症状后将近两周完全隔离了自己。”
“对于继续需要社会隔离来控制这种毁灭性流行病的明确信息遭到破坏，我深感遗憾。”

(CNN) A leading epidemiologist who advised the UK government on its coronavirus response resigned from his government post on Tuesday, after the Telegraph newspaper reported he broke the lockdown rules he helped shape.
Professor Neil Ferguson, who is based at Imperial College in London, is one of the architects of the UK government stay-at-home strategy and was a prominent member of Britain's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) which has been spearheading the coronavirus response.
In a statement to CNN, Professor Ferguson said he accepted he made "an error of judgement and took the wrong course of action," and had therefore stepped back from his involvement in SAGE.
"I acted in the belief that I was immune, having tested positive for coronavirus and completely isolated myself for almost two weeks after developing symptoms," he said.
"I deeply regret any undermining of the clear messages around the continued need for social distancing to control this devastating epidemic."

## 研究称，到2070年，数十亿人可能生活在对人类来说太热的地区

一项新的研究发现，如果地球在未来50年内继续以目前的水平变暖，那么多达30亿人将生活在对人类来说太热的地区。
几千年来，人类一直生活在狭窄的“气候小生境”中，那里的平均气温是社会繁荣发展的理想之地，而且条件有利于种植粮食和饲养牲畜。
在周一《美国国家科学院院刊》上发表的调查结果中，一个国际考古学家，气候科学家和生态学家团队表示，如果以目前的速度继续捕集温室气体，到2070亿人将生活在比过去6,000年使生活蓬勃发展的那些更热。
研究发现，每升温1°C（1.8°F），就有10亿人要么不得不迁移到较凉的地区，要么必须适应极端的高温条件。
华盛顿大学考古学家蒂姆·科勒（Tim Kohler）也是该研究的合著者，他说，这些发现可以被视为最坏的情况或“如果不改变自己的方式会发生什么”的“一切照旧”情况”。

Hong Kong (CNN) If the planet continues to warm at current levels over the next 50 years, up to 3 billion people could be living in areas that are too hot for humans, a new study has found.
For thousands of years, humans have lived within a narrow "climate niche" where average temperatures are ideal for society to flourish, and conditions favorable to grow food and keep livestock.
In findings published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday, an international team of archaeologists, climate scientists and ecologists said that if heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current pace, by 2070 billions of people will be living in conditions hotter than those that have allowed life to thrive for the past 6,000 years.
For every 1°C (1.8°F) of warming, 1 billion people will either have to migrate to cooler regions or adapt to extreme heat conditions, the study found.
Tim Kohler, an archaeologist at the University of Washington and co-author of the study said that these findings can be viewed as a worst case or "business-as-usual" scenario of "what could happen if we don't change our ways."

TikTok紧紧抓住了这一时机，推出了诸如“ \#HappyAtHome”之类的乐观标签，该标签已经看到许多用户用其父母来制作TikTok视频。
但是，来自Douyin和TikTok用户的应用内收入不仅是零钱。
Sensor Tower的分析师Randy Nelson说，Doouin和TikTok的收入“现在正在直线上升”。
Sensor Tower认为TikTok和Douyin本质上是同一应用程序，理由是品牌，营销和用户体验的相似之处。
但是现在，“因为所有人都在谈论TikTok，所以这些品牌实际上是在瞄准有影响力的人，并在TikTok上做广告，”她说。

TikTok has seized on the moment, pushing upbeat hashtags such as "\#HappyAtHome," which has seen many users rope their parents into doing TikTok videos.
But the in-app revenue it gets from Douyin and TikTok users is more than just chump change.
Douyin and TikTok revenue "is skyrocketing now," said Randy Nelson, an analyst with Sensor Tower.
Sensor Tower views TikTok and Douyin as essentially the same app, citing the similarities in branding, marketing and user experience.
But now, "because everyone is talking about TikTok, the brands are really targeting influencers and doing ads on TikTok," she said.

（CNN）由于Covid-19的科学和医学信息经常变化，因此我们的国家需要适应性强的指南来安全地敲响今年秋天的校铃。
但是孩子们很有韧性，他们仍将在尽可能安全的环境中学习和社交。
尽管让年轻的小学儿童戴着口罩可能会引起自己的问题，因为年幼的孩子在戴口罩时往往会多触摸他们的脸，并且缺乏正确戴上和脱下口罩的技能。
对于中学生，高中生，教师和学校工作人员，戴口罩将在减少传播中起重要作用。

Dr. Tanya Altmann is a pediatrician, spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics, school physician at Viewpoint School in Southern California and mom of three school-age boys.
(CNN) Because Covid-19 scientific and medical information changes frequently, our nation is going to need adaptable guidelines to safely ring the school bell this fall.
But kids are resilient, and they will still learn and socialize in as safe as an environment as possible.
Having young elementary school kids wear masks though can pose its own issues as young kids tend to touch their face more when they wear masks and lack skills to properly put masks on and take off.
For middle school and high school students, teachers and school staff, wearing face masks will play an important role in decreasing transmission.

（CNN）科学家早就知道，我们的大脑需要睡眠才能回顾当天的事件并将其转移到更长期的记忆中。
但是，人们对大脑存储记忆的确切方式知之甚少。
他补充说：“使用脑机接口是学习记忆的一种令人兴奋的方式，因为它可以记录脑细胞活动模式，然后在以后寻找那些确切的模式。”
Jarosiewicz说，使用这种技术研究睡眠中的大脑运动的原因是“这项研究是前所未有的”。
他希望，“未来的研究将有助于弄清哪些特定阶段的睡眠-深度睡眠，快速眼动睡眠-其中记忆重现最频繁发生。”

(CNN) Scientists have long known our brains need sleep to review the day's events and transfer them into longer-term memories.
But the exact way in which the brain stores our memories is poorly understood.
"Using a brain-computer interface is an exciting way to study memory since it can record brain cell activity patterns and then look for those exact patterns later," he added.
The use of such technology to study brain movements during sleep is why "this study is unprecedented," Jarosiewicz said.
Hopefully, he said, "future studies will help clarify which specific stages of sleep -- deep sleep, REM sleep -- in which memory replay occurs most frequently."

（CNN）美国和英国星期二发布了新的咨询性警告，警告正在对与冠状病毒反应有关的组织进行网络攻击，包括医疗保健机构，制药公司，学术界，医学研究组织和地方政府。
“大流行可能已经对APT参与者提出了更多要求，以收集与COVID-19有关的信息。
例如，参与者可能寻求获取有关国家和国际医疗政策的情报，或获取有关COVID-19相关研究的敏感数据。”
APT通常是外国政府赞助的黑客组织，周一的警报表明供应链可能特别脆弱。
“行动者将供应链视为薄弱的一环，他们可以利用它们来获得更好的受保护目标。

(CNN) The United States and United Kingdom issued a new advisory Tuesday warning of ongoing cyberattacks against organizations involved in the coronavirus response, including health care bodies, pharmaceutical companies, academics, medical research organizations and local government.
"The pandemic has likely raised additional requirements for APT actors to gather information related to COVID-19.
For example, actors may seek to obtain intelligence on national and international healthcare policy or acquire sensitive data on COVID-19 related research," the advisory says.
APTs are generally hacking groups sponsored by foreign governments and Monday's alert suggests that supply chains may be especially vulnerable.
"Actors view supply chains as a weak link that they can exploit to obtain access to better protected targets.

Most often the main figure in Vermeer's paintings is a woman, She is usually near a window, and the "props" are sparse and simple.

在有Anthony Fauci博士之前，有华盛顿卫生专员Thomas Tuttle博士，他带领该州度过了1918年毁灭性的流感大流行。
托马斯·塔特尔（Thomas Tuttle）博士是一位带眼镜的医师，他对结束1918年流感大流行的建议与安东尼·富奇（Anthony Fauci）博士在2020年分享的指导意见十分相似。
安东尼·福西（Anthony Fauci）博士在1月份（即大流行之前两个月）就发出了关于无症状冠状病毒传播的警报。

Before there was Dr. Anthony Fauci , there was Dr. Thomas Tuttle, a Washington health commissioner who shepherded the state through the devastating 1918 influenza pandemic.
Dr. Thomas Tuttle was a bespectacled physician whose advice for ending the 1918 influenza pandemic closely mirrors the guidance Dr. Anthony Fauci has shared in 2020.
Dr. Anthony Fauci sounded alarms about asymptomatic transmission of the coronavirus in January, two months before it would become a pandemic.

## 历史上最致命的空袭发生在第二次世界大战期间的东京，您可能从未听说过

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
这次空袭后来估计是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

## 为了安全起见，他们被送到庇护所。相反，这些妇女说她们遭到了性虐待

但是，美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）采访了包括帕特里夏（Patricia）在内的五名十几岁左右的女性，他们声称格拉泽（Glaser）在Bery's Place对其进行了性和情感虐待。
当女孩们反对时，他们说格拉泽会威胁要把他们赶出去。
一些幸存者说，格拉瑟（Glaser）介绍自己是一名医生，但是支持检方的律师告诉CNN，他是物理治疗师-不是合格的医生。
Dilen去年2月在Bery's Place进行的一次警察突袭中被警察盘问而被捕，随后被释放。
但至少现在，他们说，他们开始在贝里故居之外享受生活。

But five women in their late teens and early twenties interviewed by CNN, including Patricia, allege that Glaser sexually and emotionally abused them at Bery's Place.
When the girls objected, they say Glaser would threaten to cast them out on the streets.
Some survivors say Glaser introduced himself as a doctor, but lawyers supporting the prosecution told CNN that he is a physiotherapist -- not a qualified physician.
Dilen was arrested for questioning by police last February during a police raid at Bery's Place, and later released.
But for now, at least, they say they're beginning to enjoy their lives outside of Bery's Place.
