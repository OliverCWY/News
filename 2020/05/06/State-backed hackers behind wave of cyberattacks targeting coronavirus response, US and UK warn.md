(CNN) The United States and United Kingdom issued a new advisory Tuesday warning of ongoing cyberattacks against organizations involved in the coronavirus response, including health care bodies, pharmaceutical companies, academics, medical research organizations and local government.

These malicious actors "frequently target organizations in order to collect bulk personal information, intellectual property and intelligence that aligns with national priorities," according to the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).

"The pandemic has likely raised additional requirements for APT actors to gather information related to COVID-19. For example, actors may seek to obtain intelligence on national and international healthcare policy or acquire sensitive data on COVID-19 related research," the advisory says.

APTs are generally hacking groups sponsored by foreign governments and Monday's alert suggests that supply chains may be especially vulnerable. "Actors view supply chains as a weak link that they can exploit to obtain access to better protected targets. CISA and NCSC have seen 'APT' actors scanning the external web sites of targeted companies looking for vulnerabilities in unpatched software," according to the advisory.

The new warning comes after CNN reported last month that the Trump administration is pointing the finger at China for attempting to steal coronavirus research amid a growing wave of cyberattacks by nation states and criminal groups on US government agencies and medical institutions leading the pandemic response.
