He told reporters the task force may hand over US pandemic response to be led on an "agency-by-agency level" at the end of May or early June.
In a briefing with reporters on Tuesday, Mr Pence was asked about a report that the task force would soon wind down.

## 冠状病毒：多少新闻太多？

### Coronavirus: How much news is too much?

戴维斯解释说：“焦虑着眼于可能性，并专注于这种可能性，并放大了可能性，而不是可能性。”
戴维斯说，有些人在暴露于过多的冠状病毒信息后会“关闭并变得无动于衷”，而是转向其他刺激性和潜在危险的刺激源，例如过多的酒精或食物。
当您无法关闭时，还有相当一部分人出于专业原因发现自己被新闻周期所消耗的时间比平时多。
对于许多人来说，这是在他们在家工作并管理工作与私人生活之间模糊的界限时发生的。
治疗师约翰·保罗·戴维斯（John-Paul Davies）说，他目前的许多客户（他现在以数字方式看到他们）是那些“突然必须掌握最新动态”的人，或者是花很多时间与受灾最重的人交谈通过冠状病毒。

“Anxiety looks at the possible and focuses on that and amplifies that, rather than the probable,” explains Davies.
Davies says some people “switch off and become apathetic” after being exposed to too much coronavirus information, and instead turn to alternative and potentially dangerous sources of stimulation, such as too much alcohol or food.
When you can’t switch offThere’s also a sizable minority who are finding themselves consumed by the news cycle more than usual for professional reasons.
For many, this is happening while they are working from home and managing blurred boundaries between their work and private lives.
Therapist John-Paul Davies says a number of his current clients (who he now sees digitally) are those who “suddenly have to be on top of the latest developments” or are spending a lot of time speaking to those who’ve been hit hardest by the coronavirus.

当德国人最终被送到布鲁尼岛检疫站的拘留营时，后备役人员需要做一些解释。
布鲁尼岛过去是，现在仍然是一个美丽的地方，被原始森林所覆盖，周围是鱼群般的水域。
但是，直到1856年Cox家族的到来，欧洲才开始对隔离站进行占领。
他们经常在隔离站边界外工作，并建造了自己的建筑物，包括远离主要基地的几个营地。
布鲁尼岛检疫站之友的研究员兼委员会成员凯西·邓科姆（Kathy Duncombe）表示，他们最大的挑战之一就是无聊。

The reservists had some explaining to do, while the Germans were eventually sent to an internment camp at Bruny Island Quarantine Station.
Bruny Island was, and still is, a beautiful place covered in native forest and surrounded by waters teeming with fish.
However, European occupation of the Quarantine Station site didn’t occur until 1856, with the arrival of the Cox family.
They often worked outside the Quarantine Station boundaries and constructed their own buildings, including several camps well away from the main base.
According to Kathy Duncombe, researcher and committee member of the Friends of Bruny Island Quarantine Station, one of their biggest challenges was boredom.

意大利和英国都记录了冠状病毒检测呈阳性的人的死亡。
但他说，进行这样的比较存在一些警告，包括英国人口比意大利多约10％。
每个国家的测试制度也不同，迄今为止，意大利进行的测试要多于英国。
如果以人均人口数来算，意大利的情况仍然会更糟-尽管只是这样。
Raab先生在10号新闻发布会上说，目前在英国已有1,383,842项针对冠状病毒的检测，包括昨天的84,806项检测。

Both Italy and the UK record the deaths of people who have tested positive for coronavirus.
But he said there are caveats in making such a comparison, including the UK population being about 10% larger than Italy's.
Each country also has different testing regimes, with Italy conducting more tests than the UK to date.
If you count cases per head of population, Italy still comes out worse - although only just.
There have now been 1,383,842 tests for coronavirus across the UK, including 84,806 tests yesterday, Mr Raab told the No 10 briefing.

视频BBC新闻阿拉伯人的一项调查分析了航班跟踪数据和开源素材，这些视频显示了伊朗最大的航空公司Mahan Air在政府禁止飞行的情况下如何继续飞行，并促进了Covid-19在中东的传播。
在1月下旬至3月底之间，Mahan Air往返了伊朗，伊拉克，阿拉伯联合酋长国和叙利亚的数百趟航班。
所有这些国家都允许马汉航空降落。
他们这样做是在他们自己禁止从伊朗进行例行航班的同时。
马汉航空因与强大的伊朗革命卫队的联系而受到美国的制裁。

VideoAn investigation by BBC News Arabic has analysed flight tracking data and open source footage which shows how Iran's largest airline - Mahan Air - continued to fly while government flight bans were in place, and contributed to the spread of Covid-19 in the Middle East.
Mahan Air ran hundreds of flights to and from Iran, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and Syria between late January and the end of March.
All these countries gave Mahan Air permission to land.
And they did so while their own bans on routine flights from Iran were in place.
Mahan Air is sanctioned by the US for its links to the powerful Iranian Revolutionary Guard.

除非温室气体排放量下降，否则许多人的平均温度将高于29摄氏度。
该研究的合著者蒂姆·列顿（Tim Lenton）告诉英国广播公司：“该研究有望使气候变化更加人性化”。
根据这项研究，人口集中在狭窄的气候带中，大多数人居住在平均温度约为11至15摄氏度的地方。
少数人居住在平均温度为20-25摄氏度的地区。
人口增长预计将在已经很热的地方，主要是撒哈拉以南非洲，从而使普通人的温度上升。

Unless greenhouse gas emissions fall, large numbers of people will experience average temperatures hotter than 29C.
Co-author of the study Tim Lenton told the BBC: "The study hopefully puts climate change in a more human terms".
According to the study, human populations are concentrated into narrow climate bands with most people residing in places where the average temperature is about 11-15C.
A smaller number of people live in areas with an average temperature of 20-25C.
Population growth is projected to be in already hot places, mostly sub-Saharan Africa, so that shifts the average person to a hotter temperature.

迪士尼董事长鲍勃·伊格（Bob Iger）表示：“我毫不怀疑我们会解决这个问题，但这需要一些时间。”

Every part of its business was affected by coronavirus, nearly wiping out profits for the quarter.
Disney chairman Bob Iger said the firm was facing "unprecedented" challenges but he was confident of recovery.
The firm is already planning to open its Shanghai park on 11 May.
Chief executive Bob Chapek said the company would take a "phased approach", requiring advance reservations to limit attendance.
"I have no doubt that we will get through this but it will take some time," Disney chairman Bob Iger said.

此举是继去年该州通过的具有里程碑意义的法律之后，该法律为所谓的演出工人澄清了规则。
这家交通巨头和规模较小的竞争对手Lyft去年在讨论中时，一直未能成功反对加利福尼亚州的法律，称这将降低驾驶员所重视的灵活性。
“ Uber和Lyft通过使用应用程序与驾驶员进行沟通的事实并不会突然剥夺驾驶员作为雇员的基本权利。”
优步和Lyft还敦促国会将其司机纳入联邦政府的冠状病毒救助计划中，包括扩大失业救济金。

The move follows the landmark law the state passed last year to clarify rules for so-called gig-workers.
The transportation giant and smaller rival Lyft had unsuccessfully opposed California's law when it was under discussion last year, saying it would reduce flexibility valued by drivers.
"The fact that Uber and Lyft communicate with their drivers by using an app does not suddenly strip drivers of their fundamental rights as employees."
Uber and Lyft have also pushed Congress to include their drivers in the federal government's coronavirus relief, including expanded unemployment benefits.

在线预订平台Airbnb计划裁员25％，原因是该公司正努力应对因大流行而导致的急速旅行。
老板布赖恩·切斯基（Brian Chesky）说，目前尚不清楚旅行何时返回或何时返回。
Airbnb的举动是旅游业正在为长期低迷做准备的最新迹象。
Airbnb的计划裁员将影响公司7500名员工中的1900名。
该公司最近从投资者那里筹集了20亿美元（16亿英镑），以度过低迷时期。该公司表示，它将为受影响的员工提供至少14周的薪酬。

Boss Brian Chesky said it's not clear when travel will return or what it will look like when it does.
The move at Airbnb is the latest sign the travel industry is preparing for a prolonged downturn.
Airbnb's planned cuts will affect about 1,900 people out of the company's 7,500 staff.
The company, which recently raised $2bn (£1.6bn) from investors to get it through the downturn, said it will provide at least 14 weeks of pay to affected staff.

我坚定地抵御微风，站在苏格兰和英国边界西南端的标志处调查现场。
人们认为，可争议土地是英国最后的大领土分区。
苏格兰和英格兰之间的界线是根据1237年的《约克条约》建立的。
正如格雷厄姆·罗伯（Graham Robb）在他2018年的书《有争议的土地：苏格兰和英格兰之间的失落世界》中所写的那样，它“可能是欧洲最古老的国界”。
这座人造堤防，今天几乎看不到，是一个三英里半长的屏障，最终将可耕地分成两部分。

Standing firm against a determined breeze, I was surveying the scene from what marks the south-western end of the border between Scotland and England.
The Debatable Lands is believed to have been the last great territorial division in Britain.
The line between Scotland and England was established with the Treaty of York in 1237.
As Graham Robb writes in his 2018 book, The Debatable Land: The Lost World Between Scotland and England, it is “probably the oldest national boundary in Europe”.
This man-made embankment, little of which is visible today, was a three-and-a-half-mile-long barrier that finally divided the Debatable Lands in two.

色情的影响，俱乐部的摸索和工作中的厌恶女性的取笑已经引起了广泛的争论。
活动范围从点燃烛光的晚宴到关于外卖炸玉米饼的辩论或在空办公室工作后的简单咖啡晚会。
其他人则作为非正式的支持会议，使男人专注于自己当前的关系和心理健康。
平等的女性联合创始人艾达·奥斯滕森（IdaÖstensson）在Facebook上发布消息称，男人应该考虑让自己的私人团体聚在一起讨论这个问题。

Few topics are off-limits at the male-only meetings attended by Swedish entrepreneur and environmentalist Johannes Wretljung Persson.
The impact of porn, groping in clubs and misogynist banter at work have already been widely debated.
Events have ranged from candle-lit dinner parties to debates over take-away tacos or simple coffee evenings after work in empty offices.
Others serve as more informal support sessions in which men focus on their own current relationships and mental health.
The female co-founder of Make Equal, Ida Östensson, posted on Facebook that men should consider getting their own private groups together to discuss the problem.

如您所料，给某人一个氧气罐来呼吸会逆转这些变化。
您不会期望的是，如果氧气罐是假的，那么您可以实现完全相同的目的–它是空的。
“血液中没有氧气，体内没有氧气，但是您可以获得与真实氧气完全相同的效果。
真正的答案是我们不清楚。
任何职业运动员都会告诉您，他们对获胜的信念在成功中扮演着重要的角色，研究表明，通过改变他们的期望，安慰剂效应可以对他们走多快或走多远产生强大影响。

As you might expect, giving someone an oxygen tank to breathe from will reverse these changes.
What you wouldn’t expect is that you can achieve exactly the same thing if the oxygen tank is a fake – it’s empty.
“There is no oxygen in the blood, there is no oxygen in the body, but you can get the very same effect as real oxygen.
The real answer is we don’t know.”Harder, faster, strongerWe normally hear about the placebo effect in a medical context.
Any professional athlete will tell you that their beliefs about winning play a huge role in success, and research suggests that by modifying their expectations, the placebo effect can have a powerful impact on how fast or how far they can go.

树木具有多种特性，可以帮助减少城市空气污染，世界各地的城市都在寻求利用它们。
同时，中国的河北省（北京的故乡）一直在研究植物的“绿色项链”，以帮助减少首都周边工厂的污染。
虽然树木通常可以有效减少空气污染，但它并不像您在城市空间中拥有的树木越多，空气越好。
为了最大程度地改善街道或城市的空气质量，必须选择合适的树。
树木可以直接或间接地改善空气质量。

Trees have a remarkable range of traits that can help reduce urban air pollution, and cities around the world are looking to harness them.
Meanwhile, China’s Hebei Province, home to Beijing, has been working on a “green necklace” of plants that could help reduce pollution from factories that surround the capital.
While trees are generally effective at reducing air pollution, it isn’t as simple as the more trees you have in an urban space, the better the air will be.
To make the most difference in air quality in a street or city, it has to be the right tree for the job.
Trees can improve air quality in direct and indirect ways.

这位害羞但才华横溢的厨师在美国戈登·拉姆齐（Gordon Ramsay）的电视节目《地狱厨房》（Hell's Kitchen）中闯入了决赛。
他了解到，地狱厨房将向公众开放，每次服务后将淘汰一名参赛者。
尽管拉姆齐（Ramsay）在厨房中扮演着可怕的角色，但迈克尔说，他是厨房外面的对立面。
迈克尔出现在地狱厨房之前的几年，他因脊柱侧弯而接受了背部手术，并被处方使用了强大的阿片类镇痛药以使其康复。

The shy but talented cook had made it through to the final on the first US series of Gordon Ramsay's show Hell's Kitchen.
He learned that Hell's Kitchen would be open to the public and one contestant would be eliminated after each service.
Despite Ramsay's fearsome persona in the kitchen, Michael says he was the polar opposite outside of it.
A couple of years before he appeared on Hell's Kitchen, Michael had back surgery for scoliosis and was prescribed powerful opioid painkillers for his recovery.
