Tesla TSLA "I am selling almost all physical possessions. Will own no house," the billionaireand SpaceX founder said on Twitter Friday. When a follower asked why, Musk responded : "Freedom."

The listings and Musk's comments about selling his belongings come days after he slammed coronavirus stay-at-home orders in an expletive-laced statement during Tesla's quarterly earnings call. Health officials have said such orders, which forced Tesla to temporarily halt work at its Northern California manufacturing facility, are important to slowing the spread of the virus.
