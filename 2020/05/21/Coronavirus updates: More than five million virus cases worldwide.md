A two-day-old baby has become the youngest person to die with coronavirus in South Africa after being born prematurely to a mother that tested positive.

It is the country's first neonatal death.

Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said the premature baby had lung problems and required ventilation immediately after birth.

“The mother had tested positive for Covid-19 and the child subsequently tested positive as well. It is important to appreciate the complexities of the underlying conditions [of] being born prematurely,” he said.

South Africa, which has the highest number of infections in Africa, reported 27 new deaths on Wednesday bringing total fatalities to 339.

There were 803 new cases, taking the total to 18,003.
