卫生部长兹维利·姆赫兹（Zweli Mkhize）说，早产儿患有肺部疾病，出生后需要立即换气。
“母亲的Covid-19检测呈阳性，孩子随后也检测呈阳性。
意识到早产的潜在条件的复杂性很重要，”他说。
南非是非洲感染率最高的国家，周三报告有27例新死亡，致死总数为339人。

Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said the premature baby had lung problems and required ventilation immediately after birth.
“The mother had tested positive for Covid-19 and the child subsequently tested positive as well.
It is important to appreciate the complexities of the underlying conditions [of] being born prematurely,” he said.
South Africa, which has the highest number of infections in Africa, reported 27 new deaths on Wednesday bringing total fatalities to 339.

他说：“即使某些事情不会导致迫在眉睫的身体伤害，我们也不希望误导信息成为病毒式传播的内容。”
Facebook最近从前广播公司和阴谋理论家戴维·伊克（David Icke）删除了内容，理由是这些内容“屡次违反了我们关于有害错误信息的政策”。
自Covid爆发以来，他们已经发布了7,500条错误信息通知，导致我们在帖子上发布了5,000万条警告标签。
公司控制扎克伯格先生还捍卫了他对世界上最强大的媒体平台的个人控制水平。
实际上，经过多年的争议和op亵之后，很明显，Facebook和扎克伯格对自己的公共角色感到更加自信。

"Even if something isn't going to lead to imminent physical harm, we don't want misinformation to be the content that is going viral," he said.
Facebook recently removed content from former broadcaster and conspiracy theorist David Icke for "repeatedly violating our policies on harmful misinformation".
Since the Covid outbreak, they have issued 7,500 notices of misinformation which has led to us issuing 50 million warning labels on posts.
Company controlMr Zuckerberg also defended his level of personal control over arguably the world's most powerful media platforms.
In fact, after many years of courting controversy and opprobrium, it seems clear that Facebook and Mr Zuckerberg are feeling more confident about their public roles.

随着世界各地开始放松封锁，一些人正在回头，发现孤立的时间似乎已经过了惊人的速度。
似乎难以相信，在封锁开始两个月之后，我们已经接近5月底。
在我看来，这种仪式似乎越来越频繁地出现，这在某种程度上是不错的，因为这是一个向邻居打招呼的机会，但还是令人不安，因为几周的时间仿佛在闪烁。

As parts of the world begin to ease their lockdowns, some people are looking back and finding the time in isolation seems to have gone surprisingly fast.
It seems hard to believe that we are already nearing the end of May, some two months after lockdowns began.
To me it feels as though the ritual is coming around more frequently, which is nice in one way because it is an opportunity to say hello to the neighbours, but disconcerting nonetheless because the weeks feels as though they are flashing by.

到现在为止，替代性历史通常是关于惨淡，威权主义未来的警示性故事，而第二次世界大战是一个热点。
在HBO的《反对美国的阴谋》中，查尔斯·林德伯格（Charles Lindbergh）是美国法西斯主义总统。
在亚马逊的《猎人》系列中，阿尔·帕西诺（Al Pacino）扮演的角色是犹太裔美国人，他们在1970年代追捕死灰复燃的纳粹分子。
但是2016年引发了不同的变化，也许是因为一个非英国脱欧的世界和希拉里·克林顿（Hillary Clinton）总统如此差点错过，结果令人震惊。
当希拉里和比尔在耶鲁法学院以理想主义学生的身份相遇时，我们在虚构的希拉里称之为“肮脏的”浪漫中感受到了他们在性和智力上的真正的相互吸引。

Until now, alternate histories have most often been cautionary tales about a bleak, authoritarian future, with World War Two a flashpoint.
In HBO’s The Plot Against America, Charles Lindbergh is the fascist president of the US.
In the Amazon series Hunters, Al Pacino’s character leads Jewish Americans as they track down resurgent Nazis in the 1970s.
But 2016 sparked a different dynamic, perhaps because a non-Brexit world and a President Hillary Clinton were such near-misses, the results so shocking.
When Hillary and Bill meet as idealistic students at Yale Law School, we feel their genuine mutual attraction, sexually and intellectually, in what the fictional Hillary calls a “swoony” romance.

阿斯利康表示，今年和明年，它能够生产十亿剂AZD1222疫苗。
正在进行初步试验，阿斯利康（AstraZeneca）表示已意识到该疫苗可能无效。
科学家警告称，如果开发出冠状病毒疫苗，可能无法赋予其完全的免疫力，而总理鲍里斯·约翰逊（Boris Johnson）警告说，永远不会找到这种疫苗。
它感谢英国和美国政府“为加速疫苗开发和生产提供了大力支持”。

Scientists have warned that a coronavirus vaccine, if developed, might not confer full immunity, while Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned that a vaccine might never be found.
It thanked the UK and US governments for "substantial support to accelerate the development and production of the vaccine".

中国在线零售巨头阿里巴巴于2014年在纽约证券交易所首次亮相。美国参议院通过了一项法案，该法案可能阻止一些中国公司在美国证券交易所出售股票。
它将要求海外公司遵循美国的审计和其他财务法规标准。
恰逢美中之间因病毒大流行而紧张关系加剧，以及在Luckin Coffee会计丑闻之后。
此后，这家中国咖啡连锁店解雇了其首席执行官和首席运营官，而另外六名据称曾参与或知道这笔交易的员工已被停职或休假。
自4月7日以来，这家遭受丑闻打击的公司的股票在周三恢复交易后暴跌了35％以上。

It comes as US-China tensions increase over the virus pandemic and after the Luckin Coffee accounting scandal.
The Chinese coffee chain has since sacked its chief executive and chief operating officer, while six other employees who were alleged to have been involved in or known about the transactions have been suspended or put on leave.
The scandal-hit firm's shares, which had been suspended since 7 April, plunged by more than 35% after they resumed trading on Wednesday.

教育部门的麻烦在于，它极易遭受冠状病毒大流行。
他们还倾向于向外国学生收取更多费用，这使他们成为许多大学的巨大收入来源。
据估计，外国学生每年对美国经济的价值高​​达450亿美元（370亿英镑）。
总理斯科特•莫里森（Scott Morrison）甚至说，如果外国学生在封锁期间无法自给自足，则应考虑返回本国。
美国的许多海外学生都要求为退课提供回扣，而美国的大学由于在校生的存在而发了财。

The trouble for the education sector is that it is uniquely vulnerable to the coronavirus pandemic.
They also tend to charge foreign students a lot more, making them a huge source of income for many universities.
The influx of foreign students is estimated to be worth as much as $45bn (£37bn) a year to the American economy.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison even went as far as saying that foreign students should consider going back to their home countries if they could not support themselves during the lockdown.
Many overseas students in the US are demanding rebates for lost lessons, and American universities make a small fortune from having students on site.

"Today, a large percentage of our team is working remotely, even as most offices remain open," a Mastercard spokesman said.
Mastercard employees who work in its offices must now follow social distancing rules, wear face masks and undergo temperature checks.

烹饪历史学家帕特里克·拉姆伯格（Patrick Rambourg）认为，riz au lait长期以来一直在法国餐桌上亮相-即使不是专门作为舒适食品的甜点，甚至根本没有甜点。 。
但最重要的是，一般来说riz au lait是一种送达贵族的菜。
Rambourg说，那么riz au lait可以说是一种儿童甜点，这种想法“最近才出现”。
“这太疯狂了：我在街上甚至在国外都停下来，因为riz au lait。
禁闭期间，杰戈为饥饿的巴黎人准备了200升的riz au lait，可以带回家中享用。

“I’d say everyone probably has a childhood memory associated with riz au lait.”According to culinary historian Patrick Rambourg, riz au lait has long featured on French tables – if not specifically as a comfort food dessert, or even a dessert at all.
But above all, riz au lait was generally a dish served to the aristocracy.
The idea of riz au lait being a childhood dessert, then, is one that appeared “very recently,” Rambourg said.
“It’s crazy: I get stopped in the street, even abroad, for riz au lait.
During confinement, Jégo has prepared 200 litres of riz au lait for hungry Parisians to take away and enjoy at home.

甚至某些传统的石材雕刻师都在重新考虑其材料的功能。
史密斯（Smith）是位于切尔西物理花园（Chelsea Physic Garden）的大英博物馆创始人汉斯·斯隆爵士（Hans Sloane）爵士在波特兰石头上新雕像的雕刻师。
伦敦的新西兰人Phil Cuttance在Jesmonite工作-碎石与丙烯酸树脂混合而成。
他说：“如果不存在Jesmonite，我将不会一成不变，因为如果你做错了举动，那就毁了。
石头是美丽，古老和珍贵的。”相反，他制作了“为更多人准备的更小的东西”，例如他的一系列人字形花瓶和打褶的镜框。

Even some traditional stone carvers are rethinking their material’s capabilities.
Smith is the carver behind the new statue in Portland stone of Sir Hans Sloane, the founder of the British Museum, which stands in Chelsea Physic Garden.
London-based New Zealander Phil Cuttance works in Jesmonite – ground-up stone mixed with an acrylic resin.
“If Jesmonite didn’t exist, I wouldn’t work in stone,” he says, because “if you make a wrong move it’s ruined.
Stone is beautiful, ancient, and precious.” Instead, he makes “smaller things for more people”, such as his series of herringbone-patterned vases and pleated mirror frames.
