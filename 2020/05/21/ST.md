东京（彭博社）-日本希望最早在星期四（5月21日）解除对大阪地区的紧急状态，但要保持东京的秩序，因为东京的案件尚未降到政府的门槛以下。
经济部长西村康俊（Yoshitoshi Nishimura）负责政府对病毒的反应，周四在政府关于大流行的咨询小组会议召开之前告诉记者，在大阪市和两个毗邻的县府取消该措施是适当的，并且不建议针对日本和日本取消该措施。东京地区。
共同社援引未透露姓名的官员的话称，预计首相安倍晋三将在周四正式宣布该决定。
据日本广播公司NHK报道，该紧急声明将对东京及其周边地区以及北海道北部岛屿生效。
本周的数据显示，解除紧急状态将有助于重新开放受病毒打击的经济的更多部分，上个季度陷入衰退。

TOKYO (BLOOMBERG) - Japan is looking to lift its state of emergency for the Osaka region as early as Thursday (May 21), but keep the order in place for Tokyo, where cases have not yet fallen below a government threshold.
Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, responsible for the government's virus response, told reporters on Thursday ahead of a meeting of a government advisory panel on the pandemic that it's appropriate to lift the measure in Osaka and two adjoining prefectures and didn't suggest lifting it for the Tokyo region.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to formalise the decision Thursday after hearing from the panel, Kyodo News reported citing unnamed officials.
The emergency declaration would stay in effect for Tokyo and surrounding prefectures, as well as the northern island of Hokkaido, public broadcaster NHK reported.
Lifting the emergency would help re-open more parts of the virus-battered economy, which sank last quarter into a recession, data this week showed.

尽管大多数其他商家上周重新营业，但全国范围内提供酒精饮料的场所仍然关闭。
总理贾辛达·阿登（Jacinda Ardern）的政府面临着艰巨的任务，要重启2000亿美元（合2827.6亿新元）的经济，经济增长将显着放缓，成千上万的工作机会将流失。
政府上周宣布了500亿新西兰元（合434.4亿新元）的一揽子计划，其中包括数十亿新西兰元用于基础设施，医疗保健，住房和工资补贴计划。
由于仍然禁止国际旅行，Ardern女士鼓励企业考虑允许每周工作四天，以便新西兰人可以在全国范围内旅行以帮助遭受重创的旅游业。
“考虑一下这是否适合您的工作场所，因为它肯定会帮助全国各地的旅游业。”

Venues serving alcohol have remained closed across the country despite most other businesses re-opening last week.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's government faces a tough task rebooting the US$200 billion (S$282.76 billion) economy, with growth expected to slow significantly and hundreds of thousands of jobs lost.
The government announced a NZ$50 billion (S$43.44 billion) package last week, which included billions on infrastructure, healthcare, housing and wage subsidy schemes.
With international travel still banned, Ms Ardern has encouraged businesses to consider allowing a four-day work week so New Zealanders can travel around the country to help the battered tourism industry.
"Think about whether that is something that would work for your workplace, because it certainly would help tourism all around the country."

分析人士认为，鉴于经济的不确定性以及对另一波爆发的担忧，中国今年不会设定国内生产总值（GDP）的增长目标。
“因此，政府写下增长目标是不切实际的。
像去年那样设定失业率目标也很困难，但设定通货膨胀目标则容易。”
在冠状病毒爆发之前，经济学家曾预计北京将今年的目标定在6％左右。
但经济在今年前三个月收缩了6.8％，是有记录以来最差的。

Analysts believe China will not set a gross domestic product (GDP) growth target this year, given the uncertainties in the economy and worries of another wave of outbreak.
"It is, therefore, impractical for the government to write down a growth target.
It is also difficult to set an unemployment rate target like last year, but easier to set an inflation target."
Before the coronavirus outbreak, economists had expected Beijing to set a target of around 6 per cent for this year.
But the economy contracted 6.8 per cent in the first three months of the year, the worst on record.

一些经济学家说，新加坡经济的分阶段重新开放可能会降低再次爆发感染浪潮的风险，但可能会将衰退延续到第三季度，并可能推迟复苏。
在经历了为期八周的断路器期之后，部分经济将在6月2日重新启动，并分三个阶段取消措施。
在第一阶段，大约三分之一的新加坡劳动力将能够在其工作场所恢复工作，而其余的劳动力将继续在家工作。
经济学家说，由于许多限制仍然存在，因此经济影响可能会减弱。
“在断路器时期，我们进一步加强了社会疏离措施。

The phased reopening of Singapore's economy may reduce the risk of another wave of infection, but will likely extend the recession into the third quarter and possibly delay recovery, say some economists.
Following an eight-week circuit breaker period, part of the economy will be reactivated on June 2, with measures to be lifted in three phases.
In phase one, about one-third of Singapore's workforce will be able to resume work at their workplaces, while the rest will continue to work from home.
The economic impact, however, may be muted as many restrictions will still be in place, economists say.
"Over the circuit breaker period, we have further enhanced our social distancing measures.

东京（法新社）-奥运会负责人托马斯·巴赫说，2021年是推迟在周四（5月21日）举行东京奥运会的“最后选择”，他强调推迟不会永远持续下去。
巴赫告诉英国广播公司，他同意日本的立场，即如果明年不能控制冠状病毒大流行，将必须取消奥运会。
3月，由于冠状病毒在全球蔓延，导致2020年东京奥林匹克运动会推迟至2021年7月23日，造成数十万人丧生，国际运动无法进行。
国际奥委会主席说：“坦率地说，我对（日本的立场）有所了解，因为你不能永远在组委会中雇用3000或5,000人。”
“你不能让运动员有不确定性，你不能与未来的奥运会有太多重叠。”

TOKYO (AFP) - Olympics chief Thomas Bach said 2021 was the "last option" for holding the delayed Tokyo Games on Thursday (May 21), stressing that postponement cannot go on forever.
Bach told the BBC that he agreed with Japan's stance that the Games will have to be cancelled if the coronavirus pandemic is not under control by next year.
In March, the Tokyo 2020 Olympics were postponed to July 23, 2021 as the coronavirus spread across the globe, killing hundreds of thousands of people and making international sport impossible.
"Quite frankly, I have some understanding for (Japan's position) because you cannot forever employ 3,000, or 5,000, people in an organising committee," the International Olympic Committee president said.
"You cannot have the athletes being in uncertainty, you cannot have so much overlapping with a future Olympic Games."
