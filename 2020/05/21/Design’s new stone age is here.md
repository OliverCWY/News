Even some traditional stone carvers are rethinking their material’s capabilities. Smith is the carver behind the new statue in Portland stone of Sir Hans Sloane, the founder of the British Museum, which stands in Chelsea Physic Garden. He’s now turned his efforts to domestic, decorative creations that could go above the mantelpiece in place of an oil painting.

Not every designer using stone is a purist. London-based New Zealander Phil Cuttance works in Jesmonite – ground-up stone mixed with an acrylic resin. “If Jesmonite didn’t exist, I wouldn’t work in stone,” he says, because “if you make a wrong move it’s ruined. Stone is beautiful, ancient, and precious.” Instead, he makes “smaller things for more people”, such as his series of herringbone-patterned vases and pleated mirror frames.

Once out of the mould, Cuttance etches it. “When people look at my objects, they assume they’re made by a computer router or 3D printer because of the complex geometry and sharp lines. When they get up close, they see they’re hand-crafted, and have come out of very low-fi process.” He’s now following up these pieces with a range of lighting.
