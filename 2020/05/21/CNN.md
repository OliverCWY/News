在北京和华盛顿之间日益激烈的口水战中，中国外交部对美国国务卿迈克·蓬佩奥进行了抨击。
外交部发言人赵立建周四表示：“ [庞培]发挥了完美作用，他是一位极不负责任的政治家，但他的无数谎言使他在世界上的信誉受到损害。”
]。“近几周来，有关大流行和贸易的紧张局势再次点燃了中美之间的紧张关系。
特朗普政府周三宣布，已批准向台湾再次出售武器。
赵在回应中说：“中国坚决反对美国向台湾出售武器，并向美国郑重表示。

China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lashed out at US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo amid a growing war of words between Beijing and Washington.
“[Pompeo] has played to perfection the part of an extremely irresponsible politician, but his numerous lies have bankrupted his credibility in the world,” Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Thursday.
].”Tensions over the pandemic and trade have reignited tensions between the US and China in recent weeks.
The Trump administration announced Wednesday that it had approved another potential arms sale to Taiwan.
Zhao said in response: “China is firmly opposed to the US arms sales to Taiwan and has made solemn representations to the US.

（CNN）三个月来韩国高中生第一次回到教室。
高中生星期三重返学校时，他们检查了体温，在校园里戴了口罩，坐在了隔开的桌子上，这与平常的社会疏散习惯相符。
据报道，韩国已经爆发了超过11100例冠状病毒病例，其中264人死亡。
2020年5月20日星期三，高中生到达韩国蔚山的Hamwol高中时保持社交疏远感。
在韩国，学生并非一次都回头。

(CNN) For the first time in three months, South Korean high school students are back in the classroom.
As high school seniors returned to school Wednesday, they had their temperatures checked, wore masks on campus, and sat at desks that were spaced apart, in line with commonplace social distancing practices.
South Korea -- which has reported more than 11,100 coronavirus cases and 264 deaths -- appears to have its outbreak largely under control.
Senior students maintain social distancing as they arrive at Hamwol High School in Ulsan, South Korea, Wednesday, May 20, 2020.
In South Korea, students aren't all heading back at once.

（CNN）美国总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）不停地向自己的政府伸出援手。
消息人士告诉美国有线电视新闻网，特朗普还深切关注外表，并认为戴着口罩可能削弱他的信息，即开放经济是安全的。
从字面上看是在反抗，特朗普和他的随行人员进入了美国国会大厦，周二裸露了面。
没有人可以指责特朗普在华盛顿本土化。
特朗普本周将访问密歇根州的一家福特工厂，管理层已公开告诉白宫，必须戴口罩。

(CNN) US President Donald Trump can't stop giving the finger to his own government.
Trump also cares deeply about appearances, and believes that wearing a mask could undercut his message that it's safe to open the economy, sources tell CNN.
Literally breathing defiance, Trump and his entourage swept into the US Capitol for lunch bare-faced on Tuesday.
No one can accuse Trump of going native in Washington.
Trump is due to visit a Ford factory in Michigan this week , where management has publicly told the White House that masks are mandatory.

尽管NIH在帮助开发疫苗方面发挥了作用，但Fauci并未出现参加面试以讨论有希望的结果。
NIH，NIAID和白宫的发言人已经协调了对冠状病毒工作队的采访，但当周三被问及为什么Fauci突然停止接受采访时，他没有发表评论。
福西（Fauci）的缺席之际，是新成立的白宫传播团队改变了大流行的公共关系策略。
最近几周，由于病毒造成的经济破坏，白宫将其信息重新聚焦于重新开放该国。
在总统和白宫推动经济重新开放的同时，一些专家警告说，这可能为时过早。

Despite the NIH's role in helping to develop the vaccine, Fauci did not appear for interviews to discuss the promising results.
Spokespeople for NIH, NIAID and the White House, which had coordinated interviews for the coronavirus task force, did not offer comment when asked Wednesday why Fauci suddenly stopped granting interviews.
Fauci's absence comes as the newly implemented White House communications team has changed its public relations strategy for the pandemic.
And in recent weeks, the White House has refocused its message on reopening the country amid the economic havoc wreaked by the virus.
While the President and White House have pushed for the reopening of the economy, some experts have cautioned it could be too soon.

在少数情况下，死者的家属由于封锁而无法领取尸体。
如果疫情一过，他们的家人挺身索要尸体，遗体将被挖掘并重新埋葬。
当波菲里奥（Porfirio）抗议时，她说一位工作人员告诉她，房屋别无选择。空间用完了。
伦巴第地区政府告诉美国有线电视新闻网，由于正在进行的调查，它没有就“疗养院问题”进行采访。
然而，与意大利其他地方相比，冠状病毒的死亡人数要轻一些，在伦巴第大区上空悬挂着一丝悲伤。

In a few cases, the families of the dead have been unable to claim the bodies because of the lockdown.
If their families come forward to claim the bodies once the epidemic is over, the remains will be exhumed and reburied.
When Porfirio protested, she says a staff member told her the home had no choice; it had run out of space.
The Lombardy regional government told CNN it is not giving interviews on "the nursing home issue," due to the ongoing investigation.
Yet unlike other parts of Italy where coronavirus' toll was lighter, in Lombardy a hint of sorrow hangs in the air.

旧金山（CNN）尽管在冠状病毒大流行期间数千人仍在旧金山处于庇护状态，但一项有争议的提议允许无家可归者在城市公园内搭帐篷，此举引发了立法者和该市以自由政治着称的居民之间的辩论。
面对一些居民的法律诉讼，旧金山最近在市政厅的阴影下开设了第一个“安全睡眠区”，提供了一个有监督且与身体保持一定距离的区域，不受庇护的居民可以合法地在帐篷中扎营。
第二个指定地点也已选定，预计将很快开放。
“这已经非常非常困难。
多年来，这一直是我们的现实，这只会使一切更具挑战性。”倡导组织无家可归者联盟的凯利卡特勒说。

San Francisco (CNN) While thousands of people remain unsheltered in San Francisco amid the coronavirus pandemic, a controversial proposal to allow the homeless to pitch tents in the city's parks has sparked debate among lawmakers and residents in a city famous for its liberal politics.
Facing legal action from some residents, San Francisco recently opened its first "Safe Sleeping Site" in the shadow of City Hall, providing a supervised and physically distanced area where unsheltered residents can legally camp in tents.
A second designated site has also been selected and is expected to open soon.
"It's already been really, really hard.
This has been our reality for many years and this is just making everything more challenging," said Kelly Cutler of the Coalition on Homelessness, an advocacy group.

Glendale警察Tiffany Ngalula周三晚说，其中一名受害者处于危急状态，而另外两名则没有生命危险。
恩加卢拉说，枪击事件是在警察到达时结束的。他补充说，警察“对嫌疑犯提出了挑战，并能够将其拘留。”
犯罪嫌疑人的身份尚未被释放。
韦斯特盖特娱乐区（Westgate Entertainment District）在给CNN的一份声明中说，他们“对此事件深感困扰，我们向受害者及其家人致以深深的哀思。”

(CNN) A suspect is in custody after three people were shot Wednesday night at the Westgate Entertainment District in Glendale, Arizona, police say.
One victim is listed in critical condition while the two others had non-life threatening injuries, Glendale Police Officer Tiffany Ngalula said Wednesday night.
The shooting was over by the time officers arrived, Ngalula said, adding police "challenged the suspect and were able to take that person into custody."
The suspect's identity has not been released.
In a statement to CNN, Westgate Entertainment District said they were "deeply troubled by this incident and our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families."

专家们说，在冠状病毒时代，皮肤癌的危险肯定没有消失，而且使用防晒霜比以往任何时候都更加重要。
尽管生存率越来越好，但黑色素瘤仍是美国第五大最常被诊断出的癌症。
2008年瑞士的一项研究在85％的母乳样品中发现了氧苯甲酮或其他四种防晒剂之一，这引发了人们对新生儿可能暴露的担忧。
FDA的新准则遭到封锁数十年来，FDA一直在制定更严格的防晒霜测试和安全性准则。
实际上，防晒霜的SPF（防晒系数）仅适用于引起晒伤的UVB射线，不适用于也会损坏和老化皮肤的UVA射线。

The danger of skin cancer certainly hasn't disappeared during the age of coronavirus, and using sunscreen is more important than ever, experts say.
And while survival rates are getting better, melanoma is still the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States.
2008 Swiss study found oxybenzone or one of four other sunscreen chemicals in 85% of breast milk samples, sparking concern that newborns could be exposed.
FDA's new guidelines blockedThe FDA has been working on more stringent guidelines on sunscreen testing and safety for decades.
In fact the SPF (sun protection factor) of sunscreens applies only to the UVB rays that cause sunburn and not the UVA rays that also damage and age the skin.

香港（CNN）25年前，一个6岁的男孩被公认为班禅喇嘛的转世，班禅是藏传佛教中第二高的人物。
西藏精神领袖达赖喇嘛（Gaihun Choekyi Nyima）在其前任去世六年后，于1995年被达赖喇嘛确定为十一世班禅喇嘛。
但是北京拒绝了他，并迅速提出了自己的候选人格安坚·诺布（Gyancain Norbu），中国政府称其为“真正的”班禅喇嘛。
2017年4月25日，在印度达兰萨拉附近的麦克劳根甘杰，两名妇女在肖像画上放了一条礼仪围巾，上面写着Gedhun Choekyi Nyima的最后一次认识的图像。
自成年以来，Gyancain Norbu扮演着越来越重要的角色，加入了中国最高政治机构，并经常出现在北京的重要活动中。

Hong Kong (CNN) Twenty-five years ago, a six-year-old boy was recognized as the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, the second-highest ranking figure in Tibetan Buddhism.
Gedhun Choekyi Nyima was identified by the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, as the 11th Panchen Lama in 1995, six years after the death of his predecessor.
But Beijing rejected him and quickly put forward its own candidate, Gyancain Norbu, who the Chinese government claims is the "real" Panchen Lama.
Two women place a ceremonial scarf above a portrait showing the last know image of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, in Mcleodganj near Dharamsala, India, on April 25, 2017.
Since becoming an adult, Gyancain Norbu has occupied an increasingly high profile role, joining a top Chinese political body and often appearing at important events in Beijing.

Officials had been warning nearby residents to evacuate all day Tuesday because of fears the hydroelectric dam holding back Wixom Lake would break.
An aerial image taken by a drone shows the Edenville dam breach on Wednesday.
The entire lake covered roughly 2,600 acres, according to a Michigan Department of Natural Resources report in 2009.
Water can be seen gushing out of the dam's spillway -- officials were trying to release water from the lake to maintain the dam's integrity.

Little by little, he's been making the most out of the situation by repairing and painting the walls of the house.
"Luckily the hardware store in town has always been open and I'm so glad we bought two properties and not just the one euro house as it has no water nor electricity."
The ordeal, instead of having killed enthusiasm for his one euro house adventure, has fueled a desire to purchase a third abandoned building.
"I love this town and the people, even if they don't know you, they help you out.
Roque says he picked Vergemoli of all places in Italy to buy a one euro house because, despite all that's happened, it remains a dream destination.

一杯茶使一切变得更好几个世纪以来，茶的用途远不止口渴。
随着全球茶叶消费量的增加，联合国将5月21日定为有史以来的第一个“国际茶叶日”。
在2014年的一项研究中，他向12位健康的志愿者提供了相当于一两杯绿茶的绿茶提取物，并对他们的大脑成像以分析某些大脑区域内的连通性变化。
该评论得出结论，“希望更多的西方人每天摄入至少100毫升（3.3液盎司）绿茶”以保护神经认知功能。

The kids make cupcakes or other baked treats, and tea is served from a traditional English tea set Seabright inherited from her grandmother.
A cup of tea makes everything betterFor centuries, tea has been used for far more than quenching thirst.
With tea consumption growing around the world, the United Nations has designated May 21 the first ever "International Tea Day."
In a 2014 study, he gave green tea extracts equivalent to one or two cups of green tea to 12 healthy volunteers and imaged their brains to analyze changes in connectivity inside certain brain regions.
That review concluded that "it would be desirable" for more Westerners to consume at least 100 milliliters (3.3 fluid ounces) of green tea each day "to protect neurocognitive function."

（CNN）Esteban Granero经常能够看到与球场上其他球员不同的事物。
“我认为我们的模型是我们可以找到的关于大流行的最好模型，”格拉内罗在马贝拉家中的禁闭处告诉CNN。
Granero说：“德国做得很好，因为它们对数据非常真实。”
因此，最重要的事情是从现在开始尝试做正确的事情，而最好的方法就是尝试听取专家的意见，当然，也要以最好的方式使用技术。”
在西班牙冠状病毒使足球停顿之前，马贝拉位居第二，并在寻找晋升机会时确保进入季后赛。

(CNN) Esteban Granero has often been able to see things differently to other players on the pitch.
"I think our models are the best we can find about the pandemic," Granero tells CNN from lockdown at his home in Marbella.
"Germany did a good job because they are very realistic with data," Granero says.
So the most important thing is try to do the right things from now, and the best way is trying to hear the specialists and, of course, use technology in the best way."
Before the coronavirus brought football to a halt in Spain, Marbella was in second place and looking assured of a playoff spot as it went in search of promotion.

（CNN）如果穆罕默德·萨拉赫（Mohamed Salah）所树立的榜样不胜枚举，那么如果有任何足球运动员正在寻找有创造力的进球庆祝活动，那么他们的孩子可能就是最好的灵感来源。
自从利物浦在欧冠对托特纳姆热刺的最终胜利中打开进球记录以来，已经快一年了。
在庆祝活动中遭到其他队友围攻之后，萨拉（Salah）俯视了万达大都会体育场（Wanda Metropolitano Stadium）众多摄像机之一的镜筒，以庆祝自己的特殊庆典。
萨拉赫（Salah）在2019年欧洲冠军联赛决赛中攻入首个进球后庆祝。
他将手指在脸部前扭过，然后将一只舌头伸到鼻子的每一侧，同时伸出舌头。

(CNN) If any footballers are looking for inventive goal celebrations, their children might just be the best source of inspiration if the example set by Mohamed Salah is anything to go by.
It is almost a year to the day since he was opening the scoring for Liverpool in its Champions League final victory over Tottenham Hotspur.
After being mobbed by the rest of his teammates in celebration, Salah looked down the barrel of one of the many cameras in the Wanda Metropolitano Stadium for his own, special celebration.
Salah celebrates after scoring the opening goal during the UEFA Champions League final in 2019.
He twisted his fingers in front of his face before placing one on each side of his nose while sticking his tongue out.

CNNB由徐家琳（Karina Tsui）撰写，在冠状病毒封锁期间，海边度假似乎像是一段遥远的回忆，但是在首尔的江南区，大海已经来到了这座城市。
韩国最大的数字广告牌SMTown COEX大楼的LED立面上已经出现了巨大的浪潮。
该项目名为“ WAVE”，是由d'strict设计的，d'strict是一家专门从事沉浸式技术创作公共艺术的公司。
该项目从头到尾花费了四个月的时间，其中包括三个月的数字设计工作，以确保达到预期的效果。
屏幕尺寸为80 x 20米（262 x 66英尺），是品牌广告，韩流视频以及最近的数字艺术装置的流行平台。

Written by Karina Tsui, CNNBeachside vacations may seem like a distant memory during coronavirus lockdowns, but in Seoul's Gangnam District, the ocean has come to the city.
A giant wave has appeared on the LED façade of the city's SMTown COEX building, South Korea's biggest digital billboard.
Titled "WAVE," the project was designed by d'strict -- a firm that specializes in using immersive technology to create public art.
The project took four months to execute from start to finish, including three months of digital design work to make sure it achieved the desired effect.
The screen, measuring 80 by 20 meters (262 by 66 feet), is a popular platform for brand advertisements, K-pop videos, and more recently, digital art installations.

告诫受害人愚蠢到在道路安全记录不佳的国家骑摩托车。
我很高兴在20年前就没有社交媒体了，那时我还是那个不幸的天真背包客，躺在苏梅岛的医院病床上，缝着针刺覆盖了我身体的大部分部位-包括我的舌头-并排泄了塑料管在我的膝盖上。
正如去过苏梅岛的任何人所知道的那样，这些道路是弯曲的，蜿蜒穿过岛上丛林覆盖的丘陵。
返回加拿大，比原定计划提前11个月到达苏梅岛机场，当我们被卷入出发区时，我永远不会忘记其他航空旅行者的面孔。
将近二十年后，我们回到苏梅岛参加朋友的婚礼。

Admonishing the victim for being foolish enough to ride a motorbike in a country with such dismal road safety records.
I'm glad social media wasn't a thing 20 years ago, when I was that unfortunate, naive backpacker, lying in a Koh Samui hospital bed with stitches covering significant portions of my body -- including my tongue -- and a plastic drainage tube in my knee.
As anyone who's been to Koh Samui knows, those roads are curvy, winding through the island's jungle-covered hills.
Back to Canada, 11 months ahead of scheduleArriving at Koh Samui Airport, I'll never forget the looks on the faces of fellow air travelers as we were rolled into the departure zone.
Nearly two decades later, we returned to Koh Samui for a friend's wedding.

（CNN）联邦当局希望在拍卖中以160万美元的价格将一件稀有的古代文物返回伊拉克后，再将其出售给美国一家手工艺品商店。
Hobby Lobby现在正在起诉拍卖行欺诈和违反合同。
司法部的新闻稿说，这种被称为吉尔伽美什梦碑的人工制品“起源于现代伊拉克地区，违反联邦法律进入美国”。
根据司法部发布的消息，该平板电脑于2019年9月被执法人员从圣经博物馆没收。
周一，提起了民事诉讼，要求将该文物没收给美国当局。

(CNN) Federal authorities want a rare, ancient artifact returned to Iraq after it was sold to a US craft store for $1.6 million in an auction.
Hobby Lobby is now suing the auction house for fraud and breach of contract.
The artifact, known as the Gilgamesh Dream Tablet, "originated in the area of modern-day Iraq and entered the United States contrary to federal law," according a news release from the Department of Justice.
The tablet was seized from the Museum of the Bible by law enforcement agents in September 2019, according to a release from the Department of Justice.
On Monday, the civil complaint was filed seeking to forfeit the artifact to US authorities.

## 历史上最致命的空袭发生在二战期间的东京，您可能从未听说过

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
这次空袭后来估计是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

但是，美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）采访了包括帕特里夏（Patricia）在内的五名十几岁左右的女性，他们声称格拉泽（Glaser）在Bery's Place对其进行了性和情感虐待。
当女孩们反对时，他们说格拉泽会威胁要把他们赶出去。
一些幸存者说，格拉瑟（Glaser）介绍自己是一名医生，但是支持检方的律师告诉CNN，他是物理治疗师-不是合格的医生。
Dilen去年2月在Bery's Place进行的一次警察突袭中被警察盘问而被捕，随后被释放。
但至少现在，他们说，他们开始在贝里故居之外享受生活。

But five women in their late teens and early twenties interviewed by CNN, including Patricia, allege that Glaser sexually and emotionally abused them at Bery's Place.
When the girls objected, they say Glaser would threaten to cast them out on the streets.
Some survivors say Glaser introduced himself as a doctor, but lawyers supporting the prosecution told CNN that he is a physiotherapist -- not a qualified physician.
Dilen was arrested for questioning by police last February during a police raid at Bery's Place, and later released.
But for now, at least, they say they're beginning to enjoy their lives outside of Bery's Place.
