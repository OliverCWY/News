Every morning Li-Huei Tsai meditates in front of a flashing screen. In sync with the flickering light, there is a harsh clicking – a little like the tapping of an over-enthusiastic flamenco dancer with her castanets. But the rhythm isn’t there to entertain, but to entrain.

The combination of the flashing light and clicking lights are designed to synchronise a particular type of electrical activity in the brain known as gamma waves.

To the uninitiated, this kind of light-and-sound bath may sound like the latest wellness fad – but Tsai is a neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, USA. And she has evidence that this could provide protection against Alzheimer’s disease.

Her research represents a radical new approach to preventing and treating the most common form of dementia. Today, dementia affects around 50 million people worldwide – and by 2050, that figure is expected to triple.
