美国总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）为自己的政治生活而战，但在11月的胜利或失败之际，他的政治继承人却在激昂。
庞培知道共和党候选人将需要他们时，明确表示他是特朗普最受信任的中尉之一。

US President Donald Trump is fighting for his political life, but win or lose in November, his political heirs are stirring .

（CNN）根据美国空军在欧洲和非洲空军公共事务部的声明，两架俄罗斯飞机周五在黑海和国际水域对美国空军B-52轰炸机进行了“不安全，不专业”的拦截。
声明说，俄罗斯飞行员多次越过B-52机鼻100英尺以内，并且对B-52造成湍流，限制了其机动能力。
美国驻欧洲空军和非洲空军司令杰夫·哈里吉安将军说：“此类行动增加了发生空中相撞的可能性，是不必要的，而且与良好的飞行技术和国际飞行规则不符。”
他说：“俄罗斯飞机在国际领空飞行时，危害了所涉飞机的飞行安全。
我们希望它们能在确保安全和防止事故的国际标准范围内运行。”

(CNN) Two Russian aircraft made an "unsafe, unprofessional" intercept of a US Air Force B-52 bomber on Friday over the Black Sea and in international waters, according to a statement from US Air Forces in Europe and Air Forces Africa Public Affairs.
The Russia pilots crossed within 100 feet of the nose of the B-52 multiple times and also caused turbulence to the B-52 restricting its ability to maneuver, according to the statement.
"Actions like these increase the potential for midair collisions, are unnecessary, and inconsistent with good airmanship and international flight rules," said Gen. Jeff Harrigian, US Air Forces in Europe and Air Forces Africa commander, in the statement.
"While the Russian aircraft were operating in international airspace, they jeopardized the safety of flight of the aircraft involved.
We expect them to operate within international standards set to ensure safety and prevent accidents," he said.

（CNN）法国右翼杂志对最近一期中刊登的一幅插图表示愤慨，该插图描绘了黑人政客DanièleObono是18世纪的奴隶。
Valeurs Actuelles最初在Twitter上回应了Obono的言论，说：“种族主义的狗屎？
Valeurs Actuelles并不是唯一一家以发表有争议的法国政治人物插图而闻名的法国杂志。
Minute是一本较小的右翼杂志，于2013年出版了前法国司法大臣Christine Taubira的讽刺漫画，引起轩然大波。
副编辑Tugdual Denis在接受BFMTV采访时表示，Valeurs Actuelles从未“想震惊”或“挑衅”。

(CNN) A French right-wing magazine has sparked outrage over an illustration published in its most recent issue depicting the Black politician Danièle Obono as an 18th century slave.
Valeurs Actuelles initially responded to Obono's remarks on Twitter, saying: "Racist shit?
Valeurs Actuelles is not the only French magazine known for publishing controversial illustrations of French politicians.
Minute, a smaller right-wing magazine, published a caricature of former French Minister for Justice Christine Taubira in 2013, sparking uproar.
During his interview with BFMTV, deputy editor Tugdual Denis said Valeurs Actuelles never "wants to shock" or "provoke."

Sky Drive公司在新闻稿中说，Sky Drive公司于8月25日在丰田试验场进行了公开演示。丰田试验场是日本最大的试验场之一，也是该汽车公司开发基地的所在地。
这是日本历史上首次公开展示飞行汽车。
这辆名为SD-03的汽车载有一名飞行员，起飞并绕着场地转了大约四分钟。
该公司首席执行官福泽友宏（Tomohiro Fukuzawa）在一份声明中说：“自我们创立SkyDrive以来，两年内实现了日本有史以来首次载人飞行飞行，我们感到非常兴奋。

(CNN) A Japanese company has announced the successful test drive of a flying car.
Sky Drive Inc. conducted the public demonstration on August 25, the company said in a news release , at the Toyota Test Field, one of the largest in Japan and home to the car company's development base.

（CNN）俱乐部消息人士向美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）证实，莱昂内尔·梅西（Lionel Messi）未能于周日在巴塞罗那的训练场参加冠状病毒测试，这进一步怀疑了他在西甲大赛的前途。
根据西甲规则，如果没有通过测试，梅西将无法参加新教练罗纳德·科曼（Ronald Koeman）的季前训练，而2020-21赛季将在两周内开始。
俱乐部消息人士告诉CNN，巴塞罗那一线队其他成员都参加了测试，而梅西是唯一的缺席者。
巴塞罗那乌拉圭前锋路易斯·苏亚雷斯（Luis Suarez）抵达巴塞罗那的休达（Ciutat Esportiva）琼·安吉尔（Joan Gamper），接受Covid-19的医疗检查。
梅西无疑是，但是这位33岁的俱乐部传奇人物周二提交了一份转让请求，震惊了巴萨酋长，该请求是由Burofax发送给诺坎普办事处的。

(CNN) Lionel Messi failed to show up for a coronavirus test at Barcelona's training ground on Sunday, club sources have confirmed to CNN, casting further doubt on his future at the La Liga powerhouse.
Under La Liga rules, without passing a test, Messi will be unable to take part in pre-season training under new coach Ronald Koeman, with the 2020-21 season set to start in two weeks.
Club sources told CNN that the rest of the Barcelona first team squad had taken the test, with Messi the only absentee.
Barcelona's Uruguayan forward Luis Suarez arrives at Barcelona's Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper to undergo a medical test for Covid-19.
Messi most certainly is, but the 33-year-old club legend stunned Barca chiefs on Tuesday by submitting a transfer request, sent by Burofax to the offices at Camp Nou.

为了具有代表性，疫苗试验应以与少数民族人口相似的百分比招募少数族裔。
Fauci最近告诉CNN，他希望看到少数人参加冠状病毒疫苗试验的水平至少是其人口百分比的两倍，因为Covid-19对这些人群的打击尤其严重。
政府致力于研发冠状病毒疫苗的“扭曲速度行动”（Operation Warp Speed）表示，其目标是到1月交付3亿剂疫苗，这在疫苗临床试验历史上是闻所未闻的。
“出于少数原因，招募少数族裔参加疫苗试验很重要。
如果该公司继续以与上周相同的速度进行招聘，则可以在9月中旬之前完全注册该试用版。

To be representative, vaccine trials should enroll minorities in percentages similar to their representation in the population.
Fauci told CNN recently that he wanted to see minorities enrolled in coronavirus vaccine trials at levels at least double their percentages in the population, because Covid-19 has hit those groups especially hard.
Operation Warp Speed, the government's effort to develop a coronavirus vaccine, says it aims to deliver 300 million doses by January -- a speed unheard of in the history of vaccine clinical trials.
"Recruiting minorities into the vaccine trials is important for two reasons.
If the company continues to recruit at the same rate as last week, it could fully enroll the trial by mid-September.

“他是为这辆卡车专门写的，”科斯坦佐说。

"We're so excited to find you here in Brooklyn Bridge Park\!"
From the bed of a rented truck, Costanzo wailed the repeated refrain to a city still mourning its dead: "Remember me but forget my fate.
"He wrote this specifically for this truck," Costanzo said.

（CNN）科罗拉多州的一名女童军部队通过制造个人防护设备抵御冠状病毒来帮助了当地的一所小学，他们用曲奇销售的钱来做这件事。
艾玛·邦格特（Emma Bangerter）是高地牧场野猫山小学5年级的学生，也是部队65430的成员。她说，在大流行中重新开学相关的斗争激发了她的部队。
10岁的Bangerter对CNN表示：“我的女童子军部队出于不必要的目的提出了这个项目的想法，以减轻工作人员和学生重返校园的压力。”
“因此，用部队的曲奇钱，我们购买了制作打喷嚏护卫，可重复使用的口罩和口罩挂绳的材料。”
8月14日，星期五，女童军少年部队65430向野猫山小学的老师和工作人员分发了个人防护装备和“欢迎回来”卡片。

(CNN) A Girl Scout troop in Colorado has come to the aid of a local elementary school by making personal protective equipment to fend off the coronavirus -- and they used money made from cookie sales to do it.
Emma Bangerter, a 5th grader at Wildcat Mountain Elementary School in Highlands Ranch -- and a member of Troop 65430 -- says the struggles associated with reopening schools amid a pandemic inspired her troop.
"My Girl Scout troop and I came up with the idea for this project out of the need...to ease the tension of going back to school for staff and students," Bangerter, 10, told CNN.
"So using our troop's cookie money, we bought the material to make the sneeze guards, reusable masks and mask lanyards."
Girl Scout Juniors Troop 65430 delivered PPE and 'welcome back' cards to teachers and staff at Wildcat Mountain Elementary School on Friday, August 14.

“根据希腊的司法程序，提出上诉可以使法院的初裁无效，使定罪无效。
“根据希腊法律，我们的介入是在希腊司法系统接管时结束的。
根据希腊法院的判决，马奎尔立即被撤回，索斯盖特说：“这符合各方的最大利益。”

He also called on the Manchester United player, who is the world's most expensive defender, to apologize.
"An appeal against yesterday's verdict was lodged this morning by Harry's legal team," said the United statement.
"In accordance with the Greek judicial process, the filing of an appeal extinguishes the initial court verdict and nullifies the conviction.
"Our involvement was concluded when the Greek justice system took over, according to Greek law.
Following the verdict of the Greek court, Maguire was immediately withdrawn, with Southgate saying: "it was in the best interests of all parties."

伦敦（CNN商业）如果您正在工作中并且您的一位同事发表了种族主义言论，您会挑战还是让它通过？
这种情况是美国初创公司Vantage Point在其培训计划中提供的众多解决方案之一，以解决工作场所的种族歧视。
使用虚拟现实（VR）头戴式耳机，员工可以沉浸在基于真实事件的场景中，在该场景中观看歧视现场，并询问他们将如何应对。
该公司的创始人摩根·默瑟（Morgan Mercer）是一位混血儿，在工作场所遭受了种族主义和性别歧视。
她对CNN Business表示：“我意识到，这确实能有效地使您脱颖而出。”

London (CNN Business) If you were at work and one of your colleagues made a racist remark, would you challenge it or let it pass?
This scenario is one of the many that US startup Vantage Point provides in its training program to tackle racial discrimination in the workplace.
Using virtual reality (VR) headsets, employees are immersed in scenarios based on real events, where they watch a scene of discrimination unfold and are asked how they would respond.
Morgan Mercer, the company's founder, is a biracial woman who has been subjected to both racism and sexism in the workplace.
"I realized how effective it is in truly putting you in a person's shoes," she tells CNN Business.

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-通过吸引人的飞机制服吸引公众注意力时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常为白色，但并非总是如此（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板应用了最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，合并和收购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
