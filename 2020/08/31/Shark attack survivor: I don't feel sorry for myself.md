For Australian Paul de Gelder, a horrifying bite from a bull shark in 2009 cost him a hand and a leg, changing his life forever.

But he neither blames nor fears the creature which attacked him. Instead, he now advocates for the conservation, preservation and protection of sharks. He is one of the stars on the Discovery Channel programme Shark Week, whose 32nd edition airs from tomorrow to Sept 6.
