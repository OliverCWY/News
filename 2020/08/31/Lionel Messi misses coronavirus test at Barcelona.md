Club sources told CNN that the rest of the Barcelona first team squad had taken the test, with Messi the only absentee.

Luis Suarez -- Messi's friend and strike partner -- was among those seen arriving at the Ciutat Esportiva training ground, despite reports that the Uruguayan international is not part of Koeman's plans for the new season.
