这部电影的导演菲利普·考夫曼（Philip Kaufman）是一位折衷的美国电影制片人，其职业生涯始于独立电影《戈德斯坦》（Goldstein，1964年）。
他的电影关于开拓性的宇航员，《正确的东西》（The Right Stuff，1983）被提名八项奥斯卡金像奖。
在1996年的特柳赖德电影节上放映电影后，考夫曼描述了他的震惊，当时他说：“我们站在一个广场上，突然有30个人穿着流浪者夹克走了出来，包围了我们。
在电影节上工作的每个人都制作了自己的外套-他们都是流浪者-他们知道电影中的每一行。
我已经回来了几次-他们在山上保持了流浪者的传统。

The film’s director, Philip Kaufman, is an eclectic US filmmaker whose career began with independent film Goldstein (1964).
His film about pioneering astronauts, The Right Stuff (1983), was nominated for eight Academy Awards.
Following a re-release of the film at Telluride Film Festival in 1996, Kaufman described his shock when, “We were standing in a square and suddenly 30 people in Wanderers jackets came running out to surround us.
Everybody who was working at the festival had made their own jackets – and they were all Wanderers – they knew every line in the movie.
And I’ve been back a few times – and they keep the tradition of the Wanderers alive, up there in the mountains.

美国零售巨头沃尔玛表示将与微软合作竞购TikTok在美国的业务。
沃尔玛告诉英国广播公司，它认为与中国视频共享应用程序达成协议将有助于其扩大业务。
沃尔玛发言人向英国广播公司证实，确认该公司正在达成一项交易：“我们相信，沃尔玛与微软的合作伙伴关系将满足美国TikTok用户的期望，同时满足美国政府监管机构的担忧。”
微软在8月初证实它正在与TikTok进行谈判，它告诉英国广播公司“目前没有任何东西可分享”。
据报道，如果达成交易，TikTok的美国业务可能会获得高达300亿美元（220亿英镑）的价格。

Image copyright Getty ImagesThe US retail giant Walmart has said it will team up with Microsoft to make a bid for the US operations of TikTok.
Walmart told the BBC it thought a deal with the Chinese video-sharing app would help it expand its operations.
Confirming that the company was pursuing a deal, a Walmart spokesperson told the BBC: "We are confident that a Walmart and Microsoft partnership would meet both the expectations of US TikTok users while satisfying the concerns of US government regulators."
Microsoft, which confirmed at the beginning of August that it was in talks with TikTok, told the BBC it had "nothing to share at this time".
According to reports, TikTok's US operations could fetch as much as $30bn (£22bn) if a deal is reached.

中国科技公司的几位内部人士说，乔·拜登担任总统职位比特朗普总统再任四年更具吸引力-这将被视为“不可预测的”。
特朗普总统及其政府在有关中国的推文和新闻声明中谈到了这一点。
共和党海外游说团体副主席兼首席执行官所罗门·岳（Solomon Yue）表示，毫无疑问，在特朗普政府执政期间，“脱钩将加速进行”。
随着中美之间的紧张局势恶化，其他中国公司也将越来越多地效仿。
但这正是特朗普总统所说的需要改变的：他的政府认为中国已经变得更富裕，而美国却变得更穷。

Several insiders at Chinese technology firms say have told me that a Joe Biden presidency would be more appealing than another four more years of President Trump - which would be seen as "unpredictable".
President Trump and his administration talk about it in tweets and in press statements in relation to China.
Make no mistake, under a Trump administration "decoupling will be accelerated", according to Solomon Yue, vice chairman and chief executive of the Republicans Overseas lobby group.
Increasingly other Chinese companies are likely to follow suit, as tensions between the US and China get worse.
But that's precisely what President Trump says needs to change: his administration argues that China has become richer while the US has become poorer.

这些工作将主要在其商店进行，但90个职位也将在其支持中心失去。
现在，它在英国的367家商店的营业时间比大流行之前要少得多，该公司已要求员工减少营业时间。
该公司曾警告称，将在6月份裁员1000人，但在本周完成重组协议后，这一数字有所上升。
行业机构UK Hospitality表示，尽管锁定措施有所缓解，但仍有大约三分之一的饭店和酒吧仍未营业，因为人们仍对这种病毒的传播感到担忧。

The jobs will mainly go at its shops, but 90 roles will also be lost at its support centre.
It 367 UK stores are now open for significantly fewer hours than they were before the pandemic, and the firm has asked staff to reduce their hours.
The firm had warned it would cut 1,000 jobs back in June, but that number has risen after it finalised a restructuring deal this week.
Industry body UK Hospitality says around a third of restaurants and bars have still not reopened despite the easing of lockdown, as people remain nervous about the spread of the virus.
