MOSCOW (REUTERS) - Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny is in a serious condition in a Siberian hospital after suffering severe symptoms of what his spokesman on Thursday (Aug 20) said she believed was a deliberate poisoning.

Mr Navalny, 44, is unconscious, in intensive care and on an artificial lung ventilator, his spokesman Kira Yarmysh said on social media.

“We assume that Alexei was poisoned with something mixed into his tea. It was the only thing that he drank in the morning. Doctors say the toxin was absorbed faster through the hot liquid. Alexei is now unconscious,” Ms Yarmysh said.

She did not say who she believed may have poisoned Mr Navalny, but said police had been called to the hospital.

Mr Navalny, a fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin, had started feeling ill when returning to Moscow from Tomsk in Siberia by plane on Wednesday morning, Ms Yarmysh added.

Mr Pavel Lebedev, a fellow passenger, posted an account of what he saw on social media.

“At the start of the flight he went to the toilet and didn’t come back. He started feeling really sick. They struggled to bring him round and he was screaming in pain.”

Mr Navalny had drunk a cup of tea at a Tomsk airport cafe before boarding his flight, Ms Yarmysh said.

The Interfax news agency quoted the cafe’s owners as saying they were checking CCTV cameras to try to establish what had happened.

Mr Navalny’s plane later made an emergency landing in Omsk so that he could be rushed to hospital.

Footage posted on social media by a fellow passenger showed a motionless Mr Navalny being stretchered into an ambulance by medics.

S7, the airline he was travelling with, said Mr Navalny had started feeling very ill soon after take-off and that the captain had decided to make an emergency landing at a nearby airport.

It said he had not eaten or drunk anything on board.

One of the doctors at a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk who was treating him said it was not certain that he had been poisoned as his allies have suggested.

Dr Anatoly Kalinichenko said ‘natural poisoning’ was one of several diagnoses being considered but that tests were ongoing.

Ms Yarmysh drew a parallel with an incident last year in which Mr Navalny suffered an acute allergic reaction that one doctor said could have resulted from poisoning with an unknown chemical.

“Obviously the same has been done to him now,” said Ms Yarmysh.

Mr Navalny, a lawyer and anti-corruption activist, has served many stints in jail in recent years for organising anti-Kremlin protests and been physically attacked in the street by pro-government activists.

He has helped investigations into what he has said are outrageous examples of official corruption.

Russia holds regional elections next month and Mr Navalny and his allies have been preparing for them, trying to increase support for candidates which they back.

The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that Russia's arrests and detention of Mr Navalny in 2012 and 2014 were politically motivated and violated his human rights, a ruling Moscow called questionable.
