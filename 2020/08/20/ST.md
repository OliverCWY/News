越南外交部周四（8月20日）表示，中国轰炸机在南中国海有争议的西沙群岛中的存在“危害该地区的和平”。
越南和中国媒体报道说，中国最近向“西沙群岛”部署了战斗机和至少一架轰炸机H-6J，“西沙群岛”是中国声称拥有其历史所有权的南海两岛之一。
中国外交部向国防部转达了问题，国防部没有立即回应路透社的置评请求。
中国国防部发言人任国强上月底表示，H-6G和H-6J轰炸机已经参加了该地区的高强度训练。
中国今年还向沿海越南和马来西亚海域部署了巡逻船以及海岸警卫队船只。

HANOI (REUTERS) - The presence of Chinese bombers in the disputed Paracel islands in the South China Sea "jeopardises peace" in the region, Vietnam's foreign ministry said on Thursday (Aug 20).
Vietnamese and Chinese media have reported that China has recently deployed fighter jets and at least one bomber, the H-6J, to the Paracels, one of two groups of South China Sea islands that China claims historical ownership of.
China’s foreign ministry referred questions to the defence ministry, which did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment.
China’s defence ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang late last month said H-6G and H-6J bombers had participated in high intensity training in the area.
China has this year also deployed survey ships, along with coast guard vessels, to waters off Vietnam and Malaysia.

伦敦（路透社）-英国首相鲍里斯·约翰逊（Boris Johnson）的政府周四（8月20日）在处理数十万名学生的成绩后，在处理学校考试成绩方面面临新的批评。
考试委员会皮尔逊（Pearson）在周三晚间宣布，它将在学生收到成绩前几个小时重新计算BTEC的分数，与工作相关的专业资格。
它在一份声明中说：“我们已经开始担心不公平，包括与目前用于GCSE和A级考试的方法的一致性。”
尽管冠状病毒病例有所增加，英国的相关学校仍开始全额返还。
“这种无能为力的无休止模式无法统治一个国家。”

LONDON (REUTERS) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government was facing fresh criticism on Thursday (Aug 20) over its handling of grading for school exams after results for hundreds of thousands of students were pulled.
Exam board Pearson announced late on Wednesday that it would recalculate grades for BTECs, specialist work-related qualifications, just hours before students were due to receive their results.
"We have become concerned about unfairness, including consistency with the approaches now being used for GCSE and A levels," it said in a statement.

## “非致命”武器如何杀伤抗议者

### How 'non-lethal' weapons maim and kill protesters

伦敦（法新社）-从贝鲁特和巴格达到香港和明斯克的防暴警察经常使用所谓的“非致命”武器进行人群控制-那么为什么抗议者不断死亡和受伤？
随着全球街头抗议活动成倍增加，人权组织发出了催泪弹，橡皮子弹，电击枪和其他防暴武器的警告，造成了严重的伤亡。
但是恶意和过度使用，常常但不仅限于独裁国家，早已为防暴工具赢得了“低致命武器”的正式称号。
大赦国际说，它“监视了8月8日举行的大规模和平抗议活动，在那里催泪弹，橡皮子弹和抽气弹被鲁s地向人群发射”。
大赦国际说，催泪瓦斯在大量燃烧，在封闭空间内或在引发恐慌并引发人群踩踏事件时也远非无害。

LONDON (AFP) - Riot police from Beirut and Baghdad to Hong Kong and Minsk often use so-called "non-lethal" weapons for crowd control - so why do protesters keep dying and being maimed?
As street protests worldwide have multiplied, rights groups have sounded the alarm about tear gas, rubber bullets, stun guns and other anti-riot weapons causing serious wounds and fatalities.
But malicious and excessive use, often but not only in authoritarian states, has long since earned riot control tools the official designation of "less-lethal weapons".
Amnesty said it had "monitored the largely peaceful protests on 8 August where tear gas, rubber bullets and pump-action pellets were fired recklessly into crowds".
Tear gas, says Amnesty, is also far from harmless when fired in excessive quantities, in enclosed spaces or when it sparks panic and triggers a crowd stampede.

中国外交部周四（8月20日）表示，香港将暂停与美国的法律合作，这是对华盛顿终止与香港达成的一些协议的针锋相对的回应。
该协议于1997年在英国返回香港之前签署，其中明确规定，美国和香港政府将在刑事事项上互相帮助，例如转移被拘留者或搜查和没收犯罪收益。
香港政府发言人说，放弃这些交易将进一步“以香港为典当，在中美关系中造成麻烦”，“应受到国际社会的谴责”。
他说：“这将阻碍香港与美国之间航运业的发展，对任何人都没有好处。”
它还要求从香港进口的商品必须标记为“中国制造”，而不是以前的“香港制造”。

BEIJING (REUTERS, AFP) - Hong Kong will suspend some legal cooperation with the United States, China's Foreign Ministry said on Thursday (Aug 20), in a tit-for-tat response to Washington ending some agreements with Hong Kong.
The agreement, signed in 1997 before Britain returned Hong Kong to China, specified that the US and Hong Kong governments would help each other in criminal matters such as transferring people in custody or searching and confiscating proceeds of crime.
A Hong Kong government spokesman said abandoning the deals created further “troubles in the China- US relationship, using Hong Kong as a pawn”, and “should be condemned by the international community”.
“It will hamper the development of the shipping sector between Hong Kong and the US, and is in nobody’s interest,” he said.
It also required goods imported from Hong Kong to be marked as “made in China” rather than “made in Hong Kong” as previously.

新加坡（彭博社）-新加坡当局对当地一家会计师事务所的主管增加了两项额外指控，涉及与无耻的德国支付公司Wirecard有关的案件。
这些指控是针对这名54岁的新加坡人的四项类似指控，这是第一名因Wirecard倒闭而在城邦被起诉的人，Wirecard在世界各地回荡。
另一个指控说，同月，他歪曲了Citadelle在另一个托管账户中持有的3040万欧元。
6月，新加坡金融监管机构表示，他们正在与当地警察合作，以审查Wirecard案的各个方面。
去年，新加坡警察突袭了Wirecard的当地办事处，此前该州的一名雇员声称该公司财务团队的一名成员涉嫌会计违规。

SINGAPORE (BLOOMBERG) - Singapore authorities have added two additional charges against the director of a local accounting firm in relation to the case tied to disgraced German payments company Wirecard.
The accusations follow four similar charges against the 54-year-old Singaporean, the first person to be indicted in the city-state over the spectacular collapse of Wirecard, which has reverberated across the world.
The other charge says that the same month, he misrepresented that there was €30.4 million held by Citadelle in another escrow account.
In June, Singapore financial regulators said they are working with the local police to scrutinise aspects of the Wirecard case.
Last year, Singapore police raided Wirecard’s local offices after an employee in the city-state alleged that a member of the company’s finance team engaged in accounting breaches.
