SINGAPORE - Google is facing a global outage affecting many of its services, including e-mail, storage, document and videoconferencing.

Many users including those in Singapore have reported having difficulty accessing Gmail, Drive, Docs and Meet services even as they have become increasingly dependent on such tools for work amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

Ms Diana Low, an account director with local creative agency Splash Productions, said that she could not send attachments with her e-mails on Gmail from 2pm on Thursday (Aug 20). "The email text goes through, but the attachments don't. My colleagues are all experiencing the same thing," she said.

According to third-party Web monitoring company DownDetector, problems with Google services were first reported at around noon around the world on Thursday (Aug 20). DownDetector has so far recorded reports from more than 1,000 affected users here.

A live outage world map by the same firm showed that issues were mostly reported in Japan, India, parts of the United States, Europe and South-east Asian countries including Singapore.

Google confirmed on its website at 1.29pm that it is investigating an issue with Gmail. At 3.21pm, the tech giant updated that advisory, saying that it is investigating issues with Gmail sending, Meet recording, and creating files in Drive, among other things.

The Straits Times has contacted Google for comment.

Users can also check on the live status of its services here. When the button colours turn green, that indicates that the service should be working fine.
