拜登先生和哈里斯女士将在11月3日的选举中挑战特朗普先生及其副总统迈克·彭斯。
在为期四天的会议的压轴大会上，民主党总统候选人提名的拜登先生将在周四发表演讲。
她继续抨击特朗普先生，她继续说：“持续的混乱使我们漂泊。
奥巴马自卸任以来基本上避免了对特朗普的袭击，他指责奥巴马将美国轮值当做“另一场真人秀”来对待。
在白宫，特朗普回击说，他之所以当选，是因为奥巴马先生离开了美国人的“恐怖”。

Mr Biden and Ms Harris will challenge Mr Trump and his Vice-President Mike Pence in the election on 3 November.
The grand finale of the four-night conference will see Mr Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, deliver a speech on Thursday.
Attacking Mr Trump, she continued: "The constant chaos leaves us adrift.
Mr Obama, who has largely avoided attacks on Mr Trump since leaving office, accused him of treating the US presidency like "one more reality show".
At the White House, Mr Trump hit back that he was only elected because of the "horror" Mr Obama left Americans.

1955年至1994年，位于瑟索附近的Dounreay是英国发展快速反应堆研究的基地。
但是，核退役管理局表示，要在1英亩（148英亩）的场地可以安全再使用之前，要过2333年。
待拆除的建筑物包括独特的圆顶形Dounreay快速反应堆（DFR）。
从原型快速反应器（PFR）去除放射性物质的重要阶段预计将在未来三年内竞争。

However, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority said it would be 2333 before the 148-acre site is safe for reuse.
Buildings to be demolished include the distinctive dome-shaped Dounreay Fast Reactor (DFR).
Important stages in the removal of radioactive material from the Prototype Fast Reactor (PFR) are expected to be competed over the next three years.

## 为什么塑料废料是理想的建筑材料

### Why plastic waste is an ideal building material

塑料的处置是一个高度可见的全球性问题-从最高的山脉到最深的海沟，废塑料似乎不可避免。
在自然条件下，塑料几乎是坚不可摧的，但在世界范围内却被大量丢弃：全世界每年生产约3.59亿吨塑料。
这导致人们达成共识，即塑料是不可持续的材料。
主要问题不是以塑料为原料，而是我们的线性经济模型：生产，消费然后处置货物。
例如，英国每年使用500万吨塑料，每年仅回收370,000吨：仅7％。

The disposal of plastics is a highly visible global problem – from the highest mountains to the deepest ocean trenches, waste plastic seems inescapable.
In natural conditions, plastics are nearly indestructible, and yet they are discarded worldwide on a large scale: the world produces around 359 million tonnes of plastics each year.
This has led to a consensus that plastics are an unsustainable material.
The main issue is not with plastic as a material, but with our linear economic model: goods are produced, consumed, then disposed of.
The UK, for example, uses five million tonnes of plastic each year, and only 370,000 tonnes are recycled each year: that’s just 7%.

在这里，老挝人的健康也必须具有情感，精神和社会福祉。
“但是人们对精神世界的存在仍然抱有相当普遍的信念，尤其是在农村地区。
“为了举行仪式，所有家庭成员都必须在场。

视频内容视频字幕：学校部长尼克·吉布（Gick Gibb）对考试算法的担忧“放心”学校部长尼克·吉布（Nick Gibb）对考试算法的担忧“放心”早在七月。
他的老板教育部长加文·威廉姆森（Gavin Williamson）此前曾表示，问题在上周末变得“显而易见”。
吉布先生于2010年首次担任学校部长。他说，他已召集监管机构Ofqual和其他高级官员开会，讨论乔恩爵士提出的问题。
但他说，他“确信”该算法不会产生这种效果。
该算法将上周的A级成绩下调了约40％，导致公众的强烈抗议和对GCSE的担忧。

Video content Video caption: Schools Minister Nick Gibb was 'reassured' over exam algorithm concerns Schools Minister Nick Gibb was 'reassured' over exam algorithm concernsSchools minister Nick Gibb said he was warned about potential problems with the algorithm for moderating A-level and GCSE results back in July.
His boss, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, had previously said the problems became "clear" last weekend.
Mr Gibb, who first became a schools minister in 2010, said he had called a meeting with the regulator Ofqual and other senior officials to discuss the issues raised by Sir Jon.
But he said he was "reassured" the algorithm would not have that effect.
The algorithm downgraded around 40% of last week's A-level results, leading to a public outcry and concerns about GCSEs.

官方数据显示，上周美国失业救济金要求出乎意料地超过了100万。
劳工部表示，这一数字上升至110万，高于经济学家的预测数92.5万。
上周的数字为97.1万，是自3月份以来首次跌至百万以下。
3月份，首次索赔达到697万的峰值。
股票经纪人查尔斯·施瓦布（Charles Schwab）英国董事总经理理查德·弗林（Richard Flynn）表示：“今天初请失业金人数的增加将令市场失望，尤其是在上周的前景乐观的数据公布之后。”

First-time claims peaked at 6.97 million in March.

澳洲航空（Qantas）报告称，由于其应对冠状病毒大流行的影响，其每年损失近20亿澳元（10亿英镑）。
该公司还表示，预计在6,000个裁员计划中，大约有4,000个将在下个月底完成。
这是毁灭性的，对许多人来说将是一个生存问题。”澳洲航空集团首席执行官艾伦•乔伊斯（Alan Joyce）在一份声明中说。
除裁员外，还有20,000名澳航工人暂时停下来。
在其正常业务几乎遭到破坏之后，世界各地的运营商已宣布数十亿美元的损失和数以千计的裁员。

The firm also says around 4,000 of its 6,000 planned job cuts are expected to be finalised by the end of next month.
It's devastating and it will be a question of survival for many," Qantas Group chief executive Alan Joyce said in a statement.
On top of the job cuts a further 20,000 Qantas workers remain temporarily stood down.
Carriers around the world have announced billions of dollars of losses and tens of thousands of job cuts after the near-destruction of their normal businesses.

苹果老板蒂姆·库克泰克（Tim CookTech）巨人苹果公司已经成为美国第一家在股市上估值达到20亿美元（合1.5亿英镑）的公司。
其股价在周三美国早盘交易中达到467.77美元，使其突破了2tn大关。
唯一一家达到20亿美元水平的公司是去年12月上市的沙特阿美国家支持公司。
但此后，这家石油巨头的价值已回落至$ 1.8tn，苹果公司在7月底超越了它，成为全球最有价值的交易公司。
事实上，自三月份对冠状病毒大流行的恐慌席卷市场以来，其股价已自三月份的低点翻了一番。

Its share price hit $467.77 in mid-morning trading in the US on Wednesday to push it over the $2tn mark.
The only other company to reach the $2tn level was state-backed Saudi Aramco after it listed its shares last December.
But the oil giant's value has slipped back to $1.8tn since then and Apple surpassed it to become the world's most valuable traded company at the end of July.
In fact, its share price has doubled since its low point in March, when panic about the coronavirus pandemic swept the markets.
