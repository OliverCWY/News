莫斯科反对党领袖，直言不讳的克里姆林宫批评家阿列克谢·纳瓦尼（Alexey Navalny）周四昏迷不醒，在西伯利亚一家医院的呼吸机上因怀疑中毒而生病。
Yarmysh告诉俄罗斯俄罗斯电台Echo，他只有在起飞前在机场咖啡馆喝红茶。
Yarmysh补充说：“医生的回避反应只证实这是中毒的。”
亚尔米什告诉俄罗斯媒体Mediazona，纳瓦尔尼直到从托木斯克起飞后才显示出生病迹象。
Yarmysh告诉Echo：“他说他感觉不舒服，并问我要餐巾纸，他出了汗。”

Moscow (CNN) Russian opposition leader and outspoken Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny was unconscious and on a ventilator in a Siberian hospital Thursday after falling ill from suspected poisoning, his spokeswoman said.
He only drank black tea in an airport cafe before takeoff, Yarmysh told Russian radio station Echo of Moscow.
"The evasive reaction of doctors only confirms that this is poisoning," Yarmysh added.
Yarmysh told Russian media outlet Mediazona that Navalny had shown no signs of illness until after they had taken off from Tomsk.
"He said that he was not feeling well and asked me for a napkin, he had perspiration," Yarmysh told Echo.

苏格兰第一部长尼古拉·斯特金（Nicola Sturgeon）周四表示，该国的R数（即生殖数）“目前可能会高于1”。
一个人的繁殖率意味着每个冠状病毒患者平均会感染另一个人，因此高于一个水平的是每个冠状病毒患者感染另一个人以上的水平。
在过去的24小时内，又确认了77例冠状病毒病例，病例总数总计至少19,534例。
斯特金补充说，苏格兰目前的死亡人数为2492人，在过去24小时内没有新的冠状病毒死亡的报道。
不过，我们的R值范围最近有所增加，我们的最新估计表明它目前可能超过1值。”

Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Thursday that the R-number — or reproduction number — in the nation "could currently be above one."
A reproduction rate of one means each person with coronavirus will infect an average of one other person, so above one is the level at which each coronavirus patient infects more than one other person.
In the last 24 hours an additional 77 coronavirus cases have been confirmed with the total number of cases totaling at least 19,534.
The death toll in Scotland now stands at 2,492 and no new coronavirus deaths have been reported in the last 24 hours, Sturgeon added.
However, the range for our R-number has recently increased and our most recent estimate suggests that it could currently be above one," Sturgeon said.

（CNN）在2021年和2022年向佛罗里达礁岛地区释放超过7.5亿只转基因蚊子的计划获得了地方当局的最终批准，反对许多当地居民的反对和环境倡导团体的联合。
我们不知道，因为EPA非法拒绝认真分析环境风险，现在无需进一步审查风险，试验就可以进行。”
该试点项目于5月获得环境保护署的批准，旨在测试转基因蚊子是否可以替代喷洒杀虫剂来控制埃及伊蚊。
它是一种蚊子，携带多种致命疾病，例如寨卡病毒，登革热，基孔肯雅热和黄热病。
只有雌蚊叮咬血液，她需要使卵成熟。

(CNN) A plan to release over 750 million genetically modified mosquitoes into the Florida Keys in 2021 and 2022 received final approval from local authorities, against the objection of many local residents and a coalition of environmental advocacy groups.
We don't know, because EPA unlawfully refused to seriously analyze environmental risks, now without further review of the risks, the experiment can proceed," she added.
Approved by the Environment Protection Agency in May, the pilot project is designed to test if a genetically modified mosquito is a viable alternative to spraying insecticides to control the Aedes aegypti.
It's a species of mosquito that carries several deadly diseases, such as Zika, dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever.
Only the female mosquito bites for blood, which she needs to mature her eggs.

(CNN) On Tuesday, the Senate Intelligence Committee dropped a bombshell about Russia's interference in the 2016 election -- and its ongoing efforts to disrupt the 2020 contest as well.
* Manafort was working directly with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian intelligence officer, and tried to share internal campaign information with him.
These were just some of the findings of a bipartisan investigation in the Senate Intelligence Committee.
And that the two Russians from infamous Trump Tower meeting had more ties Russian intelligence than we previously knew.
And that Russia continued through this year to muddy the waters about its interference in the 2016 election.

（CNN）Airbnb正在大流行计划，仅在大流行使旅游业崩溃并迫使这家初创公司解雇其四分之一劳动力的几个月后才公开上市。
周三，Airbnb宣布已向美国证券交易委员会提交了机密文件，以进行首次公开​​发行。
Airbnb成立于2008年，它通过允许个人为旅行者出租房屋中的客房，颠覆了酒店业。
Airbnb此前曾表示，它在2017年和2018年实现了盈利，这使其与许多其他在上市前后都大赚一笔的独角兽公司区分开来。
他还宣布，Airbnb将在全球范围内放出1900名员工。

(CNN) Airbnb is moving ahead with plans to go public just months after the pandemic upended the travel industry and forced the startup to lay off a quarter of its workforce.
On Wednesday, Airbnb announced it had submitted confidential paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering.
Founded in 2008, Airbnb upended the hotel industry by allowing individuals to rent out rooms in their homes for travelers.
Airbnb previously said it was profitable in 2017 and 2018, setting it apart from many other unicorn companies who have bled money before and after going public.
He also announced that Airbnb would let go nearly 1,900 employees worldwide.

如果新的科学论据得到证实，那么登上飞机的风险可能会增加。
低传播风险乘客乘飞机捕捉Covid-19并因病毒丧生的几率不到百万分之一。
巴内特说，在确定总体传播风险之前，他已经考虑了所有这些可能性。
“从统计上讲，在满载的飞机上，靠窗座位比中间座位或过道座位要安全一些。
加强保护有些专家建议乘客应该戴好防护罩和口罩以加强保护。

If new scientific claims are borne out, the perceived heightened risk of boarding an airplane could be unfounded.
Low transmission riskThe odds of a passenger catching Covid-19 on a flight and dying from the virus are less than one in half a million.
Barnett says he took all of these probabilities into account before determining an overall transmission risk.
"Statistically, the window seat is a little safer than the middle seat or the aisle seat on a plane that's full.
Enhanced protectionSome experts have suggested that passengers should wear a shield as well as a mask for greater protection.

AMC是世界上最大的电影院链，在三月份关门之后，将于周四在美国重新开放100多个地点。
AMC AMC上周宣布了在开幕日仅售15美分的门票的消息。
纽约州州长安德鲁·库莫（Andrew Cuomo）周一表示，本月晚些时候，体育馆将在该州重新开放，但电影院将保持关闭。
但是从相对的规模来看，电影院并不是那么重要，而且风险很高。”
“电影院在必需品清单上的地位并不高。”

AMC, the world's largest movie theater chain, is reopening more than 100 US locations on Thursday after closing their doors in March.
AMC AMC made news last week when it announced it would sell tickets for just 15 cents on opening day.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Monday that gyms would reopen in the state later this month, but movie theaters would stay closed.
But on a relative scale, a movie theater is less essential and poses a high risk," Cuomo said.
"Movie theaters are not that high on the list of essentials."

（CNN）继加拿大队去年在总决赛上取得决定性的第六场胜利之后，多伦多猛龙队总裁马赛·乌吉里与旧金山湾区警官之间的争执已经出现了令人震惊的新镜头。
美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）获得的视频引发了有关警官-警长的副手艾伦斯特里克兰（Alan Strickland）声称乌吉里是交易所中的侵略者的质疑。
人体摄像机镜头从斯特里克兰德的角度显示了该事件。
在其中，看到Ujiri试图进入法院与他的团队庆祝。
其他视频显示，在允许乌吉里进入法庭之前，两人随后被分开。

(CNN) Dramatic new footage has emerged of the altercation between Toronto Raptors' president, Masai Ujiri, and a San Francisco Bay Area police officer, following the Canadian team's decisive game 6 victory in the NBA Finals last year.
The video, obtained by CNN, raises questions about a claim by the officer -- Sheriff's Deputy Alan Strickland -- that Ujiri was the aggressor in the exchange.
The body camera footage shows the incident from Strickland's perspective.
In it, Ujiri is seen attempting to gain access to the court to celebrate with his team.
Other video shows the two men then being separated, before Ujiri was allowed access to the court.

CNN正在展示The Conversation的工作，这是记者和学者之间的合作，旨在提供新闻分析和评论。
在超时期间，父母和其他监护人会暂时停止关注孩子，并使孩子安静地坐下来并保持冷静。
研究人员一遍又一遍地发现超时通常效果很好-只要父母和其他主要护理人员始终遵循五个特定步骤即可。
父母和孩子都需要每次都遵循所有这些步骤，以便超时工作。
但是，在大多数家庭中，我发现超时是有效的，因为年幼的孩子意识到打球和其他不当行为会带来不必要的休息乐趣。

CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation , a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary.
During timeouts, parents and other guardians briefly stop paying attention to their child and make the child sit quietly and calm down.
Researchers have found over and over that timeouts generally work well -- as long as parents and other primary caregivers consistently follow five specific steps.
Both parents and children need to follow all of these steps every time for timeouts to work.
In most families, however, I find that timeouts work because young children realize that hitting and other kinds of misbehavior will bring about an unwanted break from having fun.

内斯特了解到，除了成为研究对象的危害外，口呼吸还会破坏一夜安眠。
科学家发现，夜间通过嘴呼吸会增加您患睡眠障碍的风险，包括打，睡眠呼吸暂停和呼吸不足，部分空气阻塞。
这并不意味着您注定要发呆，因为您睡觉时容易口呼吸。
“即使您没有睡眠呼吸暂停或轻度睡眠呼吸暂停，张开嘴也会使这种情况变得非常严重。”
如果您要夜间夜间呼吸，Park建议您从照顾鼻子开始，以最大程度地减少交通堵塞。

What Nestor learned, aside from the hazards of being a research subject, was that mouth breathing can ruin a good night's sleep.
Breathing through your mouth at night puts you at higher risk for sleep disorders including snoring, sleep apnea and hypopnea , the partial blockage of air, scientists have found .
That doesn't mean you're doomed to wake up in a daze because you're prone to mouth breathing when you sleep.
"Even if you don't have sleep apnea, or you have mild sleep apnea, opening your mouth makes it much, much worse."
If you're tackling your nighttime mouth breathing, Park suggested you start by taking care of your nose to minimize congestion.

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-当通过吸引人的飞机制服吸引公众注意时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常是白色，但并不总是白色（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板可以应用最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，合并和收购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
