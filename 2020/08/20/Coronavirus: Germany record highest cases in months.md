Schools minister Nick Gibb said he was warned about potential problems with the algorithm for moderating A-level and GCSE results back in July.

His boss, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, had previously said the problems became "clear" last weekend.

But Mr Gibb told BBC Breakfast he was made aware of concerns by the former top official at the Department for Education, Sir Jon Coles, that poorer students could be disadvantaged by the system for moderating exam results.

The Times newspaper reported that Sir Jon, who is now the chief executive of a group of academies and fee-paying schools, warned Mr Williamson about potential problems six weeks ago.

Mr Gibb, who first became a schools minister in 2010, said he had called a meeting with the regulator Ofqual and other senior officials to discuss the issues raised by Sir Jon.

But he said he was "reassured" the algorithm would not have that effect.

The algorithm downgraded around 40% of last week's A-level results, leading to a public outcry and concerns about GCSEs.
