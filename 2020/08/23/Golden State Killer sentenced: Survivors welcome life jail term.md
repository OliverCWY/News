Joseph DeAngelo, the man known as the Golden State Killer, has been sentenced to life in prison.

He admitted 13 murders, as well as numerous rapes, burglaries and other crimes, in a deal with US prosecutors meant to spare him the death penalty.

The sentencing occurred in a university ballroom, to allow extra space for surviving victims and their families. Many have welcomed the jail term.
