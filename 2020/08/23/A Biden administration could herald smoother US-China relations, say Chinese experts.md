BEIJING - A United States led by former vice-president Joe Biden would be more predictable and smoother for China to deal with, Chinese experts have said, even though they expect a Biden administration to continue taking a tough line on Beijing.

They point out that compared with current President Donald Trump, Mr Biden would likely be more rational and return to high-level dialogue with China.
