波兰最高外交官说：“重要的是应将它们部署在波兰，而不是在德国。”
波兰的提振是特朗普政府计划的一部分，特朗普计划在上个月宣布从德国撤出约12,000名美军。
在冷战最激烈的时期，美国在欧洲维持了多达40万人的部队，其中大部分在德国。
主要行动包括从德国到比利时的指挥和控制中心，以及从德国到意大利的陆军空降部队和空军F-16战斗机。
Hertling指出，多年来，美国军方已花费数十亿美元使德国成为欧洲的中心地带。

"It is important that they should be deployed in Poland, and not in Germany," Poland's top diplomat said.
The boost for Poland is part of a Trump administration plan to pull some 12,000 US troops from Germany announced last month.
At the height of the Cold War, the US maintained up to 400,000 troops in Europe, the majority in Germany.
Key movements include command and control centers going from Germany to Belgium as well as Army airborne troops and Air Force F-16 fighters moving from Germany to Italy.
Hertling points out the US military has spent billions over the years to make Germany its central location in Europe.

Lavillenie, the previous world record holder who is 13 years Duplantis' senior, has never been shy of sharing tips and advice.

学校还将对参加社交聚会的现有学生采取行动。
Estabrook写道：“目前的学生可以期望从社区中撤离，包括立即失去大学住房。”
Estabrook写道，她的办公室直接与这些学生联系。
Estabrook写道：“我们自己的大学标准很明确：不遵循健康疏远规则的社交聚会使每个人的健康处于危险之中，并被严格禁止。”
据该州官方统计，自疫情爆发以来，截至周六，马萨诸塞州已确认115,850例Covid-19病例。

The schools also will take action against current students who partake in social gatherings.
"Current students can expect removal from the community, including the immediate loss of university housing," Estabrook wrote.
Estabrook wrote those students have been contacted directly by her office.
"Our own university standards are clear: social gatherings that do not follow healthy distancing rules put everyone’s health at risk and are strictly prohibited," Estabrook wrote.
As of Saturday, Massachusetts has had 115,850 confirmed cases of Covid-19 since the start of the outbreak, according to the state's official tally.

去年的这个时候，莫拉莱斯（Morales）只是一所公立学校的老师，他在教室里搭建教室，准备在上学的第一天拥抱孩子们。
它已经与不同的电视频道达成协议，以每天24小时，每周7天，每天不同的等级等级播放该内容。
大流行期间主持广播教育节目的鲁道夫·拉拉·庞特说：“对于这么大的事情，尚无先例。”
“但是，通过电视和广播课，这意味着不让教育差距扩大。”
注意差距“教育差距”是一种有礼貌的说法，富裕的孩子通常比贫穷的孩子得到更好的教育。

This time last year, Morales was just a public school teacher setting up his classroom, getting ready to hug his kids on their first day of school.
It has worked out agreements with different TV channels to broadcast that content, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, with different grade levels at different hours.
"There is no precedent for something this big," said Rodolfo Lara Ponte, who runs the radio education program during the pandemic.
"But by doing the TV and radio classes, that means not letting the education gap get wider."
Mind the gap"Education gap" is a polite way of saying that rich kids often get better educations than poor kids.

（CNN）-在大峡谷发现化石脚印并不是特别寻常。
但是，一位地质学教授的发现却比他想像的要大得多：他偶然发现的是在大峡谷国家公园发现的最古老的脊椎动物化石踪迹，大约有3.13亿年的历史。
罗兰德及其同事在星期三发表在《 PLOS》杂志上的一篇论文中记录了这一发现。
它们是地球上带壳蛋的动物（例如爬行动物）的最古老踪迹，也是脊椎动物在沙丘中行走的最早证据。”
悬崖坍塌后，露出了化石痕迹的巨石暴露了出来。

(CNN) — Finding fossil footprints at the Grand Canyon isn't particularly unusual.
But a discovery made by a geology professor turned out to be a bigger deal than he could have imagined: what he stumbled upon were the oldest vertebrate fossil tracks ever found at Grand Canyon National Park -- about 313 million years old.
Rowland and a team of colleagues documented the discovery in a paper published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One"These are by far the oldest vertebrate tracks in Grand Canyon, which is known for its abundant fossil tracks," Rowland said in a statement.
They are among the oldest tracks on Earth of shelled-egg-laying animals, such as reptiles, and the earliest evidence of vertebrate animals walking in sand dunes."
The boulder containing the fossil tracks was exposed after a cliff collapsed.

The first system to watch is Tropical Storm Laura, which is currently over Puerto Rico.
This system is expected to move northwest in the coming days and head toward Hispaniola and Cuba.
The second system, Tropical Storm Marco, is moving through the Yucatan Channel.
The storms could potentially interact with each other and that makes this forecast (or two) even more complicated."

美国司法部周五宣布，前陆军绿色贝雷帽被指控向俄罗斯特工提供有关美国国防的信息。
彼得·拉斐尔·德兹宾斯基·德宾斯（Peter Rafael Dzibinski Debbins）因涉嫌向俄罗斯情报人员发布有关他在美军服役之前和服役的化学和特种部队的详细信息而被捕。
弗吉尼亚东部地区的检察官说，德宾斯从1996年至2011年多次与俄罗斯特工会面，甚至还被俄罗斯情报人员分配了代号“ Ikar Lesnikov”。
迪宾斯还被指控签署了一份声明，据称该声明确认他想为俄罗斯服务。
“据称黛宾斯远没有做到这一点，并利用了他在军队和他的服务人员中的作用，使我们多年来的一名顶级对手受益。”

(CNN) A former Army Green Beret has been charged with providing information about US national defenses to Russian agents, the Department of Justice announced on Friday.
Peter Rafael Dzibinski Debbins was arrested for allegedly releasing details to Russian intelligence operatives about the chemical and Special Forces unit he was a part of before and while serving in the US Army.
Prosecutors with the Eastern District of Virginia say Debbins met with Russian operatives on multiple occasions from 1996 to 2011 and was even assigned a code name, "Ikar Lesnikov," by Russian intel agents.
Debbins is also accused of signing a statement allegedly affirming that he wanted to serve Russia.
"Debbins allegedly fell very short of that and exploited his role in the military and his fellow service members to benefit one of our top adversaries for years."

法官的命令星期一发布，但星期五由克利福德的律师在线发布。
克利福德（Clifford）在2018年起诉特朗普，寻求从NDA释放。
作为回应，特朗普及其法律团队在庭外同意不起诉或以其他方式执行保密协议。

The judge's order was issued Monday but posted online Friday by Clifford's attorneys.
Clifford sued Trump in 2018, seeking to be released from the NDA.
In response, Trump and his legal team agreed outside of court not to sue or otherwise enforce the NDA.
Monday's decision was a response to Clifford's efforts to be reimbursed for costs and attorney's fees related to the case.

如果Moderna没有招募足够数量的少数民族加入他们的队伍，则审判可能会推迟。

他说，少数群体参加试验应“旨在匹配疾病负担。
“在公司的支持下，临床研究机构正在其当地社区内工作，以达到多样化的人群。
以这种速度，该公司将在9月初至9月中旬轻松招募30,000名参与者。

The trials could be delayed if Moderna doesn't recruit sufficient numbers of minorities to join them.
Fauci said he wants minorities to be enrolled at more than double their percentages in the population because minorities have been disproportionately hit by the pandemic.
He said participation of minorities in the trials should "aim to match the burden of disease.
"The clinical research sites, with the support of the company, are working within their local communities to reach a diverse population.
At that pace, the company will easily enroll 30,000 participants in early to mid-September.

英国运输部长格兰特·沙普斯（Grant Shapps）周四在西班牙度假时因改变检疫规则而陷入困境，他表示，所有旅行窗口均可能突然关闭。
事实证明，这对潜在的旅行者以及旅行和旅游部门的人们都感到沮丧。
对于英国旅客和欧洲旅游业而言，潜在的一缕阳光是英国本周取消对葡萄牙入境者的限制，此举实质上打开了一个新的旅行窗口。
这是否会在两国之间造成旅行的复苏尚待观察。
查尔斯补充说：“问题在于检疫措施会扼杀旅行，并有效地告诉消费者边境已经关闭。”

Grant Shapps, the UK's transport minister, who was caught out by shifting quarantine rules while vacationing in Spain, on Thursday said all travel windows were subject to sudden closure.
This has proved to be a source of frustration for both potential travelers and those in the travel and tourism sector.
One potential ray of sunshine for the UK travelers, and for Europe's tourism industry, was the UK's move this week to lift restrictions on arrivals from Portugal, essentially opening up a new travel window.
It's yet to be seen whether this will create a resurgence on travel between the two countries.
"The problem is that quarantine measures kill travel, and effectively tell consumers that borders are shut," adds Charles.

The Indian Health Service, which is responsible for providing services to American Indians and Alaska Natives, is typically underfunded at between 50% to 60% of need, according to the National Council of Urban Indian Health .
Still, organizations that advocate for Black, Latino and Native Americans have been working during the pandemic to make sure their communities get the support they need.
The National Indian Health Board is demanding billion-dollar investments from the federal government for water and sanitation infrastructure and Indian Health Service facilities in tribal communities, among other priorities.

Hong Kong (CNN) Military watchers across the internet were provided with a rare sight after photos circulated this week that appear to show a Chinese submarine using an underground base on Hainan Island on the South China Sea.
The satellite image from American imaging company Planet Labs, first posted on the social media accounts of Radio Free Asia, shows what appears to be a Type 093 nuclear-powered attack submarine entering a tunnel to an underground berth on Yulin Naval Base.
Others made reference to the fictional Nautilus, from Jules Verne's novel "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea."
Satellite image of Aug. 18, 2020, appears to show a Chinese submarine using an underground base on Hainan Island on the South China Sea.
"That's unusual that a commercial satellite would be overhead at just the right time" on a cloudless day, he said.

这是一座引人注目的Vøringsfossen瀑布桥，这是一个新开放的旅游景点，在挪威西部的哈当厄尔（Hardanger）的埃菲尔峡湾（Eifjord）附近，可欣赏到壮观的风景，令人难以置信。
该项目由建筑师Carl-ViggoHølmebakk设计，已经进行了十多年。
Hølmebakk告诉CNN Travel：“桥梁当然是该项目的核心，它将河流和瀑布的两侧连接在一起。”
但是对于许多人来说，这座桥将成为参观Vøringsfossen瀑布的又一个理由，该瀑布已经是挪威的主要目的地之一。
人行道的设计与自然景观融为一体。

This is the dramatic Vøringsfossen waterfall bridge, a newly opened tourist attraction offering incredible views of the spectacular landscape near Eifjord in Hardanger, western Norway.
The project, designed by architect Carl-Viggo Hølmebakk , has been over a decade in the making.
"The bridge is, of course, the heart of the project, that connects two sides of the river and the waterfall together," Hølmebakk tells CNN Travel.
But for many the bridge will become yet another reason to visit Vøringsfossen waterfall, already one of Norway's top destinations.
The walkway is designed to blend in with the natural landscape.

While it's held on to its monopoly status as arguably the only local salad known to Singaporeans, rojak has in recent years been joined in restaurants by kerabu.

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-当通过吸引人的飞机制服吸引公众注意时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常是白色，但并不总是白色（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板可以应用最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，合并和收购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
