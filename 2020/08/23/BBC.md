设备上不支持媒体播放媒体标题冠状病毒：如何戴上口罩世界卫生组织（WHO）已发布指南，要求12岁以上的儿童应戴口罩，以符合其所在国家或地区成年人的建议做法。
它承认对儿童如何传播病毒知之甚少，但引用证据表明，青少年可以与成年人一样感染他人。
世卫组织说，五岁及五岁以下的儿童通常不应戴口罩。
“这对于与可能与儿童以及彼此密切接触的儿童一起工作的成年人特别重要。”
它说，年龄在60岁或以上的成年人或有潜在健康状况的成年人应戴医用口罩。

It admits little is known about how children transmit the virus but cites evidence that teenagers can infect others in the same way as adults.
Children aged five and under should not normally wear masks, the WHO said.
"This is particularly important for adults working with children who may have close contact with children and one another."
Adults aged 60 or over, or those with underlying health conditions, should wear medical masks, it says.

维尔济洛夫的前妻，活动家纳迪亚·托洛科尼科娃（Nadya Tolokonnikova）告诉BBC新闻，纳瓦尔尼的病情类似于她前夫的“中毒”。
她还对纳瓦尔尼先生所发生的事情表示惊讶：“我认为阿列克谢的权力是如此强大，以至于政治人物普京都不会干涉。”
纳瓦尼乘飞机飞往德国后，英国外交大臣多米尼克·拉布（Dominic Raab）发推文说：“对他的中毒进行全面而透明的调查至关重要。”
他自己的医生建议他可能已经接触了“某种有毒物质”，纳瓦尼先生说他认为自己可能已经中毒了。

Mr Verzilov's ex-wife, activist Nadya Tolokonnikova, told BBC News that Mr Navalny's condition resembled the "poisoning" of her ex-husband.
She also expressed surprise about what has happened to Mr Navalny: "I thought Alexei was so powerful as a political figure that Mr Putin would not interfere."
After Mr Navalny was flown to Germany, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab tweeted: "It is vital that there is a full & transparent investigation into his poisoning."
His own doctor suggested he might have been exposed to "some toxic agent" and Mr Navalny said he thought he might have been poisoned.

## 冰岛的福祉仪式

三个月前，在冰岛首都雷克雅未克，在午夜的阳光下，数百人在该市最大的游泳池外排队。
之所以兴奋，是因为由于Covid-19大流行，雷克雅未克的公共游泳池在关闭八周后重新开放。
电影制片人JónKarl Helgason说：“在游泳池和温泉中闲逛是一种民族消遣。”
在游泳池和温泉中闲逛是一种国家消遣。自1940年以来，儿童必须参加游泳课。
当我于2000年代中期住在冰岛，无法在明亮的夏日光线下入睡时，我制定了清晨前往当地泳池的习惯。

Three months ago in the Icelandic capital of Reykjavík, hundreds of people queued outside the city’s largest swimming pool under the blueish glow of the midnight sun.
The reason for the excitement was that Reykjavík’s public pools were reopening after eight weeks of closure due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Lounging around in swimming pools and hot springs is a national pastime,” said filmmaker Jón Karl Helgason.
Lounging around in swimming pools and hot springs is a national pastimeSince 1940, swimming lessons have been mandatory for children.
When I lived in Iceland in the mid-2000s, unable to sleep in the bright summer light, I developed an early morning ritual of visiting the local pool.

格兰德河畔奥拉杜尔村遗址上的铭文图像显示“烈士村”一词中的“烈士”一词被“骗子”代替。
1944年，该村被党卫军摧毁，有642名居民被杀。
像大屠杀之后一样，保留了旧村遗址。
格兰德河畔奥拉杜市市长菲利普·拉克罗瓦（Philippe Lacroix）表示震惊，他补充说：“我们知道这里发生了什么，但显然总有人在说谎。”
1944年6月10日，一支党卫军支队包围了法国中南部利穆赞地区的小村庄Oradour-sur-Glane。

Images of an inscription at the site in the village of Oradour-sur-Glane show the word "martyr" in the text "martyr village" replaced with "liar".
The village was destroyed by SS troops in 1944, with 642 inhabitants killed.
The old village's ruins are preserved just as they were after the massacre.
Philippe Lacroix, the mayor of Oradour-sur-Glane, said he was shocked, adding: "We know what happened here but obviously there are always people who try to tell lies."
On 10 June 1944, a detachment of SS troops surrounded the tiny hamlet of Oradour-sur-Glane in the Limousin region of south-central France.

Many have welcomed the jail term.

这项研究是在德国录得自4月底以来最高的Covid-19感染人数之后进行的。
周六三场音乐会中的第一场旨在模拟大流行之前的事件，没有采取任何安全措施。
“只要有被感染的危险，就不能举行大型音乐会，贸易展览会和体育赛事。
这就是为什么找出哪些技术和组织条件可以有效地降低风险如此重要的原因。”

The study came as Germany recorded its highest number of Covid-19 infections since the end of April.
The first of Saturday's three concerts aimed to simulate an event before the pandemic, with no safety measures in place.
"As long as there is a risk of infection, major concerts, trade fairs and sporting events cannot take place.
This is why it is so important to find out which technical and organisational conditions can effectively minimise the risks."

## 美国在小型贸易协议中赢得欧盟龙虾关税的终止

欧盟已同意取消对美国龙虾的关税，这是唐纳德·特朗普总统的主要优先事项。
特朗普先生曾威胁要提高欧盟对欧洲汽车的关税，如果欧盟不终止其龙虾关税。
作为美中贸易争端的一部分，中国对甲壳类产品加征关税，而在欧盟市场上，该行业在加拿大签署了2017年自由贸易协议后取消了对欧洲龙虾的8％关税后，对该行业失去了竞争优势。
美国新的协议将降低龙虾的关税五年，但仍需获得欧盟政府和欧洲议会的批准。
本月初，美国避免因为威胁欧洲对空中客车的补贴而提高关税。

Image copyright Getty ImagesThe European Union has agreed to eliminate tariffs on US lobster, a key priority of President Donald Trump.
Mr Trump had threatened higher tariffs on European cars if the EU did not end the lobster duties.
China slapped tariffs on the crustacean as part of the US-China trade dispute, while in the EU market, the industry has lost ground to competitors from Canada, after the country signed a 2017 free trade agreement eliminating Europe's 8% lobster tariffs.
The new US agreement, which would drop the lobster tariffs for five years, still needs approval from EU governments and the European Parliament.
Earlier this month, the US refrained from a rise in tariffs it had threatened over European subsidies for Airbus.

然而，尽管销售音乐的业务看起来更健康，但表演音乐的人以及使现场音乐成为可能的人们仍在遭受痛苦。
同时，一家创新公司找到了一种将现场音乐带给广大观众的新方法。
排练工作室“这是我一生中对现场音乐的最大敲门声，”伦敦国王十字区联合工作室的主任卡蒂亚·斯蒂芬森说。
经济衰退中的现场音乐通常是人们诉诸的事情。
Driift的Ric Salmon说：“不幸的是，回到世界的最后一件事将是任何规模的现场音乐。”

Yet while the business of selling music is looking healthier, the people who perform it - and those who make live music possible - are still suffering.
In the meantime, one innovative firm has found a new way of bringing live music to a mass audience.
The rehearsal studio"This is the biggest knock to live music in my lifetime," says Katya Stephenson, a director of the Joint studios in London's King's Cross area.
Live music in a recession is often the thing that people resort to.
"Unfortunately, the very last thing to come back in the world will be live music at any scale," says Ric Salmon of Driift.

在冠状病毒大流行期间，英国政府的巨额支出支持经济，这是英国政府债务首次超过2万亿英镑。
在休假计划等措施上的支出意味着债务数字现在等于英国一年内生产的所有产品的价值。
国家统计局（ONS）表示，7月份债务总额达到2.004亿英镑，比去年同期增加2276亿英镑。
7月份的借款数字（支出与税收收入之间的差额）为267亿英镑，低于6月份的修正后的295亿英镑。
Capital Economics的英国高级经济学家露丝·格里高利（Ruth Gregory）表示，7月份的借贷数字“又是一笔巨额款项，今年迄今的借贷额已达到1,505亿英镑”。

Spending on measures such as the furlough scheme means the debt figure now equals the value of everything the UK produces in a year.
Total debt hit £2.004tn in July, £227.6bn more than last year, said the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
The July borrowing figure - the difference between spending and tax income - was £26.7bn, down from a revised £29.5bn in June.
Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said July's borrowing figure was "another huge sum and pushes borrowing in the year to date to £150.5bn".
