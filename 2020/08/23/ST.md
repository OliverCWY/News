新加坡-一名56岁的新加坡妇女在技术教育学院（ITE）大学中心工作，是卫生部（MOH）周六（8月22日）确认的两起Covid-19社区案件之一。
这位56岁的妇女在星期五测试呈阳性，并在星期三症状发作后去上班。
新确认的两个案例与先前的55个案例相关联，在Sungei Tengah Lodge形成了一个新的集群。
印度国民和荷兰国民均无症状，分别在星期五和星期六测试呈阳性。
它补充说，这是在武吉班让综合交通枢纽发现一些Covid-19案件之后的一项预防措施。

SINGAPORE - A 56-year-old Singaporean woman who works at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) College Central was one of two community Covid-19 cases confirmed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Saturday (Aug 22).
The 56-year-old woman tested positive on Friday and had gone to work after the onset of symptoms on Wednesday.
Two of the newly confirmed cases were linked to 55 previous cases to form a new cluster at Sungei Tengah Lodge.
The Indian and Dutch nationals were both asymptomatic and tested positive on Friday and Saturday respectively.
It added that this was a precautionary measure after some Covid-19 cases were detected at Bukit Panjang Integrated Transport Hub.

汉城（韩国）说，遏制冠状病毒传播的更严格的社会疏导准则将从周日（8月23日）开始在全国范围内推广，因为它正在与从首都首尔传播的新的疾病爆发作斗争。
在首尔和一些周边城市，政府重新实行了与社会隔离的规则，包括限制大型聚会，禁止面对面的教堂聚会，同时关闭夜总会，卡拉OK吧，自助餐和网吧。
卫生当局将社会疏散规则分为三个阶段-第一阶段是最不紧张的阶段，第三阶段是最困难的阶段，敦促学校和企业关闭。
“如果我们将社会疏离准则提高到第三阶段，则不可避免地会给人们的日常生活和经济造成损害。
权先生说，韩国已提供抗病毒药物瑞姆昔韦治疗35家医院的143名患者，但由于供应商方面的问题，这种药物的获取一直是不规范的。

SEOUL (REUTERS) - South Korea said tougher social distancing guidelines to curb the spread of coronavirus will be rolled out nationwide from Sunday (Aug 23) as it battles a new outbreak of the disease spreading from the capital, Seoul.
In Seoul and some surrounding cities, the government has reimposed social distancing rules, including restricting large gatherings, banning in-person church meetings while closing nightclubs, karaoke bars, buffets and cyber cafes.
Health authorities have categorised social distancing rules in three stages – stage 1 being the least intense and stage 3 the toughest, where schools and businesses are urged to close.
“If we enhance the social distancing guidelines to the third stage, it is inevitable that they will take a toll on people’s daily lives and economy.
Mr Kwon said South Korea has provided anti-viral drug remdesivir to treat 143 patients at 35 hospitals, but access to the drug has been irregular due to issues on the supplier side.

Bellagraph Nova Group（BN Group）还表示，这些材料中的某些信息过早发布或包含错误，原因是路透社在与BN Group表示参与的公司和人员交谈时发现不一致之处。
据路透社周五检查的官方在线记录，没有一家名为Bellagraph Nova Group的公司在法国注册。
Bellagraph Nova Group的创始人是纳尔逊·卢（Nelson Loh）和特伦斯·卢（Terence Loh），他的身家大约为156亿美元。
纽卡斯尔联拒绝对出价或BN集团发表评论。
波旁说，当时在新加坡注册的Bellagraph Nova公司是母公司。

Bellagraph Nova Group (BN Group) also said some of the information in those materials was released prematurely or contained errors after Reuters found inconsistencies when speaking to firms and persons BN Group says it is involved with.
No company called Bellagraph Nova Group is registered in France, according to official online records checked by Reuters on Friday.
Mr Nelson Loh and Mr Terence Loh are co-founders of Bellagraph Nova Group that is worth an estimated $15.6 billion.
Newcastle United declined to comment on the bid or BN Group.
Bourbon said the Singapore-registered Bellagraph Nova company at that address was the parent firm.

中国专家说，由前副总统乔·拜登（Joe Biden）领导的美国对中国的应对将更加可预测和更加顺畅，尽管他们预计拜登政府将继续对北京采取强硬路线。
他们指出，与现任总统唐纳德·特朗普相比，拜登可能会更加理性，并重返与中国的高层对话。

BEIJING - A United States led by former vice-president Joe Biden would be more predictable and smoother for China to deal with, Chinese experts have said, even though they expect a Biden administration to continue taking a tough line on Beijing.
They point out that compared with current President Donald Trump, Mr Biden would likely be more rational and return to high-level dialogue with China.

我们支持总理穆希丁·亚辛的领导。”拿督斯里·阿兹敏在吉隆坡总理穆希丁出席的一次大会讲话中说。
前PKR副主席阿兹明（Azmin）先生与安瓦尔（Anwar）之间长达数年的争斗在过去几年中稳步发​​展，并在去年6月涉嫌涉及阿兹明（Azmin）与另一名男子的病毒性录像带之后转为私人。
安瓦尔曾两次因涉嫌与男人发生性关系而入狱，这是在穆斯林占多数的马来西亚的一项罪行。
Muhyiddin先生说，如果该提议被接受，他将被召集一次特别大会以修改Bersatu的宪法。
这次大会是由四个由阿兹明（Azmin）先生支持的非政府组织组织的，其中包括许多前PKR成员。

We support the leadership of Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin," Datuk Seri Azmin said in a speech at a congress attended by the PM Muhyiddin in Kuala Lumpur.
The years-long feud between Mr Azmin, the former PKR deputy president, and Mr Anwar had steadily built up over the years and turned personal after a viral sex video allegedly involving Mr Azmin with another man made its rounds in June last year.
Mr Anwar had twice gone to jail over claims of having sex with men, a crime in Muslim-majority Malaysia.
Should the proposal be accepted, Mr Muhyiddin said an extraordinary general meeting would be called to amend Bersatu's constitution.
The congress was organised by four NGOs backed by Mr Azmin and included many former members of PKR.

当唐纳德·特朗普总统在刚刚结束的民主党全国代表大会（DNC）上的首次详细公开讲话中画出了鲜明的战线。
他坚称，民主党有意窃取选举。
民主党同样确信，特朗普总统将有意窃取选举权，否则，如果他输了，他将不会接受选举结果。
特朗普在民意测验中落后于拜登。许多人认为，如果他输了，那可能是一笔微不足道的损失。
民主党支持并希望扩大邮寄选票，这是美国大选的常规做法。

as President Donald Trump drew stark battle lines in his first detailed public remarks on the just-concluded Democratic National Convention (DNC).
The Democratic Party was intent on stealing the election, he insisted.
The Democratic Party is equally convinced that he, President Trump, is intent on stealing the election - or will not accept the result if he loses.
Mr Trump is trailing Mr Biden in polls; many expect that if he loses, it may be a narrow loss.
The Democratic Party is in favour of and wants expansion of mail-in balloting, which has been standard practice in American elections.

与特朗普有联系的董事会于6月任命他为该职位。
DeJoy先生承诺继续USPS将选举邮件视为头等邮件的做法，并强调他将暂停进一步的更改，直到11月选举结束，以免对选举邮件产生任何影响。
德乔伊先生为延误道歉，但他还说，需要进行改革以使美国邮政总局保持财务稳定。
特朗普在8月14日接受福克斯采访时说：“如果我们不达成协议，那就意味着他们没有钱。”
“这意味着他们无法进行普遍的邮寄投票；他们只是无法进行投票。”

He was appointed to the position in June by a board of governors with ties to Mr Trump.
Mr DeJoy promised to continue the USPS practice of treating election mail as first-class mail and stressed that he would suspend further changes until after November's election, to avoid even the appearance of any impact on election mail.
Mr DeJoy apologised for the delays, but also said his reforms were needed to keep the USPS financially afloat.
"If we don't make a deal, that means they don't get the money," said Mr Trump on Aug 14 in a Fox interview.
"That means they can't have universal mail-in voting; they just can't have it."

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus对世卫组织日内瓦总部的记者说：“我们希望在不到两年的时间内完成这一大流行。”他坚持认为，驯服新型冠状病毒应该比1918年致命的大流行更快。
据法新社汇编的官方数据显示，迄今为止，Covid-19大流行已经杀死了全球近80万人，并感染了近2300万人。
这场大流行以三波浪潮来袭，最致命的第二波浪潮始于1918年下半年。
此后，大流行背后的流感病毒演变成致命性极低的季节性臭虫，这种臭虫已经流行了数十年。
瑞安说：“大流行病毒通常会随着时间的流逝而逐渐适应季节性变化。”

"We hope to finish this pandemic before less than two years," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters from the WHO's headquarters in Geneva, insisting that it should be possible to tame the novel coronavirus faster than the deadly 1918 pandemic.
The Covid-19 pandemic has to date killed nearly 800,000 people and infected close to 23 million worldwide, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP.
That pandemic came in three waves, with the deadliest second wave beginning in the latter half of 1918.
After that, the flu virus behind the pandemic evolved into a far less deadly seasonal bug, which returned for decades.
"Very often, a pandemic virus settles into a seasonal pattern over time," Ryan said.

习近平将中国的救灾工作称为“对我军领导指挥系统的实际检验”。
领导人试图让人们放心，政府正在尽其所能，但有些人可能会对此表示怀疑。
周五，官员们宣布，尽管三峡大坝保持警惕，但流入三峡大坝的速度有所缓解。
政府的新华社报道说：“长江中下游的防洪压力已经减轻。”
中国的另一条大河黄河也遭受了更多的洪灾。

Mr Xi called China's disaster relief efforts "a practical test of the leadership and command system of our army".
The leaders have tried to reassure people that the government was doing everything it could, but some might have doubts.
On Friday, officials announced that the flow into the Three Gorges dam had eased somewhat, though they remained on alert.
"The flood control pressure on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River has been reduced," the government's Xinhua News Agency reported.
China's other great waterway, the Yellow River, has also experienced more flooding.

Over 1m of snow had fallen in a number of alpine regions, and the cold weather would likely remain for several days, the bureau said.
