但权威人士说，现年71岁的内阁官房长官顺贺佳秀（Hoshihide Suga）是安倍晋三的可信赖副手，如果他选择竞选，很容易成为领跑者。
uga贺淳此前曾表示他不感兴趣，但自2012年12月上任以来，他一直是安倍晋三的最高政府发言人，在公众中得到了高度认可。
但当地媒体周六宣布将9月15日定为安倍晋三继任人的投票日期。
但是安倍晋三上周五突然辞职是由于长期病爆发，而他的任期将于明年9月到期。
现年63岁的前外交大臣岸田文雄（Fumio Kishida）曾经是安倍晋三的首选继任者，但人们开始担心他缺乏个人魅力和缺乏公众力量来填补安倍晋三的大任。

But pundits say that Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, 71, trusty lieutenant to Mr Abe, is easily the front-runner if he opts to run.
Mr Suga has previously said he was not interested, but has high public recognition as Mr Abe’s top government spokesman since he took power in December 2012.
But local media on Saturday floated Sept 15 as a possible date for the vote to decide Mr Abe’s successor.
But Mr Abe’s abrupt resignation on Friday due to a flare-up of a chronic condition comes a year before his term was due to expire in September next year.
Former foreign minister Fumio Kishida, 63, was once Mr Abe’s preferred successor, but concerns have emerged about his lack of charisma and public presence to fill Mr Abe’s big shoes.

吉隆坡-8月29日晚，总理穆希丁·亚辛（Muhyiddin Yassin）取消了备受期待的他的Perikatan Nasional（PN）联盟的启动，此前该国经历了数次挫折，使马来西亚最新的政治联盟正式化。
总理将于9月26日进行民意调查前访问沙巴，以选举马来西亚最东部州的新政府。

他说，这不是政治，而是现实……有点竞选活动，但不是真的，这是现实。

KUALA LUMPUR - Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin has called off the highly anticipated launch of his Perikatan Nasional (PN) alliance in Sabah on Saturday (Aug 29) night, after recently experiencing several setbacks to formalising Malaysia's newest political alliance.
The premier is visiting Sabah ahead of polls on Sept 26 to elect a new government for Malaysia's easternmost state.
The once dominant Umno prefers to contest under its decades-old BN flag in a tussle for leverage ever since Mr Muhyiddin was sworn in on March 1.

首尔（彭博）-韩国执政的民主党周六选举李娜容为新领导人，为前总理在2022年总统大选中可能竞购铺平了道路。
新任领导人在竞选演讲中说，他将“成功并制定”文在寅（Moon Jae-in）总统的政府政策。

SEOUL (BLOOMBERG) - South Korea's ruling Democratic Party picked Lee Nak-yon as its new leader on Saturday, paving the way for a possible bid by the former prime minister in the 2022 presidential election.
The new party leader said in his campaign speech that that he would "succeed and develop" the policies of President Moon Jae-in's administration.
Mr Lee, 67, takes the reins at the party with the nation battling a resurgence of coronavirus and soaring real estate prices, particularly in the capital, Seoul.
Mr Lee Jae-myung has hit out at Mr Moon's housing policies that have made homes unaffordable for working families in his province, which is South Korea's most populous.
Mr Lee Nak-yon, who was governor of South Jeolla providence, is known for his forceful exchanges as a lawmaker and his attempts to communicate directly with citizens.

日本首相安倍晋三（Shinzo Abe）即将离任，他以成为日本任职时间最长的领导人而感到自豪的遗产，但他勉强地拥有许多未完成的业务。
尽管如此，他仍可以回顾许多重大政变，包括他在美国撤军后领导经修订的《跨太平洋伙伴关系》（TPP）贸易协定取得成果所发挥的关键作用。

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will soon leave office with the proud legacy of having become the nation's longest-serving leader but reluctantly, with plenty of unfinished business.
Still, he can look back on a host of major coups, including the pivotal role he played in leading the revised Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact to fruition after the pullout of the United States.

ForwardKeys周三（8月26日）发布的数据显示，中国的国内航空旅行已从Covid-19大流行中几乎完全恢复，该数据预测中国的航空市场将在9月初全面恢复。
全球旅行数据公司ForwardKeys表示，在8月的第二周，国内到达中国机场的人数达到去年水平的86％，而航班预订量达到了98％。
“这是非常重要的时刻，因为这是自Covid-19爆发以来的第一次，全球任何地方的航空市场的主要部分都已回到大流行前的水平，”副总裁Olivier Ponti先生在一份声明中说，ForwardKeys的见解。
该公司表示，其全面复苏的预测基于四个因素：中国在遏制大流行方面取得了成功；国内航空座位容量将在8月的最后一周增加5.7％；学年开始时；和积极的价格促销。
中国航空市场在2月的第二周触底，此后一直缓慢攀升。

NEW YORK (XINHUA) - Domestic air travel in China has nearly fully recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic, according to data released on Wednesday (Aug 26) by ForwardKeys, which predicted the Chinese aviation market would fully recover by the start of September.
In the second week of August, domestic arrivals at Chinese airports reached 86 per cent of last year's levels, while flight bookings hit 98 per cent, said global travel data firm ForwardKeys.
"This is a highly significant moment because it is the first time since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak that a major segment of the aviation market anywhere in the world has returned to pre-pandemic levels," Mr Olivier Ponti, vice-president of insights at ForwardKeys, said in a statement.
The company said its forecast of a full recovery is based on four factors: China's success at curbing the pandemic; domestic aviation seat capacity set to increase by 5.7 per cent in the last week of August; the start of the school year; and aggressive price promotions.
The Chinese aviation market bottomed in the second week of February and has climbed slowly since then.

曼谷（彭博社）-泰国正在敲定一项计划，该计划将使寻求阳光退休的欧洲人有可能在该国度过即将到来的冬季，以挽救其陷入困境的旅游业。
对外开放是泰国遭受重创的旅游和接待业的生命线，该行业在没有外国游客的情况下五个月后仍在生存。
根据政府数据，2019年有超过670万欧洲人访问泰国，为泰国经济贡献了4610亿泰铢（201亿新元）。
在普吉岛，外国游客占游客总数的三分之二，但贡献了其旅游收入的90％。
“我们将首先允许少数外国游客进入该国，对我们的系统进行测试。”总理普赖特（Prayut Chan-o-cha）周三表示。

BANGKOK (BLOOMBERG) - Thailand is finalising a plan that would make it possible for retired, sun-seeking Europeans to spend the upcoming winter months in the country, in an effort to save its ailing tourism industry.
The opening-up is a lifeline to Thailand's devastated tourism and hospitality industry, which is struggling to survive after five months without foreign visitors.
More than 6.7 million Europeans visited Thailand in 2019 and contributed 461 billion baht (S$20.1 billion) to the Thai economy, according to the government data.
In Phuket, foreign visitors accounted for two-thirds of overall tourists but contributed to 90 per cent of its tourism receipts.
"We'll allow a small number of foreign visitors into the country first to test our system," Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said on Wednesday.
