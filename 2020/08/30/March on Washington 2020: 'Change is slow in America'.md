Thousands flocked to the Lincoln Memorial in the US capital to march for racial justice.

The event was dubbed the 'Get Your Knees Off Our Necks' march, and police brutality was top of many marchers’ minds.

The BBC spoke to attendees to see how far the country has come, and what’s left to achieve.
