(CNN) Norway's Alexander Kristoff won a crash-filled opening stage of the 2020 Tour de France after a sprint finish in treacherous conditions on Nice's Promenade des Anglais on Saturday, claiming the yellow jersey for the first time in his career.

The 156 km (97 miles) stage started and finished in the French Riviera's biggest city, but the unseasonable conditions with persistent rain saw a number of high-profile contenders hit the tarmac in bruising falls.

Kristoff was among the casualties but benefited from a "truce" called by leading riders in the peloton, which slowed dramatically for safety reasons, allowing victims of crashes to catch up and contest the finish.

It was only in the closing stages that racing began in earnest again, although a further mass crash just inside 3 km (2 miles) to go, left home favorite Thibaut Pinot among the casualties, the Frenchman getting up to finish the stage without serious injury.

UEA Team Emirates rider Kristoff used his experience in the finishing burst to take the honors from world champion Mads Pedersen of Denmark and Dutch rider Cees Bol. Seven-time green jersey winner Peter Sagan finished fifth in the dash for line.
