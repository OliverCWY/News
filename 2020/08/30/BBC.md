向成功者学习的渴望是一种自然的本能，但是如果我们不考虑“生存偏见”，这会适得其反。
生存偏差最著名的例子可以追溯到第二次世界大战。
一旦您熟悉了生存偏见的概念，就可以在任何地方发现它。
科学家似乎会成为一群不会幸存的偏见的牺牲品。
当社会将注意力转移到成功人士身上时，就会出现生存偏见的微妙来源。

A desire to learn from the successful is a natural instinct, but this can backfire if we don’t take into account ‘survivorship bias’.
The most famous example of survivorship bias dates back to World War Two.
Once you are familiar with the idea of survivorship bias, you can start spotting it everywhere.
Scientists would seem a group of people that wouldn’t fall prey to the distortions of survivorship bias.
A subtler source of survivorship bias appears when society turns its attention to successful individuals.

美国零售巨头沃尔玛表示将与微软合作竞购TikTok在美国的业务。
沃尔玛告诉英国广播公司，它认为与中国视频共享应用程序达成协议将有助于其扩大业务。
沃尔玛发言人向英国广播公司证实，确认该公司正在达成一项交易：“我们相信，沃尔玛与微软的合作伙伴关系将满足美国TikTok用户的期望，同时满足美国政府监管机构的担忧。”
微软在8月初证实它正在与TikTok进行谈判，它告诉英国广播公司“目前没有任何东西可分享”。
据报道，如果达成交易，TikTok的美国业务可能会获得高达300亿美元（220亿英镑）的价格。

Image copyright Getty ImagesThe US retail giant Walmart has said it will team up with Microsoft to make a bid for the US operations of TikTok.
Walmart told the BBC it thought a deal with the Chinese video-sharing app would help it expand its operations.
Confirming that the company was pursuing a deal, a Walmart spokesperson told the BBC: "We are confident that a Walmart and Microsoft partnership would meet both the expectations of US TikTok users while satisfying the concerns of US government regulators."
Microsoft, which confirmed at the beginning of August that it was in talks with TikTok, told the BBC it had "nothing to share at this time".
According to reports, TikTok's US operations could fetch as much as $30bn (£22bn) if a deal is reached.

中国科技公司的几位内部人士说，乔·拜登担任总统职位比特朗普总统再任四年更具吸引力-这将被视为“不可预测的”。
特朗普总统及其政府在有关中国的推文和新闻声明中谈到了这一点。
共和党海外游说团体副主席兼首席执行官所罗门·岳（Solomon Yue）表示，毫无疑问，在特朗普政府执政期间，“脱钩将加速”。
随着中美之间的紧张局势恶化，其他中国公司也将越来越多地效仿。
但这正是特朗普总统所说的需要改变的：他的政府认为中国已经变得更富裕，而美国却变得更穷。

Several insiders at Chinese technology firms say have told me that a Joe Biden presidency would be more appealing than another four more years of President Trump - which would be seen as "unpredictable".
President Trump and his administration talk about it in tweets and in press statements in relation to China.
Make no mistake, under a Trump administration "decoupling will be accelerated", according to Solomon Yue, vice chairman and chief executive of the Republicans Overseas lobby group.
Increasingly other Chinese companies are likely to follow suit, as tensions between the US and China get worse.
But that's precisely what President Trump says needs to change: his administration argues that China has become richer while the US has become poorer.

盖特威克机场说，由于大流行期间航空旅行崩溃，今年上半年旅客人数减少了1,470万人，即三分之二。
盖特威克机场（Gatwick）表示，尽管有复苏迹象，但它预计航空运输量和乘客人数仍将承受压力。
在截至6月的六个月中，盖特威克机场的旅客数量下降了66％，至750万。
他说：“我们准备搬家，我们准备投资，准备创造就业机会。
刚刚宣布，由于航空公司无法缩减规模，盖特威克航空将失去600个工作岗位。

He said: "We would be ready to move, we would be ready to invest, ready to create jobs.

这些工作将主要在其商店进行，但90个职位也将在其支持中心失去。
现在，它在英国的367家商店的营业时间比大流行之前要少得多，该公司已要求员工减少营业时间。
该公司曾警告称，将在6月份裁员1000人，但在本周完成重组协议后，这一数字有所上升。
行业机构UK Hospitality表示，尽管锁定措施有所缓解，但仍有大约三分之一的饭店和酒吧仍未营业，因为人们仍对这种病毒的传播感到担忧。

The jobs will mainly go at its shops, but 90 roles will also be lost at its support centre.
It 367 UK stores are now open for significantly fewer hours than they were before the pandemic, and the firm has asked staff to reduce their hours.
The firm had warned it would cut 1,000 jobs back in June, but that number has risen after it finalised a restructuring deal this week.
Industry body UK Hospitality says around a third of restaurants and bars have still not reopened despite the easing of lockdown, as people remain nervous about the spread of the virus.

由于所谓的“分布式拒绝服务”（DDoS）攻击，该交易所未能按计划在周五开放。
该交易所的网站被网络攻击所淹没，迫使其停止交易。
股市运营商NZX表示，其网络已因源自海外的网络攻击而崩溃。
DDoS攻击旨在通过向网站充斥大量请求直至其崩溃来使网站瘫痪。

The exchange failed to open as planned on Friday due to so-called "distributed denial of service" (DDoS) attacks.
The exchange's website was overwhelmed by the cyber attacks, forcing it to halt trading.
The stock market operator NZX said its networks had crashed due to the cyber attacks, which originated overseas.
DDoS attacks are designed to knock a website offline by flooding it with huge amounts of requests until it crashes.
