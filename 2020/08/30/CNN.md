美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）和一位高级政府官员的信说，国家情报局局长办公室已经通知众议院和参议院情报选择委员会，它将不再就选举安全问题进行简报。
这位官员补充说，其他支持选举安全的机构，包括司法部，国防部和国土安全部，打算继续向国会通报情况。
上个月，负责选举安全的最高情报官员比尔·埃维尼娜（Bill Evanina）也重申了向包括国会在内的主要利益相关方，包括政党和总统竞选活动提供“基于情报的稳健的简报”的承诺。
他写道：“我们认为中国更希望特朗普总统-北京认为这是不可预测的-不能连任。”
伊万妮娜还表示，伊朗正在寻求“破坏特朗普总统的美国民主体制，并分裂国家”。

(CNN) The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has informed the House and Senate Select Committees on Intelligence that it'll no longer be briefing on election security issues, according to letters obtained by CNN and a senior administration official.
The official added that other agencies supporting election security, including the Department of Justice, Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security, intend to continue briefing Congress.
Last month, the top intelligence official for election security, Bill Evanina, also reiterated a commitment to providing "robust intelligence-based briefings on election security" to key stakeholders that include Congress, along with the political parties and presidential campaigns.
"We assess that China prefers that President Trump -- whom Beijing sees as unpredictable -- does not win reelection," he wrote.
Evanina also stated that Iran is seeking to "undermine US democratic institutions, President Trump, and to divide the country."

（CNN）目击者称，圣安东尼奥市的一名黑人星期二在慢跑中被警察拦下并拘留，当时警察在附近的家庭暴力电话中搜寻嫌疑犯。
该事件在社交媒体上发布的视频显示，警察在该男子尖叫时将其强行推入警车。
报告说，军官阻止了奥梅图，并告诉他“有合理的怀疑，相信”他“与涉嫌勒死家庭暴力事件的描述相符”。
警方报告说，奥梅图在多次提出要求后拒绝提供他的名字和出生日期，他的“举止变得aggressive逼人”。
报告说，奥梅图拒绝进入巡逻车，然后经过“长时间的斗争”，才被“放进巡逻车”，​​“只用张开的手”。

(CNN) A Black man in San Antonio was stopped and detained by police Tuesday while he was jogging, witnesses said, as officers searched for a suspect in a nearby domestic violence call.
Video of the incident posted to social media shows officers forcefully shoving the man into a police vehicle as he screams.
Officers stopped Ometu and told him they had "reasonable suspicion to believe" he "matched the description of an alleged strangulation family violence incident," the report said.
The police report said Ometu refused to give his name and date of birth after several requests and his "demeanor became aggressive."
Ometu refused to get in the patrol vehicle and was then "placed in the patrol vehicle" after a "long struggle," the report said, "using only open hand techniques."

他还呼吁世界上身价最高的后卫曼联球员道歉。
联合声明说：“哈里的法律小组今天早晨对昨天的判决提出了上诉。”
“根据希腊的司法程序，提出上诉可以使法院的初裁无效，使定罪无效。
“根据希腊法律，我们的介入是在希腊司法系统接管时结束的。
根据希腊法院的判决，马奎尔立即被撤回，索斯盖特说：“这符合各方的最大利益。”

He also called on the Manchester United player, who is the world's most expensive defender, to apologize.
"An appeal against yesterday's verdict was lodged this morning by Harry's legal team," said the United statement.
"In accordance with the Greek judicial process, the filing of an appeal extinguishes the initial court verdict and nullifies the conviction.
"Our involvement was concluded when the Greek justice system took over, according to Greek law.
Following the verdict of the Greek court, Maguire was immediately withdrawn, with Southgate saying: "it was in the best interests of all parties."

Other cruise ships that have returned to the water in recent months have been significantly smaller, but still problematic.
In June, cruise giant Carnival Corporation announced plans to remove at least six cruise ships from its fleet.
Managing Director Peter Deer told CNN he sees the decision as a mark of confidence in the cruise industry.

但是现在，Covid-19带来的混乱和苦难暴露了我们的育儿标准多么不可能。
两本新书考虑了完美主义者的育儿对人脑的作用，以及对父母和孩子来说放松而富有同情心的育儿的样子。
第一，即使家人没有意识到，孩子也会感到压力较小，因为他们的家庭生活较少。
淡化完美主义者的养育的另一步骤是使父母的自我与孩子的表现脱节。
利亚希说，这种大流行可能会成为许多家庭的转折点，而没有希望。

But now, the chaos and suffering brought on by Covid-19 have laid bare just how impossible our parenting standards are.
Two new books consider what perfectionist parenting does to the human brain, and what a relaxed, more compassionate parenting can look like for parents and kids.
One, kids feel less pressure, even if they aren't conscious of it, as less of the family life is oriented around them.
Another step in toning down perfectionist parenting is to untangle the parental ego from the performance of the child.
The pandemic, Leahy said, could function as a breaking point for many families without, hopefully, all the breaking.

“人们会忘记的”虽然早就应该采取措施解决中国的食物浪费问题，但有人质疑政府广泛呼吁减少食物浪费是否能实现这一目标。

该范围使得Celera 500L能够为美国几乎所有配对的城市提供服务，而无需加油。
凭借其空气动力学机身，Celera 500L由RED A03发动机提供动力，因此所需的马力要小得多，以实现起飞和巡航速度。
“我们相信，当私人航空旅行的价格与商业航空旅行具有竞争力时，将产生巨大的市场机会。”
奥托航空公司还对Celera 1000L抱有远见，其中Celera 500L的规模扩大了20％，同时又保持了层流。
如果FAA认证和寻找制造工厂的计划按计划进行，那么我们可以看到Celera 500L在2025年之前首次实现商业交付。

The range is such that the Celera 500L would be able to service nearly every city pairing in the United States without refueling.
With its aerodynamic airframe meaning it requires a lot less horsepower to achieve takeoff and cruise speeds, the Celera 500L is powered by the RED A03 engine.
"We believe that when the price of private air travel is competitive with commercial air travel, an enormous market opportunity will result."

Can Charleston's tourism and true history co-exist with the recent attention to the Black Lives Matter movement and the current global awakening?
John Moore/Getty Images'Not everything is pretty here'Doug Warner, vice president of Media & Innovation Development at Explore Charleston, acknowledges the deeper truth of his aesthetically lovely city.
But he says the hard work of confronting racism had already begun for Charleston -- before 2020, Covid-19, protests and a resurgent Black Lives Matter movement -- and especially for the tourism industry.

（CNN）—人们正在为俄亥俄州木工的最新作品疯狂：一个迎合邻居松鼠的酒吧。
贴在他在希利亚德（Hilliard）后院栅栏上的“坚果棒”（Nutty Bar）看上去就像一个真实的棒子，甚至还带有许多坚果。
迈克尔·迪特科（Michael Dutko）正在建造The Nutty Bar。
Dutko在酒吧中最喜欢的部分是其怪异的浴室标志：“坚果”和“没有坚果”。
他立即申请了外观设计专利，现在正计划成立一家公司，以175美元至200美元的价格出售The Nutty Bar。

(CNN) — People are going nuts for an Ohio woodworker's latest creation: A bar that caters to neighborhood squirrels.
"The Nutty Bar," which is attached to his backyard fence in Hilliard, looks just like a real bar, and even has a range of nuts on tap.

Dutko's favorite part of the bar is its quirky bathroom sign: "Nuts" and "No Nuts."
He immediately applied for a design patent and is now planning to launch a business to sell The Nutty Bar for about $175 - $200.

（CNN）当您是整个大洋洲唯一一家濒临灭绝的凤冠企鹅受到照料时，这可能会有些孤单。
珀斯动物园（Perth Zoo）称，“皮埃尔（Pierre）”从印度洋或南大西洋的岛屿上大胆冒险，在澳大利亚西南部被发现被冲上岸。
由于他没有同类型的人玩耍，因此他喜欢孩子们关于一个叫做“ Pingu”的企鹅家族的陶醉系列。
他的看护人将视频放在iPad上，他蹒跚地看了看。
珀斯动物园说，凤冠企鹅是世界上最稀有的企鹅之一，据认为全球人口包括不到240,300对繁殖企鹅。

(CNN) It can be a little lonely when you're the only endangered rockhopper penguin being cared for at a zoo in all of Australasia.
"Pierre" made a daring journey from islands in the Indian or South Atlantic Ocean and was found washed ashore in southwest Australia, according to Perth Zoo .
Since he doesn't have any of his kind to play with, he's taken a liking to a children's claymation series about a family of penguins called "Pingu."
His caretakers pull up the videos on an iPad and he waddles over to watch them.
Perth Zoo says rockhopper penguins are one of the rarest penguins in the world and the global population is thought to include less than 240,300 breeding pairs.

每个地点都是独一无二的，但斯坦因茨注意到了一个共同的主题-人类正在改变地球。
在2018年《纽约时报》（New York Times）杂志派遣他到各个大洲记录气候变化之后，斯坦梅茨决定整理一本书，收集他整个职业生涯的图像。
“人类星球”记载了我们对环境的影响以及为保护环境而提出的解决方案。
偶然的环保主义者这种鸟瞰世界使Steinmetz能够见证并记录人类改变地球的方式。
这位摄影师说他不打算记录气候变化，但他的工作档案使人类的足迹不可否认。

Each location was unique, but the Steinmetz noticed a common theme -- humans were changing the planet.
After a 2018 New York Times Magazine assignment that sent him to every continent to document climate change, Steinmetz decided to put together a book, collecting images spanning his whole career.
"Human Planet" chronicles our impact on the environment and the solutions we have come up with to try to save it.
The accidental environmentalistThis bird's-eye view of the world allowed Steinmetz to witness -- and document -- the ways humans have changed the planet.
The photographer says he didn't intend to document climate change, but his archive of work made humanity's footprint undeniable.

## 画飞机：为什么每一层都很重要

### Painting an airplane: Why every layer counts

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-通过吸引人的飞机制服吸引公众注意力时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常为白色，但并非总是如此（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板应用了最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，合并和收购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
