安倍晋三表示，复发使现有药物无效，因此，他将需要更多治疗。
共同社援引消息人士的话援引安倍晋三的话说，该病需要治疗，该病一直通过药物控制，但最近又复发了。
自民党高管引述安倍先生对党员的话说：“由于疾病我将无法作出适当的判断。”
内阁官房长官杉谷佳秀（Soshi Yidehide Suga）在周四接受彭博社采访时表示，他希望安倍晋三能够继续任职。
他还担任任期最长的总理，包括他从2006年到2007年的第一届任期，之后他因病病突然辞职。

Mr Abe said the relapse rendered existing medication ineffective and hence, he will need more treatment.
Kyodo News cited a source as quoting Mr Abe as saying that treatment was needed for the condition, which was kept under control with medication but has recently recurred.
"I will not be able to make proper judgments due to illness," Mr Abe was quoted by an LDP executive as telling party members.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga had told Bloomberg in an interview on Thursday that he expects Mr Abe to serve out his term.
He also holds the record for the longest-serving prime minister, including his first term from 2006 to 2007, before he abruptly resigned over ill health.

安倍晋三多年来一直与慢性溃疡性结肠炎作斗争。
TARO ASOF现年79岁的财务大臣麻生二郎也曾担任副首相，是安倍晋三政府的核心成员。
如果对谁应该接任安倍晋三没有明确的共识，自民党议员可能会在安倍晋三辞职后选举麻生晋三为临时领导人。
麻生太郎是前任总理的孙子，他将政策经验与对漫画漫画的爱好以及对撒谎的倾向相结合。
回到安倍晋三后，安倍晋三任命S内一郎为内阁官房长官，担任政府最高发言人，负责协调政策并使官僚机构保持一致。

Mr Abe has battled the chronic disease ulcerative colitis for years.
TARO ASOFinance Minister Aso, 79, who also doubles as deputy prime minister, has been a core member of Mr Abe's administration.
Without a clear consensus on who should succeed Mr Abe, LDP lawmakers could elect Mr Aso as a temporary leader if Mr Abe resigns.
The grandson of a former premier, Mr Aso mixes policy experience with a fondness for manga comics and a tendency towards gaffes.
Back in office, Mr Abe tapped Mr Suga as chief Cabinet secretary, acting as top government spokesman, coordinating policies and keeping bureaucrats in line.

吉隆坡-马来西亚总理穆希丁·亚辛（Muhyiddin Yassin）周五（8月28日）表示，该国的运动遏制措施将延长至12月31日，因为冠状病毒大流行并未显示任何结束的迹象。
他说：“尽管我们已经很好地处理了危机……为了每个人的利益，政府已决定将恢复MCO的期限延长至2020年12月31日。”
他说：“为避免发生进口案件，游客仍不被允许进入该国。”
马来西亚于3月18日首次实施了运动遏制，迫使学校和非必要企业关闭。
这引起了公众的愤怒，因为其他马来西亚人因违反检疫规定而被罚款甚至入狱。

KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysia’s Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said on Friday (Aug 28) that the country’s movement curbs will be extended to Dec 31, as the coronavirus pandemic isn’t showing any signs of ending soon.
“Although we have handled the crisis well... in the interest of everyone, the government has decided that the recovery MCO will be extended to Dec 31, 2020,” he said.
“Tourists are still not allowed to enter the country to avoid import cases,” he said.
Malaysia first imposed the movement curbs on March 18, forcing schools and non-essential businesses to shut down.
This raised public anger as other Malaysians had been fined and even jailed, for violating the quarantine.

中国外交部发言人赵立建周五（8月28日）表示，华盛顿正在破坏和平与稳定，并在南中国海制造麻烦。
赵先生周五说，中国在南海的演习没有针对任何国家，与这些海域的领土争端无关。

BEIJING - Washington is destroying peace and stability, and stirring trouble in the South China Sea, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Friday (Aug 28).
Mr Zhao on Friday said China's drills in the South China Sea were not targeted at any country and were unrelated to the territorial disputes in those waters.
The United States should stop making trouble and sowing discord, and play a constructive role in maintaining regional peace and stability in the South China Sea."

新加坡-Covid-19时代的面罩是什么构成的？
随着Covid-19疲劳的到来，戴口罩会更像是一种时尚宣言，而不是某些人的健康要求吗？
杜克大学的研究比较了各种口罩中的液滴散布情况，发现大多数液滴都提供了很好的保护。
但是，研究结果还发现，被测试的15种类型之一比完全不戴口罩要糟糕。
这是由92％的聚酯纤维和8％的氨纶制成的单层颈围。

SINGAPORE - What constitutes a face mask in the time of Covid-19?
Would the wearing of mask, as Covid-19 fatigue sets in, become more of a fashion statement rather than a health requirement for some?
The Duke study, which compared the spread of droplets from a range of masks, found that most of them gave fairly good protection.
However, the results of the study also found that one of the 15 types tested proved to be worse than not wearing a mask at all.
This was a single layer neck gaiter made of 92 per cent polyester and 8 per cent spandex.

奥斯陆（路透社）-中国政府最高外交官国务委员王毅周四（8月27日）表示，目前尚不清楚冠状病毒是否最初起源于中国，这使卫生专家和外国政府的观点产生了疑问。
王健在访问挪威时说，虽然中国是第一个向世界卫生组织报告该病毒存在的国家，但“这并不意味着该病毒起源于中国”。
“病毒首先从何处开始以及如何开始……应该留​​给科学家和医学专家……
它不应该政治化或受到污名化。”
这仍然是未知数。

OSLO (REUTERS) - The Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, said on Thursday (Aug 27) that it was unclear whether the coronavirus had first originated in China, casting doubt on the views of health experts and foreign governments.
Speaking during a visit to Norway, Mr Wang said that while China was the first country to report the existence of the virus to the World Health Organisation (WHO), "it does not mean that the virus originated in China".
"Where did the virus first start and how it started... should be left to scientists and medical experts...
It should not politicised or stigmatised," said Mr Wang, in an apparent rebuke of United States President Donald Trump, who has been criticised for describing the coronavirus as the "China virus".
It is still unknown," said Mr Wang, who was visiting Norway after visiting the Netherlands and Italy earlier this week, in the first visit to Norway by a Chinese foreign minister since 2006.
