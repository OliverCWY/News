（CNN）白宫先前引用的一种著名的冠状病毒模型预测，到12月，美国将有317,000多人死于Covid-19。
周四发布的预测预测，到9月19日将有200,292人死亡，可能的死亡范围为195,824至207,269。
“国家和地区的整体预报预测，在18个司法管辖区，每周报告的新死亡人数可能会减少。
信中说：“这种突然的变化并没有赋予公共卫生专业人员以凝聚力，使我们的国家向前发展以应对这种大流行，而是造成了混乱，惊ster，并破坏了该机构在公共卫生专业人员和公众之间的信誉。”
“这一修订及其产生的影响为公共卫生从业人员有效应对这一流行病增加了又一障碍。”

(CNN) A well-known coronavirus model previously cited by the White House forecasts more than 317,000 US deaths from Covid-19 by December.
The projections published Thursday forecast 200,292 deaths by September 19, with a possible range of 195,824 to 207,269 deaths.
"State- and territory-level ensemble forecasts predict that the number of reported new deaths per week may decrease in 18 jurisdictions.
"Rather than empowering public health professionals and moving our nation forward in a cohesive way to address the pandemic, this abrupt change has caused confusion, consternation and undermined the credibility of the agency with public health professionals and the public alike," the letter says.
"This revision and its resulting impact is adding yet another obstacle for public health practitioners to effectively address the pandemic."

但我们也知道它们具有很好的适应能力。”
但是受到冠状病毒感染的欧洲国家的反应非常冷淡，移民被迫返回或被拘留在人满为患，不卫生的环境中。
来自德国非政府组织“海洋观察”组织的费利克斯·魏斯（Felix Weiss）告诉美国有线电视新闻网（CNN），他了解大流行期间已经在苦苦挣扎的企业的愤怒。
噩梦般的状况魏斯说，由于意大利和马耳他等国封锁船只并拒绝采取行动，在封锁期间进行营救已成为“噩梦”。
Cosse告诉CNN，移民在岛上的难民营已经被隔离了几个月，该岛的能力是其24,000多名居民的四倍。

But we also know they're very adaptable," UNHCR spokesman Charlie Yaxley told CNN.
But the response from European countries burdened by coronavirus has been icy, with migrants forced back or detained in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions.
Felix Weiss, from the German NGO Sea Watch, told CNN he understood the anger from businesses already struggling during the pandemic.
'Nightmare' situationWeiss said conducting rescues had become "a nightmare" during lockdown because of countries including Italy and Malta blocking boats and refusing to act themselves.
Cosse told CNN that migrants had been quarantined for months at island camps, which are at four times their capacity with more than 24,000 residents.

波哥大（CNN）哥伦比亚希望在偏远的农村地区继续空中喷洒一种有毒化学物质，以阻止可卡因的增长，可卡因是可卡因的主要成分，尽管存在严重的健康问题。
一次“有毒的雾气”空中熏蒸使当局能够将非法古柯作物瞄准哥伦比亚难以到达且常常是危险的角落。
安提奥基亚（Antioquia）农村的农民何塞·大卫·埃尔南德斯（Jose David Hernandez）直到2018年都种植古柯，他还记得2003年和2004年的空中熏蒸。
2008年，厄瓜多尔向国际法院提起诉讼，指控哥伦比亚在其联合边界附近进行空中喷洒正在损害其自然环境。
美国国务院在给美国有线电视新闻网的声明中说，美国支持所有根除工具，包括空中熏蒸。

Bogota (CNN) Colombia wants to resume aerial spraying of a toxic chemical in remote rural areas to stop the growth of coca, the chief ingredient of cocaine -- despite stark health concerns.
'A toxic fog'Aerial fumigation allowed authorities to target illegal coca crops in hard-to-reach and often dangerous corners of Colombia.
Jose David Hernandez, a farmer in rural Antioquia, who grew coca until 2018, remembers the aerial fumigations in 2003 and 2004.
In 2008, Ecuador brought a case to the International Court of Justice alleging Colombia's aerial spraying near their joint border was harming its own natural environment.
In a statement to CNN, the Department of State said the US supported all eradication tools, including aerial fumigations.

The intercept took place amid heightened tensions between the US and Russian militaries, tensions that were thrust onto center stage this week when a collision between American and Russian military vehicles in Syria injured seven US service members and led Moscow and Washington to blame each other for the incident.

但是现在，Covid-19带来的混乱和苦难暴露了我们的育儿标准多么不可能。
两本新书考虑了完美主义者的育儿对人脑的作用，以及对父母和孩子来说放松而富有同情心的育儿的样子。
第一，即使家人没有意识到，孩子也会感到压力较小，因为他们的家庭生活较少。
淡化完美主义者的养育的另一步骤是使父母的自我与孩子的表现脱节。
利亚希说，这种大流行可能会成为许多家庭的转折点，而没有希望。

But now, the chaos and suffering brought on by Covid-19 have laid bare just how impossible our parenting standards are.
Two new books consider what perfectionist parenting does to the human brain, and what a relaxed, more compassionate parenting can look like for parents and kids.
One, kids feel less pressure, even if they aren't conscious of it, as less of the family life is oriented around them.
Another step in toning down perfectionist parenting is to untangle the parental ego from the performance of the child.
The pandemic, Leahy said, could function as a breaking point for many families without, hopefully, all the breaking.

该范围使得Celera 500L能够为美国几乎所有配对的城市提供服务，而无需加油。
凭借其空气动力学机身，Celera 500L由RED A03发动机提供动力，因此所需的马力要小得多，以实现起飞和巡航速度。
“我们相信，当私人航空旅行的价格与商业航空旅行具有竞争力时，将产生巨大的市场机会。”
奥托航空公司还对Celera 1000L抱有远见，其中Celera 500L的规模扩大了20％，同时又保持了层流。
如果FAA认证和寻找制造工厂的计划按计划进行，那么我们可以看到Celera 500L在2025年之前首次实现商业交付。

The range is such that the Celera 500L would be able to service nearly every city pairing in the United States without refueling.
With its aerodynamic airframe meaning it requires a lot less horsepower to achieve takeoff and cruise speeds, the Celera 500L is powered by the RED A03 engine.
"We believe that when the price of private air travel is competitive with commercial air travel, an enormous market opportunity will result."

"Human Planet" chronicles our impact on the environment and the solutions we have come up with to try to save it.

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-通过吸引人的飞机制服吸引公众注意力时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常为白色，但并非总是如此（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板应用了最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，合并和收购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
