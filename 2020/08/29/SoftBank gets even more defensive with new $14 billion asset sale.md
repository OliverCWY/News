Hong Kong (CNN Business) One of the world's biggest tech investors is raising billions more in cash by selling assets in a bid to protect itself from possible future waves of the coronavirus pandemic.

Masayoshi Son's SoftBank Group said Friday that it is selling down its stake in its Japanese mobile carrier affiliate, SoftBank Corp.

will sell more than one million shares in SoftBank Corp. worth 1.47 trillion yen (nearly $14 billion). The offering would reduce SoftBank Group's stake in the carrier company from 62% to 40%.

SoftBank Group shares closed down 3% in Tokyo on Friday.

The sale comes even as global markets have recovered from the crash earlier this year caused by the pandemic. Tech stocks on Wall Street are hitting record highs and their founders' wealth is ballooning

But in its statement announcing the stake sale, SoftBank noted "ongoing uncertainty in the market environment due to concerns about a potential second or even third wave of Covid-19."

The company had already announced plans back in March to raise some 4.5 trillion yen ($43 billion) by selling assets . The mobile carrier sale is on top of that.

SoftBank Group "believes it is necessary to expand cash reserves beyond [that amount] to ensure flexible options to respond to changes in the market environment," the company said Friday.
