基诺沙（Kenosha）的警察曾说，布雷克（Blake）先生因先前的逮捕令而被拘留，手铐是政策。
布莱克先生被警察枪击七次后瘫痪，目前尚不清楚他是否会再次行走。
同时，法庭针对一名涉嫌在布雷克枪击案动乱期间杀死两人的少年进行了聆讯，被推迟了一个月。
布雷克的父亲也叫雅各布·布雷克（Jacob Blake），在医院探望儿子后向记者讲话。
周五，布雷克的律师帕特里克·卡弗蒂（Patrick Cafferty）告诉美国媒体，布雷克已从手铐中释放，并且针对他的未清手令已被撤职。

Police in Kenosha had said that Mr Blake was in custody for previous warrants and the handcuffs were policy.
Mr Blake was paralysed after being shot seven times by police and it is not clear if he will walk again.
Meanwhile, a court hearing for a teenager charged with killing two people during unrest over Mr Blake's shooting has been delayed by a month.
Mr Blake's father, also called Jacob Blake, spoke to reporters after visiting his son in hospital.
On Friday, Mr Blake's attorney, Patrick Cafferty, told US media that Mr Blake was released from handcuffs and the outstanding warrants against him had been vacated.

美国零售巨头沃尔玛表示将与微软合作竞购TikTok在美国的业务。
沃尔玛告诉英国广播公司，它认为与中国视频共享应用程序达成协议将有助于其扩大业务。
沃尔玛发言人向英国广播公司证实，确认该公司正在达成一项交易：“我们相信，沃尔玛与微软的合作伙伴关系将满足美国TikTok用户的期望，同时满足美国政府监管机构的担忧。”
微软在8月初证实它正在与TikTok进行谈判，它告诉英国广播公司“目前没有任何东西可分享”。
据报道，如果达成交易，TikTok在美国的业务可能会获得高达300亿美元（220亿英镑）的价格。

Image copyright Getty ImagesThe US retail giant Walmart has said it will team up with Microsoft to make a bid for the US operations of TikTok.
Walmart told the BBC it thought a deal with the Chinese video-sharing app would help it expand its operations.
Confirming that the company was pursuing a deal, a Walmart spokesperson told the BBC: "We are confident that a Walmart and Microsoft partnership would meet both the expectations of US TikTok users while satisfying the concerns of US government regulators."
Microsoft, which confirmed at the beginning of August that it was in talks with TikTok, told the BBC it had "nothing to share at this time".
According to reports, TikTok's US operations could fetch as much as $30bn (£22bn) if a deal is reached.

这位21岁的球员成为T20半个世纪以来得分最低的英格兰球员，因为他打了四分之四和五分之六。
他的离开是四个小门中第一个下降14跑的地方，不久之后雨水在16.1失误之后与英格兰131-6进行了干涉。
班顿在英格兰的挣扎中眼花Ban乱班顿是县赛道上最具破坏性的限量接球板球运动员之一，他在一天的比赛和T20板球比赛中为英格兰开场的九场比赛中仅有50场表演。
班顿（Banton）自从11月在新西兰首次亮相英格兰以来，在三场T20比赛中只完成了56次跑步。
“我当时在巴基斯坦参加PSL（巴基斯坦超级联赛），但表现不佳，所以我有点担心进入这场比赛。

The 21-year-old became the youngest England player to score a T20 half-century as he hit four fours and five sixes.
His departure was the first of four wickets to fall for 14 runs, shortly before rain intervened with England 131-6 after 16.1 overs.
Banton dazzles amid England struggleOne of the most devastating limited-overs batsmen on the county circuit, Banton had a solitary fifty to show from his opening nine games for England in one-day and T20 cricket.
Banton had managed only 56 runs in three T20s since making his England debut in New Zealand in November.
"I was in Pakistan for the PSL (Pakistan Super League) and didn't do that well, so I was a bit worried coming into this game.

世界反兴奋剂机构（和田）对被解雇表示关注。
加努斯三年前被任命为执行多次兴奋剂丑闻后清理俄罗斯体育的使命。
BBC莫斯科通讯社记者萨拉·雷恩斯福德（Sarah Rainsford）表示，证明俄罗斯的反兴奋剂机构完全独立将是推翻它的关键条件。
俄罗斯奥委会主席斯坦尼斯拉夫·波兹尼亚科夫（Stanislav Pozdnyakov）告诉记者，罢免加努斯的决定是一致的。
后来，加努斯先生证实某人已更改或删除了“数千”个条目。

The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) has voiced concern at his dismissal.
Mr Ganus was appointed three years ago on a mission to clean up Russian sport after multiple doping scandals.
BBC Moscow correspondent Sarah Rainsford says that proving Russia's anti-doping agency is fully independent would be a key condition for overturning it.
Stanislav Pozdnyakov, president of the Russian Olympic Committee, told reporters the decision to dismiss Mr Ganus had been unanimous.
Mr Ganus later confirmed that someone had altered or deleted "thousands" of entries.

上周五，他们被指控违反了洛杉矶县更安全的家庭秩序和一项禁止大型喧闹派对的城市法律。
在新闻发布会上，福尔先生说，家庭聚会是冠状病毒潜在的“超级传播者事件”。
本月初，洛杉矶市长埃里克·加塞蒂（Eric Garcetti）表示，家庭聚会已成为“山上的夜总会”。
洛杉矶县继续报告该州感染人数最多的地区-截至上周五，已达到237,000。

At a news conference, Mr Feuer said that house parties were potential "super-spreader events" for the coronavirus.
Earlier this month, LA Mayor Eric Garcetti said house parties had become "nightclubs in the hills".
Los Angeles county continues to report the highest number of infections in the state - 237,000 as of Friday.

## 特朗普还是拜登？中国希望这两种方式都不对

中国科技公司的几位内部人士说，乔·拜登担任总统职位比特朗普总统再任四年更具吸引力-这将被视为“不可预测的”。
特朗普总统及其政府在有关中国的推文和新闻声明中谈到了这一点。
共和党海外游说团体副主席兼首席执行官所罗门·岳（Solomon Yue）表示，毫无疑问，在特朗普政府执政期间，“脱钩将加速”。
随着中美之间的紧张局势恶化，其他中国公司也将越来越多地效仿。
但这正是特朗普总统所说的需要改变的：他的政府认为中国已经变得更富裕，而美国却变得更穷。

Several insiders at Chinese technology firms say have told me that a Joe Biden presidency would be more appealing than another four more years of President Trump - which would be seen as "unpredictable".
President Trump and his administration talk about it in tweets and in press statements in relation to China.
Make no mistake, under a Trump administration "decoupling will be accelerated", according to Solomon Yue, vice chairman and chief executive of the Republicans Overseas lobby group.
Increasingly other Chinese companies are likely to follow suit, as tensions between the US and China get worse.
But that's precisely what President Trump says needs to change: his administration argues that China has become richer while the US has become poorer.

刚刚宣布，由于航空公司无法缩减规模，盖特威克航空将失去600个工作岗位。

He said: "We would be ready to move, we would be ready to invest, ready to create jobs.

这些工作将主要在其商店进行，但90个职位也将在其支持中心失去。
现在，它在英国的367家商店的营业时间比大流行之前要少得多，该公司已要求员工减少营业时间。
该公司曾警告称，将在6月份裁员1000人，但在本周完成重组协议后，这一数字有所上升。
行业机构UK Hospitality表示，尽管锁定措施有所缓解，但仍有大约三分之一的饭店和酒吧仍未营业，因为人们仍对这种病毒的传播感到担忧。

The jobs will mainly go at its shops, but 90 roles will also be lost at its support centre.
It 367 UK stores are now open for significantly fewer hours than they were before the pandemic, and the firm has asked staff to reduce their hours.
The firm had warned it would cut 1,000 jobs back in June, but that number has risen after it finalised a restructuring deal this week.
Industry body UK Hospitality says around a third of restaurants and bars have still not reopened despite the easing of lockdown, as people remain nervous about the spread of the virus.

在新西兰证券交易所的股票交易所连续第四天遭受攻击之后，新西兰通信安全局已被要求提供帮助。
由于所谓的“分布式拒绝服务”（DDoS）攻击，该交易所未能按计划在周五开放。
该交易所的网站被网络攻击所淹没，迫使其停止交易。
股市运营商NZX表示，其网络已因源自海外的网络攻击而崩溃。
DDoS攻击旨在通过向网站充斥大量请求直至其崩溃来使网站瘫痪。

The exchange failed to open as planned on Friday due to so-called "distributed denial of service" (DDoS) attacks.
The exchange's website was overwhelmed by the cyber attacks, forcing it to halt trading.
The stock market operator NZX said its networks had crashed due to the cyber attacks, which originated overseas.
DDoS attacks are designed to knock a website offline by flooding it with huge amounts of requests until it crashes.
