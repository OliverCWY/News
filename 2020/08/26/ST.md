新加坡-新加坡注册公司Bellagraph Nova（BN）Group将寻求法律顾问，以调查涉及其一些营销和宣传材料的争议。
国阵集团是由新加坡商人卢家辉先生和纳尔逊罗先生创立的Dorr集团与中国珠宝商人沉文轩女士的Bellagraph集团合并而成的。
BN集团的宣传材料将Dorr集团描述为“资产超过40亿美元”。
BN集团的新闻稿在过去两个月中由PR Newswire发布。
BN Group当时表示，NETX是“诞生”的，这是其联合创始人去年12月与奥巴马先生举行的“历史性”闭门会议的结果。

SINGAPORE - Singapore-registered company Bellagraph Nova (BN) Group will be seeking legal counsel to investigate the controversy involving some of its marketing and publicity materials.
BN Group was formed following a merger between the Dorr Group founded by Singapore businessmen Mr Terence Loh and Mr Nelson Loh, and Chinese jewellery merchant Ms Evangeline Shen's Bellagraph Group.
Publicity material for BN Group describes the Dorr Group as having "over US$4 billion in assets".
The releases by the BN Group were distributed by PR Newswire in the past two months.
BN Group said then that NETX "was born" as a result of a "historic" closed-door meeting that its co-founders had with Mr Obama last December.

华盛顿（彭博社）-第一夫人梅拉尼娅·特朗普（Melania Trump）将在玫瑰园举行的共和党全国代表大会第二晚之夜成为头条新闻，此前国务卿迈克尔·庞培（Michael Pompeo）为纳税人资助的耶路撒冷访问期间的总统连任大获成功。
特朗普夫人计划在白宫玫瑰园现场直播讲话时结束周二的节目，白宫玫瑰园最近在她监督的项目中进行了装修。
庞培先生可能会预见到他的出现会引起轩然大波，他将其描绘成来自私人公民的信息。
保罗在准备好的讲话中称赞特朗普对结束战争“而不是发动战争”的承诺。贸易与经济其他支持特朗普贸易政策的发言人包括帮助在威斯康星州经营奶牛场的克里斯·彼得森先生和约翰·彼得森先生，威斯康星州金属制造商Schuette Metals的首席执行官。
特朗普先生吹捧他在进行刑事司法改革方面的成功，并谴责拜登先生制定了增加联邦量刑指南的立法。

WASHINGTON (BLOOMBERG) - First lady Melania Trump will headline the second night of the Republican National Convention from the Rose Garden after Secretary of State Michael Pompeo delivers a pitch for the President’s re-election taped during a taxpayer-financed visit to Jerusalem.
Mrs Trump is scheduled to close Tuesday’s programme with remarks live from the White House Rose Garden, which was recently renovated in a project she oversaw.
Perhaps anticipating the uproar that arose over his appearance, Mr Pompeo is portraying it as a message from a private citizen.
In his prepared remarks, Mr Paul praises Mr Trump’s commitment to end wars “rather than start one.”TRADE AND ECONOMYOther speakers backing Mr Trump’s trade policies will include Mr Cris Peterson, who helps run a dairy farm in Wisconsin, and Mr John Peterson, chief executive officer of Wisconsin-based metal fabricator Schuette Metals.
Mr Trump has touted his success in enacting criminal-justice reform and blamed Mr Biden for legislation that increased federal sentencing guidelines.

新加坡-从星期五（8月28日）开始，来中国的新加坡旅客必须在飞往该国的五天内进行Covid-19测试，以确保他们没有冠状病毒。
相反，旅客必须在出发前48小时和着陆后48小时进行Covid-19棉签测试。
当地的廉价航空公司酷酷航空（Scoot）周二不慎向客户发送了一封大规模电子邮件，称他们在前往中国之前必须参加Covid-19测试，该测试也因此受到关注。
相关故事中国新加坡向仍然测试为阳性的旅行者咨询。对于Covid-19测试，中国大使馆表示，在此阶段，它没有指定具体机构进行测试。
卫生部表示：“目前，出发前的Covid-19测试仅适用于在绿道安排下进行基本商务旅行和公务旅行的旅行者。”

SINGAPORE - From Friday (Aug 28), Singapore travellers to China will have to take a Covid-19 test within five days before their flight to the country, to ensure they are free of the coronavirus.
Instead, travellers must take a Covid-19 swab test 48 hours before departure and after they land.
The test also came under the spotlight after local budget carrier Scoot accidentally sent a mass e-mail to customers on Tuesday saying that they must take a Covid-19 test before travelling to China.

Late on Monday, police wearing military-type gear fired tear gas at hundreds of protesters who snubbed a citywide curfew to demonstrate over Blake's shooting.
The protesters, chanting "No justice, no peace" and "Say his name - Jacob Blake," shot fireworks and lobbed water bottles at the police.
"They are relieved that he is in stable condition," Crump told ABC's Good Morning America show.

拉各斯（法新社）–联合国世界卫生组织（WHO）周二（8月25日）宣布，非洲现在没有引起小儿麻痹症的病毒，这是长达数十年的消灭全世界臭名昭著的疾病的里程碑。
非洲的最后一例脊髓灰质炎病例是在2016年在尼日利亚发现的，该地区的疫苗接种工作受到Boko Haram圣战分子的阻碍。

“只有在政府，社区，全球消灭小儿麻痹症的伙伴和慈善家的领导和承诺下，这项历史性成就才有可能实现，” Moeti说。

LAGOS (AFP) – The UN’s World Health Organisation (WHO) on Tuesday (Aug 25) declared that Africa was now free of the virus that causes polio, a landmark in a decades-long campaign to eradicate the notorious disease around the world.
The last case of polio in Africa was detected in 2016 in Nigeria, where vaccination efforts had been hampered by Boko Haram jihadists.

大多数人在Covid-19感染后会产生强大的免疫反应，但由于目前未知的原因，香港男子未能对3月下旬的首次感染产生抗体反应。
在全球范围内，有超过2300万例病例，在香港病例之前，只有零星的报道称人们被Covid-19再次感染。
有趣的是，这位香港男子第二次没有任何症状，而在他第一次感染期间，症状却很轻微。
他说：“该病毒含有能够抑制我们的免疫反应的遗传成分，而疫苗旨在刺激这些反应。”
香港大学网站微生物学系临床助理教授Siddharth Sridhar在香港大学网站上转载的最新Facebook帖子中说，对于大多数人来说，Covid-19感染会产生强大的免疫反应。

Most people develop a robust immune response after a Covid-19 infection, but for reasons that are currently unknown, the man in Hong Kong had failed to mount an antibody response to the first infection in late March.
Globally, there are more than 23 million cases, and before the Hong Kong case, there have been only some anecdotal reports of people being reinfected with Covid-19.
Interestingly, the Hong Kong man had no symptoms the second time around, while during his first infection, the symptoms were mild.
"The virus contains genetic elements that are able to suppress our immune response, whereas vaccines are designed to stimulate these responses," he said.
In a recent Facebook post reproduced on the HKU website, clinical assistant professor Siddharth Sridhar from HKU's department of microbiology said that for most individuals, a Covid-19 infection would confer a robust immune response.

消息人士说，俱乐部从梅西的律师那里得到了一张burofax，宣称这位在巴萨度过了整个职业生涯的球员希望离开。
消息来源补充说，俱乐部随后向梅西送了一张burofax，说他们希望他留下来并在巴萨完成他的职业生涯。
第二名消息人士补充说：“俱乐部认为该合同在2021年6月30日之前具有完全约束力。”
在普约尔的支持下，前巴萨队长卡洛斯·普约尔在推特上写道：“尊敬和钦佩，利奥，支持梅西离开俱乐部的愿望。
如果他们辞职，梅西可能会留在巴萨。”他发推文说。

The source said the club received a burofax from Messi's lawyers declaring that the player, who has spent his entire career at Barca, wished to leave.
The club subsequently sent Messi a burofax, stating they wanted him to stay and finish his career at Barca, added the source.
"The club considers that the contract is fully binding until June 30, 2021," added the second source.
BACKED BY PUYOLFormer Barca captain Carles Puyol backed Messi's wish to leave the club by writing on Twitter: "Respect and admiration, Leo.
If they quit there might be some hope that Messi stays at Barca," he tweeted.
