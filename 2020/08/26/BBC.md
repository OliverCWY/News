As a result of the partial or complete severing of his spinal cord, Mr Blake is paralysed, with doctors unsure if he will recover the use of his legs.
Lawyers for Mr Blake said he had been trying to "de-escalate a domestic incident".
Within hours of Mr Blake's shooting, hundreds of people had marched on Kenosha's police headquarters.

大约24家公司表示，他们没有任何计划将工人遣返办公室。

英国广播公司对从银行到零售商的50个大型雇主进行了询问，以了解他们何时期望要求雇员返回办公室。
几家公司已经宣布，他们没有计划在深秋之前返回办公室，而Facebook表示，它不计划在2021年7月之前遣散员工。
“办公室工作人员对我们至关重要。

Some 24 firms said that they did not have any plans in place to return workers to the office.
It comes as many employees return to work from the summer holidays with the reality of a prolonged period of home working becoming increasingly likely.
The BBC questioned 50 big employers ranging from banks to retailers to get a sense of when they expected to ask employees to return to the office.
A few firms have already announced they have no plans to return to the office until late autumn, and Facebook has said it does not plan a return of employees until July 2021.
"Office workers are absolutely critical to us.

全世界已经消灭了三分之二的野生脊髓灰质炎病毒。
这是非洲区域认证委员会在宣布非洲大陆没有小儿麻痹症之前设定的条件之一。
脊髓灰质炎可以很容易地输入到一个没有脊髓灰质炎的国家，并从那里可以在免疫不足的人群中迅速传播。
如果他们因未能接种疫苗而降低防御能力，那么野生脊髓灰质炎可能会再次迅速蔓延。

Two out of three strains of wild polio virus have been eradicated worldwide.
This was one of the conditions that the Africa Regional Certification Commission set before declaring the continent free from wild polio.
Polio can be easily imported into a country that is polio free and from there it can spread rapidly among under-immunised populations.
If they let down their defence by failing to vaccinate, then wild polio could once again begin to spread quickly.

克里姆林宫说，俄罗斯医生还指出胆碱酯酶水平降低并服用了阿托品，但没有发现中毒的迹象。
他自己的医生建议他可能已经接触了“某种有毒物质”，纳瓦尼先生说他认为自己可能已经中毒了。

The Kremlin says Russian doctors also noted lowered cholinesterase levels and administered atropine, but found no evidence of poisoning.
His own doctor suggested he might have been exposed to "some toxic agent" and Mr Navalny said he thought he might have been poisoned.

美国航空公司表示，将在大流行期间扩大对航空公司的政府工资支持计划，将在10月裁员19,000人。
这家全球最大的航空公司表示，除自愿离职和休假外，裁员将使其员工人数比3月份减少30％。
其他航空公司警告说，在航空旅行不景气的情况下，将有类似的大幅削减。
在美国，政府提供250亿美元（190亿英镑）的救助条款禁止航空公司在9月30日之前大量裁员。
另有11,000人将在10月自愿请假。

Image copyright ReutersAmerican Airlines has said it will cut 19,000 jobs in October when a government wage support scheme extended to airlines during the pandemic comes to an end.
The world's biggest airline said the cuts, on top of voluntary departures and leave, would leave its workforce 30% smaller than it was in March.
Other carriers have warned of similarly large cuts amid a slump in air travel.
In the US, the terms of a $25bn (£19bn) government bailout barred airlines from making significant job cuts before 30 September.
Another 11,000 will be on voluntary leave in October.

维珍航空表示，该协议使它能够“重建其资产负债表”并“欢迎乘客返回”。
这笔12亿英镑的救助交易涉及4亿英镑的新现金，其中一半来自其主要股东理查德·布兰森爵士的维珍集团。
拥有维珍航空49％股份的美国航空公司达美航空表示，“对该计划将使维珍航空确保其未来感到乐观”，并表示仍“坚定地支持”该公司。

Virgin Atlantic said the agreement puts it in a position to "rebuild its balance sheet" and "welcome passengers back".
The £1.2bn rescue deal involves £400m in new cash, half of which will come from its main shareholder, Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group.
Delta, the US-based airline which owns 49% of Virgin Atlantic, said it is "optimistic that this plan will allow Virgin Atlantic to secure its future", and said it remains "firmly supportive" of the company.
Last month, Virgin Atlantic faced enforcement action over its delays in processing refunds for flights cancelled during the pandemic.

全球快餐业巨头肯德基表示，鉴于冠状病毒大流行，鉴于目前的卫生建议，该公司将停止其“手指舔好”的口号。
肯德基说，它已经改变了包装，用了模糊的短语，但是肯德基说，在适当的时候，这个短语会重新出现。
肯德基分店在3月暂时关闭，但现在大多数都已重新营业。
3月份，广告标准局收到163起有关肯德基电视广告的投诉，该广告的特点是人们舔手指。
由哈兰·桑德斯（Harland Saunders）于1930年代创立的肯德基（KFC）于1950年代开设了第一家专营店，此后一直使用Finger Lickin'Good口号。

It has altered its packaging with the phrase obscured but KFC said the phrase would return when the time was right.
KFC outlets closed temporarily in March, but most have now reopened.
In March, the Advertising Standards Authority received 163 complaints about a KFC TV advert which featured people licking their fingers.
KFC, which was founded in the 1930s by Harland Saunders, opened its first franchise in the 1950s and has used the Finger Lickin' Good slogan since then.
