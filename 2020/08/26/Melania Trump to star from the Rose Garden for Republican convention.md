WASHINGTON (BLOOMBERG) - First lady Melania Trump will headline the second night of the Republican National Convention from the Rose Garden after Secretary of State Michael Pompeo delivers a pitch for the President’s re-election taped during a taxpayer-financed visit to Jerusalem.

In an appearance critics say is politicising US diplomacy, Mr Pompeo will praise Mr Trump for leading “bold initiatives in nearly every corner of the world” to “keep us safe and our freedoms intact,” according to excerpts released in advance by President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign.

The President will make several appearances from the White House as he did on Monday (Aug 24), and two of his children, Mr Eric Trump and Ms Tiffany Trump, will be among speakers saluting the President’s handling of issues including trade and immigration.

With “land of opportunity” as the theme, the convention will spotlight an array of Trump supporters – from a Maine lobsterman to an anti-abortion activist and from the granddaughter of evangelist Billy Graham to the Democratic mayor of Eveleth, Minnesota.

The speakers – including Mr Jason Joyce, the lobster fisherman who will say he didn’t support Mr Trump in 2016 out of skepticism he was a true conservative – plan to say the president kept his campaign promises, strengthened the Supreme Court with his two appointments and put in place policies that have benefited blue-collar workers and farmers, according to excerpts released by the campaign.

Despite promises of an upbeat convention, Monday night’s opening session was dominated by dark images of “radical socialists” taking over the country if Democrat Joe Biden wins the November election and glowing tributes to Mr Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 177,000 Americans.

Mrs Trump is scheduled to close Tuesday’s programme with remarks live from the White House Rose Garden, which was recently renovated in a project she oversaw. The President and a small audience are expected to be there as well.

The Slovenian-born first lady has concentrated on a few favourite issues including her “Be Best” campaign against online bullying among youths, a contrast with her husband’s sharp-edged Twitter attacks. She will also talk about being a mother and why her husband should have another four years in office, her chief of staff, Ms Stephanie Grisham, told reporters on Tuesday.

“It’s very uplifting, it’s very positive, it reflects on her time as first lady, her favourite moments,” Ms Grisham said.

Mrs Trump will seek to avoid the controversy she generated from her speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland because of suggestions that portions were lifted from Mrs Michelle Obama’s address to the Democratic convention in 2008.

POMPEO’S TRIP

Mr Pompeo, who’s seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2024, recorded his remarks in Jerusalem looking out at the Old City during an official trip to the Middle East.

It appears to violate State Department guidance that prohibits participation in political conventions and politicking while on official travel. It’s also a departure from past secretaries who steered clear of conventions to avoid partisan politics.

Perhaps anticipating the uproar that arose over his appearance, Mr Pompeo is portraying it as a message from a private citizen. He said in a tweet that he will be “sharing with you how my family is more SAFE and more SECURE because of President Trump.”

Representative Joaquin Castro, the Texas Democrat who is vice chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, wrote Mr Pompeo’s deputy on Tuesday demanding documents and a briefing detailing the legal justification for what he called part of “a pattern of politicisation of U.S. foreign policy.”

KUDLOW’S PRAISE

White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow will praise Mr Trump’s support for economic relief during the pandemic, according to an advance excerpt, and say that there is “nobody better to lead us back to the top” than President Trump.

Also scheduled to speak on Tuesday are Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds and Nicholas Sandmann. He won settlements from several media outlets for portraying him as provoking a confrontation with a Native American protester while wearing a “Make America Great Again” cap during a high school trip to Washington last year.

Mr Paul’s libertarian background may appeal to a section of the Republican Party base that’s especially concerned about limiting government intervention. Although he’s a Trump supporter – and sometimes a golf partner – he’s differed with the President on issues including federal spending and the debt, federal agents rounding up protesters in Portland, Oregon, and military action abroad.

In his prepared remarks, Mr Paul praises Mr Trump’s commitment to end wars “rather than start one.”

TRADE AND ECONOMY

Other speakers backing Mr Trump’s trade policies will include Mr Cris Peterson, who helps run a dairy farm in Wisconsin, and Mr John Peterson, chief executive officer of Wisconsin-based metal fabricator Schuette Metals.

As with Monday night’s programme, Republicans will spotlight diversity with appearances by Blacks and Latinos who support Mr Trump, including Ms Jeanette Nunez, Florida’s first Latina lieutenant governor, and Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, the first Black man elected to a statewide office there, according to the Trump campaign.

Mr Jon Ponder, founder and chief executive officer of Hope for Prisoners Inc, a nonprofit designed to help individuals re-enter society, is scheduled to speak along with Mr Richard Beasley, the former FBI agent who arrested Mr Ponder for bank robbery, the campaign said. Mr Trump has touted his success in enacting criminal-justice reform and blamed Mr Biden for legislation that increased federal sentencing guidelines.
