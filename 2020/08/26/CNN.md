华盛顿（CNN）众议院民主党人已开始对国务卿迈克·庞培（Mike Pompeo）为解决共和党全国代表大会所做的有争议的决定进行调查。
它激怒了现任和过去的国务院官员。
消息人士称，演讲是通过庞培的私人律师，国务院和白宫律师以及RNC律师进行的。
美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）已联系国务院，对卡斯特罗（Castro）的调查发表评论。
庞培在共和党大会上的讲话并不是他担任美国最高外交官时第一次涉足国内政治领域。

Washington (CNN) A House Democrat has opened an investigation into Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's controversial decision to address the Republican National Convention.
It has rankled current and past State Department officials.
The source said the speech was cleared through Pompeo's personal lawyers, State Department and White House lawyers, and RNC lawyers.
CNN has reached out to the State Department for comment on Castro's investigation.
Pompeo's speech to the GOP convention is not the first time he has waded into the domestic political fray while serving as the top US diplomat.

（CNN）阿根廷足球明星莱昂内尔·梅西（Lionel Messi）已向巴塞罗那发出一封信，告知俱乐部他想离开球队。
加泰罗尼亚队在冠军联赛四分之一决赛中拜仁慕尼黑惨遭8-2败北之后，俱乐部主席Josep Maria Bartomeu告诉巴萨电视台：“梅西多次表示，他想结束在巴萨的职业生涯。
2017年7月，巴塞罗那和梅西宣布续签合同，这将使梅西在车队任职至2021年6月30日，据报道每周价值565,000欧元（645,000美元）。
六届金球奖得主于2004年在巴塞罗那联赛中首次亮相。

(CNN) Argentine football star Lionel Messi has sent a letter to Barcelona informing the club that he wants to leave the team, a source close to the footballer confirmed to CNN.
Following the Catalan side's humiliating 8-2 defeat by Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarterfinals, club president Josep Maria Bartomeu told Barca TV: "Messi has said many times that he wants to finish career at Barca.
In July 2017, Barcelona and Messi announced a contract extension that would keep Messi with the team until June 30, 2021 and is reportedly worth €565,000 ($645,000) a week.
The six-time Ballon d'Or winner made his league debut for Barcelona in 2004.
The Argentine has helped Barcelona win 10 league titles in his time at the club, as well as the Champions League four times, and he is considered one of the greatest footballers of all time.

Naval vessels from both countries made a show of force in the contested region of the Eastern Mediterranean on Tuesday as a race for gas and oil reserves adds a new point of friction to old disputes.
While the NATO allies have been engaging in gunboat diplomacy that has pulled more countries into the dispute, Germany has been looking to de-escalate the tensions that threaten to spill over regionally.
"The conversation windows between Greece and Turkey must now be opened further -- and not closed.
The Oruc Reis survey vessel is accompanied by naval ships and the Turkish defense ministry announced maritime exercises in the area.

## 随着劳拉飓风驶向墨西哥湾沿岸，可能会“迅速加剧”

### 'Rapid intensification' is likely as Hurricane Laura tracks toward Gulf Coast

迈克尔飓风是2018年的飓风，是墨西哥湾最后一次迅速加剧的重大飓风。
快速集约化是罕见的，因为所有这些碎片都必须就位，所以快速集约化是罕见的，每年仅一两次大西洋风暴就经历了这样的加速。
也就是说，大多数达到最高类别（3、4和5）的风暴都会通过快速集约化达到这些强度。
但是众所周知，预测快速集约化是困难的，因为预测模型无法掌握提供给它的所有不同变量，并且因为存在变量时并不总是会发生快速集约化。
这使科学家们相信，由于气候变化使海洋变暖，风暴更有可能经历“快速集约化”。

Hurricane Michael, in 2018, was the last major hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico to rapidly intensify.
Rapid intensification is rareBecause all those pieces must be in place, rapid intensification is rare, with just one or two Atlantic storms per year undergoing such an acceleration.
That said, most storms that reach the highest categories -- 3, 4 and 5 -- reach these intensities through rapid intensification.
But it's notoriously hard to predict rapid intensification because forecast models fail to pick up on all the different variables that feed into it -- and because rapid intensification doesn't always happen when the variables are present.
This has led scientists to believe that storms are more likely to undergo "rapid intensification" as a result of climate change warming the oceans.

这位心爱的演员曾在1962年的第一部邦德电影《无博士》中饰演007特工，多年来一直不在好莱坞关注，但这并不意味着他仍然不是大明星。
社交媒体庆祝了他的里程碑生日，《卫报》的彼得·布拉德肖（Peter Bradshaw）在标题为“ 90岁的塞恩·康纳利（Sean Connery：危险的诱人男性气概）”的文章中庆祝了演员和他的职业生涯。

The first James Bond turned 90 on Tuesday, as difficult as that is to believe.
It's true: Connery was born August 25, 1930, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
The beloved actor, who starred as Agent 007 in the first Bond film "Dr. No" in 1962, hasn't been on the Hollywood radar for years, but that doesn't mean he's not still a big star.
Social media celebrated his milestone birthday and The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw celebrated the actor and his career in a piece headlined "Sean Connery at 90: a dangerously seductive icon of masculinity."

In June, cruise giant Carnival Corporation announced plans to remove at least six cruise ships from its fleet.
Managing Director Peter Deer told CNN he sees the decision as a mark of confidence in the cruise industry.

建议零售和服务业根据CDC准则实施的程序包括强制戴口罩，社交疏远和限制一次允许的客户数量。
但是疾病预防控制中心警告说，采用这些安全措施可能会威胁或殴打工人，描述的暴力行为包括大喊大叫，骂人，打耳光和cho人。

New York (CNN Business) When in doubt, don't argue with anti-maskers.
That's the recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to retail and service employees.
This week, the health agency issued new guidance to limit workplace violence that could be aimed at workers when enforcing their companies' Covid-19 safety procedures.
The procedures that retail and service businesses have been advised to implement under CDC guidelines include enforcing mask wearing, social distancing and limiting the number of customers allowed in a business at one time.
But the CDC warns that workers could be threatened or assaulted for employing these safety measures, describing violence ranging from yelling and swearing to slapping and choking the employees.

因此，您可能会认为像我这样的电影爱好者会因与Covid-19相关的几个月的闲置而重新开放电影院的前景满月。
两年前，林肯广场电影院（Lincoln Plaza Cinemas）也向北面几个街区的电影爱好者提供了多种多样且广受好评的票价，但它们关门了。
也许，除了好奇心之外，对于Covid时代的电影院体验将如何发挥作用，无非如此。

Movies are movies.
The thing about moviegoers like Binx — and me — is that social distancing in a movie theater isn't a problem: It's the whole point.
So, you'd think movie lovers like me would be over the moon over the prospect of movie theaters reopening after months of Covid-19-related inactivity.
Two years before, the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, which likewise offered diverse and critically acclaimed fare to movie lovers a few blocks north, shut its doors for good.
Maybe, if for no other reason than curiosity as to how a Covid-era movie theater experience will work.

And the research team realized that in 2019, they were "ready to know who killed this ground sloth," Salas-Gismondi said.
The researchers haven't ruled out the possibility that the bite marks occurred shortly after death as the Purussaurus dismembered the sloth's carcass.
The birds didn't have teeth and the bite marks from marsupial teeth don't match those on the bone.

他讲述了自己在职业生涯中已经习惯于在社交媒体上受到的虐待。
美国人泰勒·汤森（Taylor Townsend）表示，这种情况全都发生在网球运动员身上。不同之处在于每位运动员受到虐待的性质。
对运动员的虐待已经引起了有关社交媒体公司是否在做足够的努力来消除这种虐待的质疑。
这是通过利用情报软件通过其他社交媒体平台以及在社交媒体上手动搜索姓名来定位个人来实现的。
据Playsight称，网球诚信单位（TIU）将所有被调查的帐户报告给相关的社交媒体公司。

He recounts the sort of abuse he's become accustomed to receiving on social media over the course of his playing career.
American Taylor Townsend says it happens to tennis players across the board; what differs is the nature of the abuse each athlete receives.
The abuse of athletes has raised questions about whether social media companies are doing enough to stamp out this abuse.
This is achieved by utilizing intelligence software to locate individuals via other social media platforms, as well as by manual name searches on social media.
According to Playsight, the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU) reported all the accounts that were investigated to the relevant social media companies.

More than two-thirds (68%) of large company CEOs plan to downsize their office space, according to a survey released Tuesday by KPMG.
And that in turn raises questions about the value of expensive office space, especially in high-priced cities like New York and San Francisco.
By shrinking their office footprint, those real estate costs can go down, in some cases dramatically.

每个地点都是独特的，但斯坦因茨注意到了一个共同的主题-人类正在改变地球。
在2018年《纽约时报》（New York Times）杂志派遣他到各个大洲记录气候变化之后，斯坦梅茨决定整理一本书，收集他整个职业生涯的图像。
“人类星球”记载了我们对环境的影响以及为保护环境而提出的解决方案。

Each location was unique, but the Steinmetz noticed a common theme -- humans were changing the planet.
After a 2018 New York Times Magazine assignment that sent him to every continent to document climate change, Steinmetz decided to put together a book, collecting images spanning his whole career.
"Human Planet" chronicles our impact on the environment and the solutions we have come up with to try to save it.

## 画飞机：为什么每一层都很重要

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-当通过吸引人的飞机制服寻求公众的关注时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常是白色，但并不总是白色（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板可以应用最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，并购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
