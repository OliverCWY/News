SINGAPORE - Former US ambassador to Singapore Kirk Wagar said he has resigned from his independent director position in Axington, which is linked to Bellagraph Nova (BN) Group, the Singapore-registered company that had admitted to doctoring photographs of former United States President Barack Obama.

He told The Straits Times on Tuesday (Aug 25): “Due to the recent revelations, I have resigned that position and asked for Axington to advise Singapore Exchange and any other relevant parties of that fact.”
