(CNN) Even amid a pandemic, life expectancy among White people in the United States far exceeds what Black people have experienced every year, according to new research.

The research , published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday, used national life expectancy data and demographic models to estimate how many White deaths from Covid-19 would be needed for the White death rate in 2020 to reach the levels of the year with the lowest Black death rate ever recorded, which was in 2014.

The paper included data on Covid-19 deaths as of July 29, Elizabeth Wrigley-Field of the University of Minnesota Department of Sociology, who conducted this research, told CNN.

"In 2014, the year of the lowest Black mortality ever recorded, age-adjusted Black mortality was about 1,061 per 100,000. In 2017 (the most recent year with final death estimates), U.S. white age-adjusted mortality was 899 deaths per 100,000," Wrigley-Field wrote in an email.

"White Covid-19 age-adjusted mortality is currently about 28 deaths per 100,000," she wrote. "Thus, US white deaths including Covid are still well below the best that Black mortality has ever been."
