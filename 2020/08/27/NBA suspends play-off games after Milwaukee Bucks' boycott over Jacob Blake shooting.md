Balls and towels were removed from the Bucks' bench area

The NBA postponed Wednesday's three play-off games after the Milwaukee Bucks boycotted their fixture in protest at the shooting of Jacob Blake.

Blake, a black man, was shot several times in the back by police on Sunday.

The incident took place in Kenosha, Wisconsin, 40 miles from Milwaukee.

Prior to the Bucks' scheduled game with the Orlando Magic, coach Mike Budenholzer said: "Myself, my players and our organisation are very disturbed by what happened in Kenosha."

He added: "It is a great challenge to have an appreciation and a desire to want change, to want something different and better in Kenosha, Milwaukee and Wisconsin, and then to go out and play a game."

Magic players and match officials were on court, preparing for the game, but the Bucks' players did not appear from their locker room.

The Houston Rockets' game against the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Los Angeles Lakers' match-up with the Portland Trail Blazers were also postponed.

The Lakers' LeBron James tweeted: "We demand change. Sick of it."
