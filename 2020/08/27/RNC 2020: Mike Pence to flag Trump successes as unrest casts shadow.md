The appalling shooting of Jacob Blake in Wisconsin has stirred a pot that was in no need of further agitation. As I sit and write this, there has been zero discussion so far at the Republican convention of whether there is a problem of systemic racism in the police. No one has raised the question of why it is that excessive force disproportionately often seems to involve white police officers and black victims. The president has said nothing about Blake being shot in the back seven times. Nor the vice-president.

In fairness to the first lady, Melania Trump, she did discuss questions of racial justice in a calm and measured way last night. And maybe when Mike Pence speaks this evening, and the president winds up the convention tomorrow, some of these wider issues will be addressed. But at the moment everything is seen through the prism of the violence and disorder that has followed, as if the two can be entirely decoupled.

The caricature that Republicans draw of Democrats is that they are only interested in defunding and demonising the police and making excuses for the rioters. And the reverse is that Republicans don’t care what happens to black people they just want to shout "law and order" and warn that a Democrat president will lead to mob rule.

Isn’t there the political space for the leaders of this country to say that shooting someone seven times in the back is wrong; and that setting light to people’s cars and businesses is intolerable too.
