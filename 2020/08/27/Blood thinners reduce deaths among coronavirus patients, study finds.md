(CNN) Blood thinners appear to reduce the risk of death by up to 50% among seriously ill, hospitalized coronavirus patients, researchers reported Wednesday.

And patients given anticoagulants also were 30% less likely to need a ventilator to help them breathe, a team at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York reported.

Their study of more than 4,300 patients also those who died often had evidence of blood clots throughout their bodies, even though many of them had no symptoms of the problem. It's more evidence of the serious, systemwide blood clotting that coronavirus infections can cause, but the findings offer hope of countering the effect.

"Compared to no anticoagulation, both prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation was associated with decreased mortality and intubation," the team wrote in their report, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

It was not a randomized controlled study, the gold standard for medical research. The study's leader, Dr. Valentin Fuster, says that's next. "An international randomized trial just started with 15 institutions," Fuster told CNN. "We are comparing three types of anticoagulants that work."
