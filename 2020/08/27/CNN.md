（CNN）当警察认为嫌疑犯可能伤害或杀死他们时，通常会训练他们开枪射击尽可能多的枪械，以将嫌疑犯打倒。
执法部门长期以来一直在质疑警察为何向嫌疑犯开枪。
他说，如果军官使用致命武力，他们通常会接受训练，以不停发火力并快速连续射击-休息一下以评估他们正在射击的嫌疑犯可能给那个嫌疑犯造成伤害他们或他人的时间。 。
他说，这可能会使军官之间产生混乱：他们可能将另一名军官的镜头误认为是向他们开枪的嫌疑人，这可能导致他们继续不必要地射击。
在警官不知道嫌疑人是否武装的情况下，警官缺乏信心可能导致他们致命地射击未武装的人。

(CNN) When police believe a suspect could harm or kill them, they're usually trained to fire as many gunshots as it takes to bring that suspect down.
Law enforcement departments have long fielded questions about why officers fired as many shots as they did at a suspect.
If officers are using deadly force, they're usually trained to not pause their fire and to shoot in quick succession -- taking a break to assess the suspect they're shooting at could give that suspect time to harm them or others, he said.
This can create confusion among the officers, though, he said: They may mistake another officer's shots for the suspect firing shots at them, which could cause them to continue to shoot needlessly.
In circumstances where officers don't know whether a suspect is armed, an officer's lack of confidence could cause them to fatally shoot an unarmed person.

现在，特朗普总统的前私人律师兼固定人迈克尔·科恩（Michael Cohen）告诉美国有线电视新闻网（CNN），他进行干预以确保揭示Falwells的照片并未在2015年公开发布。
“这些是夫妻之间的私人照片，”科恩告诉美国有线电视新闻网。
Jerry Falwell Jr.和Becki Falwell在2019年3月5日在拉斯维加斯举行的关于阿片类药物危机的市政厅会议上发表讲话。
在格兰达（Granda）的故事公开之前不久发表的一份声明中，小法尔威尔（Falwell Jr.）承认这一恋情，但表示他“没有参与”。
迈克尔科恩（Michael Cohen）的新消息为这个故事提供了最新信息。迈克尔·科恩（Michael Cohen）告诉美国有线电视新闻网（CNN），他在较早的声明中误认了。

Now, Michael Cohen, President Trump's former personal attorney and fixer, tells CNN that he intervened to make sure revealing photos of the Falwells were not released publicly in 2015.
"These were personal photos between a husband and wife," Cohen told CNN.
Jerry Falwell Jr. and Becki Falwell speak during a town hall meeting on the opioid crisis on March 5, 2019, in Las Vegas.
In a statement released shortly before Granda's story became public, Falwell Jr. acknowledged the affair but said that he was "not involved."
This story has been updated with new information from Michael Cohen, who told CNN he misspoke in an earlier statement.

克林顿补充说：“我们必须进行大规模的法律行动，我知道拜登竞选活动正在为此努力。

Added Clinton: "We've got to have a massive legal operation, I know the Biden campaign is working on that.
What Clinton envisions is an election night that could well extend into an election week or even -- gulp\!
-- an election month, because of an expected surge in mail-in balloting due to concerns about the coronavirus.
(There is zero evidence of the sort of widespread voter fraud in mail-in balloting that Trump is alleging.)

（CNN）当局说，NBA传奇人物Kareem Abdul-Jabbar的儿子Adam Abdul-Jabbar因涉嫌在垃圾桶上的争执而刺伤他的邻居两个月后被指控犯有重罪。
奥兰治县地方检察官办公室周二称，现年28岁的阿卜杜勒-贾巴尔（Abdul-Jabbar）被指控在6月9日在圣克莱门特（San Clemente）的一次辩论中，用一把大猎刀反复刺伤他60岁的邻居，并弄伤了他的头骨。
辩护开始于邻居阿卜杜勒-贾巴尔（Abdul-Jabbar）关于不带进他室友的垃圾桶的争论，地方检察官办公室说，并补充说，在争执升级后发生了刺伤事件。
奥兰治县地方检察官托德·斯皮策（Todd Spitzer）在一份声明中说：“邻居之间的争端绝不应该升级为暴力，更不用说这次袭击的残酷性质了。”
“橙县不会容忍任何形式的暴力行为，那些选择对他人施加暴力的人将受到橙县检察官办公室的最大程度法律起诉。”

(CNN) Adam Abdul-Jabbar, son of NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, has been charged with multiple felonies two months after allegedly stabbing his neighbor after an argument over trash cans, authorities said.
Abdul-Jabbar, 28, is accused of stabbing his 60-year-old neighbor repeatedly with a large hunting knife and fracturing his skull during an argument in San Clemente on June 9, the Orange County District Attorney's Office said on Tuesday.
The argument began when the neighbor confronted Abdul-Jabbar about not taking in his elderly roommate's trash cans, the district attorney's office said, adding that the stabbing occurred after the argument escalated.
"A dispute between neighbors should never escalate to violence, much less the ruthless nature of this attack," Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said in a statement.
"Violence of any kind will not be tolerated in Orange County and those who choose to inflict violence on others will be prosecuted by the Orange County District Attorney's Office to the fullest extent of the law."

建议零售和服务业根据CDC指南实施的程序包括强制戴口罩，社交疏远和限制一次允许的企业数量。
但是疾病预防控制中心警告说，采用这些安全措施可能会威胁或殴打工人，其中描述的暴力行为包括大喊大叫，骂人，打耳光和and人。

New York (CNN Business) When in doubt, don't argue with anti-maskers.
That's the recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to retail and service employees.
This week, the health agency issued new guidance to limit workplace violence that could be aimed at workers when enforcing their companies' Covid-19 safety procedures.
The procedures that retail and service businesses have been advised to implement under CDC guidelines include enforcing mask wearing, social distancing and limiting the number of customers allowed in a business at one time.
But the CDC warns that workers could be threatened or assaulted for employing these safety measures, describing violence ranging from yelling and swearing to slapping and choking the employees.

明尼苏达大学社会学系的伊丽莎白·瑞格利-菲尔德（Elizabeth Wrigley-Field）表示，该论文包括截至7月29日Covid-19死亡的数据。
“ 2014年是有记录以来黑人死亡率最低的一年，按年龄调整的黑人死亡率约为每10万人中1,061人。
在2017年（最新的最终死亡估计数）中，美国白人年龄调整后的死亡率为每100,000人899例死亡，” Wrigley-Field在一封电子邮件中写道。
她写道：“按年龄调整后的白人Covid-19死亡率目前约为每10万人中28例死亡。”
“因此，包括科维德在内的美国白人死亡人数仍远低于黑人死亡人数以来的最高水平。”

The paper included data on Covid-19 deaths as of July 29, Elizabeth Wrigley-Field of the University of Minnesota Department of Sociology, who conducted this research, told CNN.
"In 2014, the year of the lowest Black mortality ever recorded, age-adjusted Black mortality was about 1,061 per 100,000.
In 2017 (the most recent year with final death estimates), U.S. white age-adjusted mortality was 899 deaths per 100,000," Wrigley-Field wrote in an email.
"White Covid-19 age-adjusted mortality is currently about 28 deaths per 100,000," she wrote.
"Thus, US white deaths including Covid are still well below the best that Black mortality has ever been."

就像地狱一样。”莎拉告诉美国有线电视新闻网。
IOM估计，在2014年至2018年之间，有35,000多名冈比亚人通过“不正当手段”到达了欧洲。
萨拉在被拘留期间会见了冈比亚同胞，他建议他们成立非营利组织“青年打击非正规移民”（YAIM），以警告其他人注意非正规移民的风险。
萨拉回到冈比亚几周后说，他会见了一些在拘留所签约的伊斯兰革命运动党成员。
社区意识通过YAIM，返回者在冈比亚开展了针对非正规移民的运动，警告其他人前往欧洲的危险。

It was like hell," Sallah told CNN.
Between 2014 and 2018, the IOM estimates more than 35,000 Gambians reached Europe through "irregular means."
While in detention, Sallah met a fellow Gambian who suggested they set up the non-profit organization Youth Against Irregular Migration (YAIM) to warn others back home about the risks of irregular migration.
Weeks after returning to The Gambia, Sallah said he met with some members of YAIM who signed up in the detention center.
Community awarenessThrough YAIM, the returnees began campaigns around irregular migration in The Gambia, warning others about the perils of journeying to Europe.

继成年的霸王龙之后，下一个咬咬力最强的是现代盐水鳄鳄鳄，咬咬力为1.6吨。
研究团队意识到，在2019年，他们“已经准备好知道谁杀死了这只树懒”，萨拉斯·吉斯蒙迪说。
鸟类没有牙齿，有袋动物牙齿的咬痕与骨头上的牙齿不符。
随着它们的生长，它们的咬合力会发生变化，这意味着少年和成年动物有捕获哺乳动物和海龟的能力。
凭借巨大的咬合力，Purssaurus在选择下一餐时不受大小的限制。

After the adult Purussaurus, the next strongest bite comes from the modern saltwater crocodile, Crocodylus porosus, which has a bite force of 1.6 tons.
And the research team realized that in 2019, they were "ready to know who killed this ground sloth," Salas-Gismondi said.
The birds didn't have teeth and the bite marks from marsupial teeth don't match those on the bone.
As they grow, their bite force changes, meaning that juveniles and adults have the ability to capture mammals and turtles.
With its massive bite force, Purussaurus wasn't limited by size when choosing its next meal.

The Liaoning Finance and Natural Resources departments issued a statement in July that circulated widely on Chinese social media this week, listing "usage fees" for the uninhabited islands.
Though the islands, like most land and resources in China, are owned by the government, they can be leased out to individuals.

坎迪的汽车尚未在美国环境保护署的fueleconomy.gov网站上列出，因此该范围可能无法与其他电动汽车的官方EPA范围相提并论。
Kandi K27之所以能够达到这一目标，至少部分是因为它对18千瓦时小型电池组的要求不高。
对于寻找更像“真正的汽车”之类的客户，Kandi提供了K23。
“我们希望为正在思考的人们提供一个新的类别，'嘿，我想要一辆电动汽车，我想要对环境有益，但我也想节省金钱。'”
（另一辆Kandi汽车，即Coco，一种类似于戴姆勒的Smart汽车的电动汽车，几年前由一家外部公司在美国出售。）

Kandi's cars are not yet listed on the US Environmental Protection Agency's fueleconomy.gov web site, so that range might not be comparable to official EPA ranges of other electric cars.
The Kandi K27 gets that far, at least in part, by not asking much from its small 18 kilowatt-hour battery pack.
For customers looking for something more like a "real car," Kandi offers the K23.
"We want to have a new category for people who are thinking, 'Hey, I want an electric car, I want to do good for the environment, but I also want to save money.'"
(Another Kandi car, the Coco, an electric car that looked similar to Daimler's Smart car, was sold in the US years ago by an outside company.)

接下来是一层背景颜色，通常为白色，但并非总是如此（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板应用了最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，合并和收购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
