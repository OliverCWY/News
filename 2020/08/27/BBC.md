29岁的雅各布·布莱克（Jacob Blake）周日靠在汽车上，并注视着孩子，遭到警察开枪打伤。
他的家人说，布雷克先生正在医院康复，并且意识清楚。
关于布莱克枪击事件的抗议有时变得猛烈，造成财产损失。
据信，周二晚上的事件涉及抗议者，抗议布莱克的枪击事件以及武装人员守卫加油站。
布莱克周日遭到枪击后数小时，数百人在基诺沙警察总部外集会。

Jacob Blake, 29, was shot and injured by police on Sunday as he leaned into his car and as his children watched.
Mr Blake is recovering in hospital and is conscious, his family say.
The protests over Mr Blake's shooting have at times turned violent, causing damage to property.
Tuesday night's incident was believed to have involved protesters against Mr Blake's shooting and armed men guarding a petrol station.
Hours after Mr Blake was shot on Sunday, hundreds rallied outside Kenosha's police headquarters.

威斯康星州雅各布·布雷克（Jacob Blake）的骇人听闻枪击事件搅动了一个无需进一步搅动的锅。
没有人提出过这样一个问题，为什么过分使用武力似乎经常会涉及白人警察和黑人受害者。
总统没有说布雷克在后排被击中七次。
为了公平对待第一夫人梅拉尼娅·特朗普（Melania Trump），她昨晚确实以镇定而谨慎的方式讨论了种族正义问题。
也许当迈克·彭斯（Mike Pence）今天晚上发表讲话，而总统明天结束会议时，其中一些更广泛的问题将得到解决。

The appalling shooting of Jacob Blake in Wisconsin has stirred a pot that was in no need of further agitation.
No one has raised the question of why it is that excessive force disproportionately often seems to involve white police officers and black victims.
The president has said nothing about Blake being shot in the back seven times.
In fairness to the first lady, Melania Trump, she did discuss questions of racial justice in a calm and measured way last night.
And maybe when Mike Pence speaks this evening, and the president winds up the convention tomorrow, some of these wider issues will be addressed.

在为期四天的量刑听证会的第三天，亲戚和幸存者在法庭上发表声明的时间为三天。新西兰发生清真寺枪击事件的幸存者和受害者家属对枪手布伦顿·塔兰特（Brenton Tarrant）表示反对。
空中弥漫着一种悲伤的感觉，但也有一种蔑视之情，几乎有90人谈到了这一事件，该事件在基督城造成51人死亡。
卡塞姆女士开始哭泣，看着塔兰特，说：“这些眼泪不适合你。”
瓦瑟姆·达拉格米（Wasseim Daragmih）说，塔兰特（Tarrant）的任务失败了。
达拉格米的话很快变得严肃起来，说塔兰特“未能”摧毁他们的社区”。

经济合作与发展组织（OECD）表示，从4月到6月，英国在主要经济体中受到Covid-19的打击最大。
由于冠状病毒封锁措施使该国正式陷入衰退，其经济经历了三个月以来的最大跌幅。
智库称，该国20.4％的收缩率远高于整个37个经合组织国家9.8％的降幅。
西班牙位居第二，跌幅为18.5％。
由于依赖受打击最严重的行业-购物，服务和款待-英国遭受了最大的跌幅之一。

Its economy suffered its biggest slump on record over the three-month period as coronavirus lockdown measures pushed the country officially into recession.
Its 20.4% contraction was well above the 9.8% drop for the 37 OECD nations as a whole, the think tank said.
Spain was the next worst hit, with a decline of 18.5%.
And with its reliance on the worst hit sectors - shopping, services and hospitality - the UK suffered one the biggest drops.

德国已同意将对冠状病毒大流行影响工人的薪酬再延长一年。
除了延长短期工作补贴，联盟还同意继续为中小型公司提供财务帮助。
短期工作补贴原定于2021年3月到期，但延长至明年年底。
根据该计划，工人获得政府薪金的80％，即每月最高2500英镑。
但是自本月初以来，企业不得不开始通过支付员工的国民保险和养老金来为该计划供款。

As well as prolonging short-term work subsidies, coalition parties also agreed to continue financial help for small and medium-sized companies.
Short-time work subsidies had been due to expire in March 2021, but were extended until the end of next year.
Under the scheme, workers get 80% of their salaries paid for by the government - up to £2,500 a month.
But since the start of this month, firms have had to start contributing to the scheme by paying employees' national insurance and pension contributions.

盖特威克机场（Gatwick Airport）透露，由于冠状病毒的影响，该公司计划裁员四分之一。
乘客人数减少80％后，可能会失去约600个工作岗位。
3月，机场宣布将失去200个工作岗位，后来又向银行贷款3亿英镑。
工会联合会地区经理杰米·梅杰尔（Jamie Major）说，大约有600个工作岗位约占盖特威克直接雇用的劳动力的四分之一。
盖特威克航空宣布这一消息之前，有消息称英国航空公司将在西萨塞克斯郡的机场裁员数百人。

Gatwick's announcement follows the news that British Airways will make hundreds of job cuts at the airport in West Sussex.

几家公司已经宣布，他们没有计划在深秋之前返回办公室，而Facebook表示，它不计划在2021年7月之前遣散员工。
“办公室工作人员对我们至关重要。

Some 24 firms said that they did not have any plans in place to return workers to the office.
It comes as many employees return to work from the summer holidays with the reality of a prolonged period of home working becoming increasingly likely.
The BBC questioned 50 big employers ranging from banks to retailers to get a sense of when they expected to ask employees to return to the office.
A few firms have already announced they have no plans to return to the office until late autumn, and Facebook has said it does not plan a return of employees until July 2021.

图片版权Getty Images维珍大西洋航空公司（Virgin Atlantic）获得了其债权人的一项12亿英镑救助计划的支持，该计划将确保其未来至少18个月并挽救6,500个工作岗位。
维珍航空表示，该协议使它能够“重建其资产负债表”并“欢迎乘客返回”。
这笔12亿英镑的救助交易涉及4亿英镑的新现金，其中一半来自其主要股东理查德·布兰森爵士的维珍集团。
拥有维珍航空49％股份的美国航空公司达美航空表示，“对该计划将使维珍航空确保其未来持乐观态度”，并表示仍“坚定地支持”该公司。
上个月，维珍航空因在大流行期间被取消的航班的退款处理延迟而面临执法行动。

Image copyright Getty ImagesVirgin Atlantic has won backing from its creditors for a £1.2bn rescue plan that would secure its future for at least 18 months and save 6,500 jobs.
Virgin Atlantic said the agreement puts it in a position to "rebuild its balance sheet" and "welcome passengers back".
The £1.2bn rescue deal involves £400m in new cash, half of which will come from its main shareholder, Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group.
Delta, the US-based airline which owns 49% of Virgin Atlantic, said it is "optimistic that this plan will allow Virgin Atlantic to secure its future", and said it remains "firmly supportive" of the company.
Last month, Virgin Atlantic faced enforcement action over its delays in processing refunds for flights cancelled during the pandemic.
