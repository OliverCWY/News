(CNN) Clara Paulino, the wife of a Miami police officer, died after being found unconscious in the back of her husband's police SUV last week amid temperatures in the 90s.

Paulino was found by her son and her husband, police officer Aristides Paulino, a little after 5 p.m. Friday, Matt Reyes, the vice president of the Miami Fraternal Order of Police, told CNN.

A cause of death has not been released.

"It is a tragic accident and has rocked the Paulino family to its core," Reyes added. The Miami Herald is reporting that investigators are treating Paulino's death "as a horrific accident."

Miami-Dade Police Public Information Officer Detective Angel Rodriguez said there is "an unclassified death investigation which is open and active for Clara Paulino," but he couldn't give any additional details.
