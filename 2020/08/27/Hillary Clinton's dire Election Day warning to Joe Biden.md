(CNN) Hillary Clinton has a bit of advice for Joe Biden come November 3: Don't even think about conceding if the election is at all close.

"Joe Biden should not concede under any circumstances because I think this is going to drag out, and eventually I do believe he will win if we don't give an inch and if we are as focused and relentless as the other side is," Clinton told longtime Democratic strategist Jennifer Palmieri in an excerpt of Showtime's "The Circus" released Tuesday . Added Clinton: "We've got to have a massive legal operation, I know the Biden campaign is working on that. We have to have poll workers, and I urge people, who are able, to be a poll worker. We have to have our own teams of people to counter the force of intimidation that the Republicans and Trump are going to put outside polling places. This is a big organizational challenge, but at least we know more about what they're going to do."

What Clinton envisions is an election night that could well extend into an election week or even -- gulp\! -- an election month, because of an expected surge in mail-in balloting due to concerns about the coronavirus. If recent elections, particularly in Clinton's adopted home state of New York, are any indication, there's a very real possibility that no winner is declared on November 3 or November 4. And that the country will be in limbo, while waiting to know who will be the next president of the United States.

Even with a semi-traditional president in the White House, that is a situation absolutely fraught with peril. The single most important part of an election is that people believe that the vote was fairly counted and, whether or not they like the result, that it was an accurate reflection of what the country wanted. The longer it goes without a declared winner, the more people will suspect that something nefarious could be going on -- even if the delay isn't solely the result of the slowness in counting a surge of mailed-in ballots.

Donald Trump is, of course, not a semi-traditional president. Or anything close to it. In fact, he has spent the last several months suggesting to anyone who will listen that the increase in mail-in balloting will lead to a "rigged" and fraudulent election. (There is zero evidence of the sort of widespread voter fraud in mail-in balloting that Trump is alleging.)
