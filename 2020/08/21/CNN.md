特朗普对乔·拜登（Joe Biden）作为对手的恐惧如此强烈，以至于总统因试图在他身上挖土而被弹each。
但是拜登（Biden）是位来自工业心脏地带的白人，通俗易懂的虔诚天主教徒。
拜登看起来几乎没有特朗普最激进的激进分子用来激怒他的基地的部分。
但在大选中，这段历史成为财富，为准备解雇特朗普的中间人选民提供了安慰。
特朗普很可能把他当作特洛伊木马，民主党人将用来促进社会主义，违法行为和文化没收。

Trump's fear of Joe Biden as an opponent is so pronounced that the President was impeached for trying to dig up dirt on him.
But Biden -- a White, plain-spoken, devout Catholic from the industrial heartland -- is a culturally inconvenient target.
Biden hardly looks the part of the far left radical Trump would use to rile up his base.
But in a general election, this history serves as an asset, offering comfort to middle-of-the-road voters who are ready to fire Trump.
Trump is likely to cast him as a trojan horse the Democrats will use to promote socialism, lawlessness and cultural expropriation.

## 关于澳大利亚总理疫苗评论的争议指出了下一个冠状病毒的噩梦

他的卫生部长卡伦·安德鲁斯（Karen Andrews）稍后重申了这一立场，称政府正在“将其视为强制性疫苗”。
在Instagram上，美国领先的反vaxx活动家和Stop Mandatory Vaccines的创始人Larry Cook写道：“澳大利亚正在努力进行强制性Covid疫苗接种。”
尽管本周早些时候美国顶级传染病专家安东尼·福西（Anthony Fauci）博士保证说，强制性冠状病毒疫苗仍不太可能出现。
如果没有有效的冠状病毒疫苗，目前似乎没有其他可行的方法可以恢复大流行前的正常状态。
但是，通过使用威胁或什至模糊的建议授权对抗潜在的冠状病毒疫苗，抗vaxxer实际上使这种命令的可能性更大。

His health minister, Karen Andrews, reiterated that line later, saying the government was "looking at it being a mandatory vaccine."
On Instagram, Larry Cook, a leading US anti-vaxx campaigner and founder of Stop Mandatory Vaccines, wrote that "Australia is pushing hard for mandatory Covid vaccination."
This is despite assurances earlier this week from the US' top infectious diseases expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, that a compulsory coronavirus vaccine remains highly unlikely.
Without an effective coronavirus vaccine, there currently appears to be no other viable way to return to pre-pandemic normality.
But by using the threat or even vague suggestion of a mandate to campaign against a potential coronavirus vaccine, anti-vaxxers are actually making such an order more likely.

万斯的办公室一直在调查特朗普或特朗普组织是否在向妇女指控与特朗普发生关系的秘密付款方面违反了州法律。
多年以来，特朗普已起诉万斯（Vance）停止其长期会计公司Mazars USA的大陪审团传票。
传票要求马扎斯提供与特朗普，特朗普组织，他的基金会和几个相关子公司有关的记录。
“虽然马扎斯传票很可能是出于特定目的而发出的，但由于缺乏将马扎斯传票与那些政客联系起来的具体事实，法院无法合理地推断马扎斯传票反映了为推进民主党的目标而不是合法目标的努力。 ，”他的意见说。
众议院民主党人分别从马扎斯那里传唤了与万斯相同的特朗普会计记录集。

Vance's office has been examining whether Trump or the Trump Organization violated state laws in connection with hush money payments made to women alleging affairs with Trump.
Trump had sued Vance to stop the grand jury subpoena of his longtime accounting firm Mazars USA for years of his records.
The subpoena asked for records from Mazars related to Trump, the Trump Organization, his foundation and several related subsidiaries.
"While the Mazars Subpoena may well have been issued for that particular purpose, the lack of specific facts tying the Mazars Subpoena to those politicians prevents the Court from reasonably inferring that the Mazars Subpoena reflects an effort to advance the Democrats' goals rather than legitimate ones," his opinion said.
House Democrats separately subpoenaed the same set of Trump accounting records as Vance from Mazars.

俄罗斯莫斯科反对党领袖，直言不讳的克里姆林宫批评家阿列克谢·纳瓦尼（Alexey Navalny）因涉嫌中毒病倒，目前处于昏迷状态。
Yarmysh告诉俄罗斯俄罗斯电台Echo，他只有在起飞前在机场咖啡馆喝红茶。
Navalny最初被转移到鄂木斯克第二急诊室的急性中毒病房。
Yarmysh补充说：“医生的回避反应只证实这是中毒的。”
中毒主张其他克里姆林宫批评家或反对者参与了明显的中毒事件或神秘死亡。

Moscow (CNN) Russian opposition leader and outspoken Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny is in a coma after falling ill from suspected poisoning, his spokeswoman said Thursday.
He only drank black tea in an airport cafe before takeoff, Yarmysh told Russian radio station Echo of Moscow.
Moving to an undisclosed locationNavalny was initially admitted to the acute poisoning unit of Omsk emergency hospital No.
"The evasive reaction of doctors only confirms that this is poisoning," Yarmysh added.
Poisoning claimsOther Kremlin critics or opponents have been involved in apparent poisoning incidents or suffered mysterious deaths.

特朗普最初在被问及是否会拒绝杜克的支持时说：“我什至不知道你在谈论白人至上还是白人至上主义者。”
“所以我不知道。

But I don't know much about the movement.
What, specifically, is Trump associating himself with when he says nice things about QAnon, you ask?
"I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists," Trump said initially when asked whether he would disavow Duke's support.

（CNN）-为解决Airbnb列表上未经授权的当事人的持续存在的问题，该问题因大流行和公共卫生风险而加剧，这家出租庞然大物周四发布了一项禁令，禁止全球各地的当事人参加。
Airbnb在公告中说：“该聚会禁令适用于以后在Airbnb上进行的所有预订，并且将一直有效，直到另行通知。”
该公司指出，全球有73％的Airbnb房源已在其房屋守则中禁止了聚会。
但是在2019年，该公司对聚会进行了更严格的限制，禁止了持续引起邻里干扰的“聚会所”。
违反新规定的房东或客人可能会受到Airbnb社区的禁令和可能的法律诉讼。

(CNN) — Addressing an ongoing problem with unauthorized parties at Airbnb listings that has been aggravated by the pandemic and public health risks, the rental behemoth issued a ban Thursday on parties at properties worldwide.
"This party ban applies to all future bookings on Airbnb and it will remain in effect indefinitely until further notice," Airbnb said in its announcement.
The company noted that 73% of Airbnb listings worldwide already banned parties in their house rules.
But in 2019, the company put stricter limits on parties, banning "party houses" that were consistently causing neighborhood disturbances.
Bans from the Airbnb community and possible legal action could result for hosts or guests who break the new rules.

New York (CNN Business) China's economy has bounced back from the Covid-19 outbreak in China's Wuhan province.
That's great news for Alibaba, the e-commerce and cloud giant.

Overall revenue was up nearly 35% from a year ago and the company also posted solid increases in total and mobile users.
"It's easy to be blasé about Alibaba posting revenue growth of 34% in the pandemic.

如果新的科学论据得到证实，那么人们认为登上飞机的更高风险可能是没有根据的。
低传播风险乘客乘飞机捕捉Covid-19并因病毒丧生的几率不到百万分之一。
巴内特说，在确定总体传播风险之前，他已经考虑了所有这些可能性。
“从统计上讲，在满载的飞机上，靠窗座位比中间座位或过道座位要安全一些。
加强保护有些专家建议乘客应该戴好防护罩和口罩以加强保护。

If new scientific claims are borne out, the perceived heightened risk of boarding an airplane could be unfounded.
Low transmission riskThe odds of a passenger catching Covid-19 on a flight and dying from the virus are less than one in half a million.
Barnett says he took all of these probabilities into account before determining an overall transmission risk.
"Statistically, the window seat is a little safer than the middle seat or the aisle seat on a plane that's full.
Enhanced protectionSome experts have suggested that passengers should wear a shield as well as a mask for greater protection.

The Indian Health Service, which is responsible for providing services to American Indians and Alaska Natives, is typically underfunded at between 50% to 60% of need, according to the National Council of Urban Indian Health .
Still, organizations that advocate for Black, Latino and Native Americans have been working during the pandemic to make sure their communities get the support they need.
The National Indian Health Board is demanding billion-dollar investments from the federal government for water and sanitation infrastructure and Indian Health Service facilities in tribal communities, among other priorities.

（CNN）在2021年和2022年向佛罗里达礁岛地区释放超过7.5亿只转基因蚊子的计划获得了地方当局的最终批准，反对许多当地居民的反对和环境倡导团体的联合。
我们不知道，因为EPA非法拒绝认真分析环境风险，现在无需进一步审查风险，试验就可以继续进行。”
该试验项目于五月获得环境保护署的批准，旨在测试转基因蚊子是否可以替代喷洒杀虫剂来控制埃及伊蚊。
它是一种蚊子，携带多种致命疾病，如寨卡病毒，登革热，基孔肯雅热和黄热病。
只有雌蚊叮咬血液，她需要使卵成熟。

(CNN) A plan to release over 750 million genetically modified mosquitoes into the Florida Keys in 2021 and 2022 received final approval from local authorities, against the objection of many local residents and a coalition of environmental advocacy groups.
We don't know, because EPA unlawfully refused to seriously analyze environmental risks, now without further review of the risks, the experiment can proceed," she added.
Approved by the Environment Protection Agency in May, the pilot project is designed to test if a genetically modified mosquito is a viable alternative to spraying insecticides to control the Aedes aegypti.
It's a species of mosquito that carries several deadly diseases, such as Zika, dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever.
Only the female mosquito bites for blood, which she needs to mature her eggs.

CNN正在展示The Conversation的工作，这是记者和学者之间的合作，旨在提供新闻分析和评论。
在超时期间，父母和其他监护人会暂时停止关注孩子，并使孩子安静地坐下来并保持冷静。
研究人员一遍又一遍地发现，超时通常可以正常工作-只要父母和其他主要护理人员始终遵循五个特定步骤即可。
父母和孩子都需要每次都遵循所有这些步骤，以便超时工作。
但是，在大多数家庭中，我发现超时是有效的，因为年幼的孩子意识到打球和其他不良行为会给他们带来不必要的休息乐趣。

CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation , a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary.
During timeouts, parents and other guardians briefly stop paying attention to their child and make the child sit quietly and calm down.
Researchers have found over and over that timeouts generally work well -- as long as parents and other primary caregivers consistently follow five specific steps.
Both parents and children need to follow all of these steps every time for timeouts to work.
In most families, however, I find that timeouts work because young children realize that hitting and other kinds of misbehavior will bring about an unwanted break from having fun.

内斯特了解到，除了成为研究对象的危害外，口呼吸还会破坏一夜安眠。
科学家发现，夜间通过嘴呼吸会使您患上睡眠障碍的风险更高，包括打nor，睡眠呼吸暂停和呼吸不足，部分空气阻塞。
这并不意味着您注定要发呆，因为您睡觉时容易口呼吸。
“即使您没有睡眠呼吸暂停或轻度睡眠呼吸暂停，张开嘴也会使这种情况变得非常严重。”
如果您要在夜间进行口呼吸，Park建议您从照顾鼻子开始，以最大程度地减少交通堵塞。

What Nestor learned, aside from the hazards of being a research subject, was that mouth breathing can ruin a good night's sleep.
Breathing through your mouth at night puts you at higher risk for sleep disorders including snoring, sleep apnea and hypopnea , the partial blockage of air, scientists have found .
That doesn't mean you're doomed to wake up in a daze because you're prone to mouth breathing when you sleep.
"Even if you don't have sleep apnea, or you have mild sleep apnea, opening your mouth makes it much, much worse."
If you're tackling your nighttime mouth breathing, Park suggested you start by taking care of your nose to minimize congestion.

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-当通过吸引人的飞机制服吸引公众注意时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常是白色，但并不总是白色（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板应用了最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，合并和收购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
