周四（8月20日），Google在全球范围内发生了7个小时的停电，影响了其许多服务，包括电子邮件，存储，文档和视频会议。
在Covid-19大流行期间，这种中断给用户带来了冲击，而这正是他们最需要工具才能保持生产力的时候。
许多用户（包括新加坡用户）无法登录其Gmail帐户，而某些用户则无法发送或接收附件。
其他人则无法在其Google云端硬盘中创建文件，无法通过Google聊天发布消息以及录制“见面”视频会议会话。
根据第三方Web监控公司DownDetector的说法，Google服务问题最早是在星期四中午左右才报告的。

SINGAPORE - Google suffered a seven-hour global outage on Thursday (Aug 20) that affected many of its services, including e-mail, storage, document and videoconferencing.
The disruption hit users at a time when they needed the tools most to stay productive amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
Many users including those in Singapore could not log into their Gmail accounts while some could not send or receive attachments.
Others could not create files in their Google Drive, post messages via Google Chat and record Meet videoconferencing sessions.
According to third-party Web monitoring company DownDetector, problems with Google services were first reported at around noon around the world on Thursday.

Food waste is a big issue in China.
This is not the first time Mr Xi has launched such a movement.

特朗普于2017年8月从白宫职位上解雇了班农。
现年66岁的班农（Bannon）是曼哈顿联邦检察官逮捕和指控的四人之一，他们共谋犯电汇欺诈和共谋洗钱。
检察官指控被告通过一项名为“我们筑墙”的2500万美元（3400万新元）的众筹活动欺骗了成千上万的捐助者。
指控称，巴农用其中的数十万美元来支付个人开支。
检察官说，捐助者被告知，他们所有的捐款都将被隔离。

Trump fired Bannon from his White House post in August 2017.
Bannon, 66, was among four people arrested and charged by federal prosecutors in Manhattan with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.
Prosecutors accused the defendants of defrauding hundreds of thousands of donors through a US$25 million (S$34 million) crowdfunding campaign called We Build The Wall.
Bannon used hundreds of thousands of dollars of that money to cover personal expenses, according to the charges.
Donors were told that all of their contributions would go towards a wall, prosecutors said.

新德里（AFP）-周四（8月20日）发布的一项研究表明，新德里2000万居民中有超过四分之一的人感染了新型冠状病毒而没有出现症状，这引发了人们对印度官方病例数的新怀疑。
推断，对1.5万名居民进行的抗体研究意味着，在熙熙capital的首都中，有580万人可能感染了这种病毒-是官方统计的156139例感染的37倍以上。
6月至7月的一项类似调查显示，该市23％的受测人员已感染该病毒。
另一位在7月下旬发现在孟买贫民窟中接受测试的人中有57％感染了艾滋病毒-远远超过官方数据显示的水平。
他说：“它不能应用于整个城市。”他指出，浦那的研究是在城市人口稠密的地区进行的。

NEW DELHI (AFP) - More than a quarter of New Delhi's 20 million residents may have caught the novel coronavirus without showing symptoms, a study released on Thursday (Aug 20) indicated, raising fresh doubts about India's official case numbers.
Extrapolated, the antibody study on 15,000 residents means 5.8 million people in the bustling capital could have caught the virus - more than 37 times the official tally of 156,139 infections.
A similar survey in June-July said 23 per cent of people tested had been exposed to the virus in the city.
Another in late July found 57 per cent of those tested in Mumbai's slums had the infection - far more than official data suggests.
"It can't be applied to the whole city," he said, noting that the Pune study was done in a very densely populated area of the city.

Airlangga University and BIN first announced they discovered five combinations of drugs to fight Covid-19 in June.
In the ensuing clinical trials, they applied three of these five combinations.
Researchers have to specify inclusion and exclusion criteria for participation in every clinical trial, factoring in the participants' age, sex, and previous medical history.
