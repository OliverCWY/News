By the 1860s, with a skilled surgeon in a modern European hospital you had about an eight-in-10 chance of surviving an operation. But your odds of leaving hospital alive were about 50/50.

Infection and disease ravaged hospital wards. As surgeons moved between patients examining wounds and probing gangrenous tissue, they couldn’t understand why so many in their charge were dying. The condition became known as hospitalism – today we would call it sepsis or blood poisoning – and medical staff surmised it was caused by bad smells, or a miasma, permeating the air.

“There was no sense of cleanliness or the risk of infection that we understand today,” says Rowan Parks, a consultant surgeon and vice-president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.

“Surgeons wore their outdoor coats, the bed linen wasn’t washed regularly, they carried their instruments around in their pockets – concepts that we find horrifying today were normal.”

Some surgeons even proudly reused bandages and dressings between patients, preferring not to waste valuable hospital resources.

With increased mechanisation and the growth of the railways, industrial injuries were common. As a result, the vast bulk of surgery involved removing limbs. If, for instance, a patient suffered a compound fracture, where bone penetrated the skin, the wound would almost certainly become infected. A surgeon would have little choice but to amputate. Although operations were now being carried out under anaesthetics, outcomes were, if anything, worse.

During his first four years as professor of surgery in newly built wards at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Joseph Lister’s mortality rates were about average. He knew that around half his patients would die. Unlike many of his colleagues, however, Lister was determined to do something about it.
