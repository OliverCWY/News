纳瓦尼现年44岁，多年来一直是普京总统最坚定的批评家之一。
纳瓦尼先生于2011年成立的反腐败基金会新闻秘书基拉·亚米什（Kira Yarmysh）在推特上写道：“今天上午，纳瓦尼正从托木斯克返回莫斯科。
纳瓦尼先生于2013年7月因挪用公款罪而短暂入狱，但谴责该判决具有政治性。
在呼吁未经授权的抗议后，纳瓦尼先生还于2019年7月被判处30天监禁。
纳瓦尔尼先生在2017年遭到绿色抗菌染料袭击时，右眼还遭受了严重的化学灼伤。

Mr Navalny, 44, has for years been among President Vladimir Putin's staunchest critics.
Kira Yarmysh, the press secretary for the Anti-Corruption Foundation, which Mr Navalny founded in 2011, tweeted: "This morning Navalny was returning to Moscow from Tomsk.
Mr Navalny was briefly jailed in July 2013 on embezzlement charges but denounced the sentence as political.
Mr Navalny was also given a 30-day jail term in July 2019 after calling for unauthorised protests.
Mr Navalny also suffered a serious chemical burn to his right eye in 2017 when he was assaulted with green, antiseptic dye.

在以哈利·波特为主题的抗议活动后，该中心的阿农·南帕被捕。泰国警方已逮捕了九人，针对的是最近反政府抗议活动的积极分子。
九名律师中有律师阿南·南帕（Anon Nampa），他因在曼谷举行的一场以哈利·波特为主题的抗议中被指控，他呼吁改革君主制。
但是最近几周，学生和其他激进主义者走上街头呼吁对该机构进行改革。
36岁的Anon先生是本月初举行的抗议活动中第一个公开打破禁忌的人。
近年来，由于泰国国王瓦吉拉隆功（Vajiralongkorn）已宣布他不再希望如此广泛地使用该法规，因此该法规的使用速度有所放缓。

Among the nine was lawyer Anon Nampa, who was charged over a Harry Potter-themed protest in Bangkok at which he called for reform of the monarchy.
But in recent weeks, students and other activists have taken to the streets to call for reforms of the institution.
Mr Anon, 36, was the first to openly break the taboo at the protest, which took place earlier this month.
The use of this legislation has slowed in recent years as Thai King Vajiralongkorn has let it be known he no longer wants it so widely used.

到1860年代，在欧洲现代医院中，熟练的外科医生为您提供了幸存的机会，十分之八。
感染和疾病肆虐医院病房。
当外科医生在检查伤口和探查坏疽组织的患者之间移动时，他们无法理解为什么这么多负责人快要死了。
爱丁堡皇家外科医学院副院长，外科医生罗恩·帕克斯（Rowan Parks）说：“我们今天所了解的，没有清洁感或感染风险。”
例如，如果患者遭受复合骨折，骨头穿透皮肤，那么伤口几乎肯定会被感染。

By the 1860s, with a skilled surgeon in a modern European hospital you had about an eight-in-10 chance of surviving an operation.
Infection and disease ravaged hospital wards.
As surgeons moved between patients examining wounds and probing gangrenous tissue, they couldn’t understand why so many in their charge were dying.
“There was no sense of cleanliness or the risk of infection that we understand today,” says Rowan Parks, a consultant surgeon and vice-president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.
If, for instance, a patient suffered a compound fracture, where bone penetrated the skin, the wound would almost certainly become infected.

## 佛罗里达蚊子：7.5亿只转基因昆虫将被释放

计划于2021年在一系列岛屿佛罗里达群岛（Florida Keys）释放蚊子，这一计划是在经过联邦监管机构批准后才数月的。
今年五月，美国环境署批准了总部位于英国，由美国经营的Oxitec公司生产基因工程的雄性埃及伊蚊的生产，该蚊被称为OX5034。
埃及伊蚊（Aedes aegypti）蚊子会向人类传播致命疾病，例如登革热，寨卡病毒，基孔肯雅热和黄热病。
因此，计划是释放雄性，改良型蚊子，然后有望与野生雌性蚊子繁殖。
周二，佛罗里达礁岛群蚊子控制区（FKMCD）的官员最终批准在两年内释放7.5亿只经过改良的蚊子。

The plan to release the mosquitoes in 2021 in the Florida Keys, a string of islands, comes months after the modified mosquitoes were approved by federal regulators.
In May, the US Environmental Agency granted permission to the British-based, US-operated company Oxitec to produce the genetically engineered, male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which are known as OX5034.
Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are known to spread deadly diseases to humans such dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever.
So the plan is to release the male, modified mosquitoes who will then hopefully breed with wild female mosquitoes.
On Tuesday, officials in the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District (FKMCD) gave final approval to release 750 million of the modified mosquitoes over a two-year period.

对于美国以外的世界来说，这将是一代人以来最重要的美国总统大选。
如果乔·拜登获胜，那么美国将重新加入世界卫生组织；返回《巴黎气候变化协定》；并再次承诺与伊朗达成核协议，以使德黑兰重返全面遵守状态。
时间将很短，但即使是与俄罗斯签订的新的《减少战略武器条约》，也将于2月到期，可以延长。
但是拜登担任总统一职将不仅是特朗普时代的覆灭或奥巴马/拜登时代的回归。
在第二次世界大战后建立的由美国主导的国际体系正在分裂。

For the world beyond America’s shores this will be the most important US Presidential election for a generation.
If Joe Biden wins then expect the US to re-join the World Health Organisation; return to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change; and commit again to the Iran nuclear deal, providing Tehran returns to full compliance.
Time will be short, but even the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia, which expires in February, could be extended.
But a Biden presidency will not simply be the undoing of the Trump years or a return to the approach of the Obama/Biden years.
The international system dominated by America, that was established in the aftermath of World War Two is fragmenting.

据称，轮奸案发生在以色列度假胜地埃拉特（Eilat）。以色列警方已对南部度假胜地埃拉特的一家旅馆中的一名16岁女孩的轮奸案进行了调查。
据当地媒体报道，其中一名嫌疑人说，有三十多名男子与该女孩发生性关系，但否认强奸。
根据以色列媒体的报道，她本月初与一位朋友一起去了埃拉特，并结识了一群朋友的熟人。
两名被拘留的嫌疑人的身份尚未对外公布，但当地媒体报道称他们是20多岁的以色列居民。
去年，一名19岁的英国妇女声称自己在塞浦路斯的一家旅馆被12名以色列男子轮奸。

One of the suspects said more than 30 men had sex with the girl, but denied rape, according to local media reports.
According to Israeli media reports, she went to Eilat earlier this month with a friend, and met up with a group of the friend's acquaintances.
The identities of the two detained suspects have not been made public, but local media reports say they are Israeli residents in their 20s.
Last year, a 19-year-old British woman claimed she had been gang-raped by 12 Israeli men at a hotel in Cyprus.

官方数据显示，上周寻求失业救济的美国人人数意外回升至100万以上。
美国劳工部表示，这一数字上升至110万，超出了经济学家的预期92.5万。
股票经纪人查尔斯·施瓦布（Charles Schwab）英国董事总经理理查德·弗林（Richard Flynn）表示：“今天初请失业金人数的增加将令市场失望，尤其是在上周的前景乐观的数据公布之后。”
失业率在10％以上。
缺乏协议意味着国会在大流行期间批准的每周600美元的补充失业补助金于7月底到期。

The US Labor Department said claims rose to 1.1 million, ahead of economists' forecasts of 925,000.
"Today's rise in initial jobless will disappoint the market, especially following last week's promising data," said Richard Flynn, UK managing director at stock broker Charles Schwab.
The unemployment rate is above 10%.
The lack of agreement meant that an extra $600 weekly top up that Congress approved for unemployment benefits during the pandemic expired at the end of July.

在法院批准了紧急禁令之后，优步和Lyft已连续获得加州司机的就业权缓刑。
乘车公司曾威胁要暂停运营，因为之前的一项裁决必须将驾驶员归类为雇员，而不是承包商。
法院已下令Uber和Lyft都在9月初之前提交聘用员工的计划，该案的口头辩论定于10月中旬进行。
Lyft原定于当地时间周四23:59（周五格林尼治标准时间06:59）停止在加利福尼亚的服务。
法官裁定该法律同时适用于Uber和Lyft，这意味着公司需要为司机提供额外的福利，例如失业保护。

Image copyright ReutersUber and Lyft have been granted a reprieve in a row over drivers' employment rights in California after a court granted an emergency injunction.
The ride-hailing firms had threatened to suspend operations over an earlier ruling that they must classify drivers as employees, not contractors.
The court has ordered Uber and Lyft to both submit their plans for hiring employees by early September, and oral arguments in the case are set for mid-October.
Lyft was due to stop its services in California at 23:59 local time on Thursday (06:59 GMT on Friday).
The judge's ruling that the law applied to both Uber and Lyft means the firms need to provide drivers with extra benefits, such as unemployment protection.

苹果老板蒂姆·库克泰克（Tim CookTech）巨人苹果公司已经成为美国第一家在股市上估值达到20亿美元（合1.5亿英镑）的公司。
其股价在周三美国早盘交易中达到467.77美元，使其突破了2tn大关。
唯一一家达到20亿美元水平的公司是去年12月上市的国有沙特阿美公司。
但此后，这家石油巨头的价值已回落至$ 1.8tn，苹果公司在7月底超越了它，成为全球最有价值的交易公司。
实际上，自三月份对冠状病毒大流行的恐慌席卷市场以来，其股价已自三月份的低点翻了一番。

Its share price hit $467.77 in mid-morning trading in the US on Wednesday to push it over the $2tn mark.
The only other company to reach the $2tn level was state-backed Saudi Aramco after it listed its shares last December.
But the oil giant's value has slipped back to $1.8tn since then and Apple surpassed it to become the world's most valuable traded company at the end of July.
In fact, its share price has doubled since its low point in March, when panic about the coronavirus pandemic swept the markets.
