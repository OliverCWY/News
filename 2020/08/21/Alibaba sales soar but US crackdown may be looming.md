New York (CNN Business) China's economy has bounced back from the Covid-19 outbreak in China's Wuhan province. That's great news for Alibaba, the e-commerce and cloud giant. But the company also acknowledged the threat of being caught up in the burgeoning trade war between the United States and China.

Alibaba BABA posted strong sales and earnings growth Thursday morning that topped Wall Street's forecasts. Overall revenue was up nearly 35% from a year ago and the company also posted solid increases in total and mobile users.

"It's easy to be blasé about Alibaba posting revenue growth of 34% in the pandemic. But it's important to remember that Alibaba sells goods each year to the value of the GDP of the Netherlands," said Martin Garner, chief operations officer of CCS Insight. "Growing an enormous operation at this pace is an amazing achievement."

Still, the stock fell about 2% Thursday. But it is up more than 20% so far in 2020.

"Although the global community continues to struggle with uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, we have seen encouraging signs of recovery in China due to effective management of the outbreak in vast majority of the country," said Alibaba chairman and CEO Daniel Zhang during a call with analysts.
