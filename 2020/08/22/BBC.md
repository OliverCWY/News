塞维利亚已经赢得了在欧足联国王联赛中打过的所有六场欧联杯或欧罗巴联赛决赛，这要归功于塞维利亚第六次在科隆令人振奋的决赛中战胜国际米兰赢得了本次赛事的冠军。
那是他连续第三次在欧罗巴联赛中失球，在前两轮击败狼队和曼联的比赛中也取得了同样的成绩。
塞维利亚要么进入下一轮比赛，要么在最近22场欧罗巴淘汰赛中赢得21场比赛。
国米后卫迭戈·戈丁继史蒂芬·杰拉德，埃尔南·克雷斯波，德米特里·阿列尼切夫，艾伦·西蒙森和佩德罗之后，成为第六位在欧洲杯/冠军联赛和欧洲联盟杯/欧洲联赛决赛中得分的球员。
塞维利亚的迭戈·卡洛斯（Diego Carlos）在2019-20赛季欧罗巴联赛中承认三分球，这是自2012-13赛季卡萨尔·阿斯皮里库埃塔（Carar Azpilicueta）切尔西以来首个在一次运动中承认如此多的球员。

That was the third Europa League game in a row that he conceded a spot-kick, doing the same in wins over Wolves and Manchester United in the previous two rounds.
Sevilla have either progressed to the next round or won the competition in 21 of their last 22 Europa League knockout ties.
Inter defender Diego Godin became the sixth player to score in a European Cup/Champions League and Uefa Cup/Europa League final, after Steven Gerrard, Hernan Crespo, Dmitri Alenichev, Allan Simonsen and Pedro.
Sevilla's Diego Carlos conceded three penalties in the 2019-20 Europa League, the first player to concede that many in a single campaign since Casar Azpilicueta in 2012-13 for Chelsea.

## Tenet评论：“感觉就像几个大片一样”

### Tenet review: ‘It feels like several blockbusters combined’

克里斯托弗·诺兰（Christopher Nolan）的《特奈》（Tenet）是近六个月来在电影院上映的第一部好莱坞大片。
执导过《盗梦空间》，《星际穿越》和《黑暗骑士》三部曲后，他并不是您与安静，私密的独立剧关联的人。
但是，看到如此如此之高的电影仍然令人吃惊，以至于当一个角色问小人是否正在计划进行核大屠杀时，另一个角色突然响起：“不。
不，我也不是，但重点是它使核大屠杀看起来像多米诺骨牌游戏。
但是很明显，诺兰（Nolan）没想到一个场景，就没有想过如何使它变得更加昂贵和昂贵。

Christopher Nolan’s Tenet is the first new Hollywood blockbuster to be released in cinemas in almost six months.
Having directed Inception, Interstellar, and the Dark Knight trilogy, he’s not someone you associate with quiet, intimate indie dramas.
But it’s still startling to see a film so over-the-top that when one character asks if the villains are planning a nuclear holocaust, another character snaps: “No.
No, me neither, but the point is that it makes a nuclear holocaust look like a game of dominos.
But it is obvious that Nolan didn’t think of a single scene without thinking how he could make it more excessive and expensive.

## 20秒的洗手液足以杀死Covid-19吗？

这是我们许多人本能地做的事情，几乎是每天做几次肌肉记忆。
在抵御冠状病毒的武器库（口罩，自我隔离和社会隔离）中，一个特别容易被忽视的是：洗手。
随着2月份冠状病毒成为全球性的突发卫生事件，卫生机构争先恐后地建议人们如何保护自己免受新病毒的侵害。
一种建议-在新闻公告，广告和专家访谈上日复一日地重复-建议在热水中用肥皂洗手至少20秒钟。
马萨诸塞州波士顿东北大学化学与化学生物学副教授托马斯·吉尔伯特（Thomas Gilbert）说，冠冕病毒的化学成分可以被廉价的肥皂和温水专门破坏。

It is something that many of us do instinctively, almost as muscle memory, several times a day.
Amidst the arsenal of weapons against coronavirus – masks, self-isolation and social distancing – one has been particularly easy to overlook: handwashing.
As the coronavirus emerged as a worldwide health emergency in February, health agencies scrambled to advise people how to protect themselves from the new virus.
One suggestion – repeated day after day, on news bulletins, adverts and expert interviews – was to wash hands with soap, in warm water, for at least 20 seconds.
Thomas Gilbert, an associate professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, says coronavirus’s chemical make-up can be disrupted by nothing more specialised than cheap soap and warm water.

欧盟已同意取消对美国龙虾的关税，这是唐纳德·特朗普总统的主要优先事项。
特朗普先生曾威胁要提高欧盟对欧洲汽车的关税，如果欧盟不终止其龙虾关税。
作为美中贸易争端的一部分，中国对甲壳类动物征收关税，而在欧盟市场上，该行业在加拿大签署了2017年自由贸易协议后取消了对欧洲龙虾的8％关税后，对加拿大的竞争对手失去了基础。
美国新的协议将降低龙虾的关税五年，但仍需获得欧盟政府和欧洲议会的批准。
本月初，美国避免因威胁欧洲对空中客车的补贴而提高关税。

Mr Trump had threatened higher tariffs on European cars if the EU did not end the lobster duties.
China slapped tariffs on the crustacean as part of the US-China trade dispute, while in the EU market, the industry has lost ground to competitors from Canada, after the country signed a 2017 free trade agreement eliminating Europe's 8% lobster tariffs.
The new US agreement, which would drop the lobster tariffs for five years, still needs approval from EU governments and the European Parliament.
Earlier this month, the US refrained from a rise in tariffs it had threatened over European subsidies for Airbus.

然而，尽管销售音乐的业务看起来更健康，但表演音乐的人以及使现场音乐成为可能的人们仍在遭受痛苦。
同时，一家创新公司找到了一种将现场音乐带给广大观众的新方法。
排练工作室“这是我一生中对现场音乐的最大敲门声，”伦敦国王十字区联合工作室的导演卡蒂亚·斯蒂芬森说。
经济衰退中的现场音乐通常是人们诉诸的事情。
Driift的Ric Salmon说：“不幸的是，回到世界的最后一件事将是任何规模的现场音乐。”

Yet while the business of selling music is looking healthier, the people who perform it - and those who make live music possible - are still suffering.
In the meantime, one innovative firm has found a new way of bringing live music to a mass audience.
The rehearsal studio"This is the biggest knock to live music in my lifetime," says Katya Stephenson, a director of the Joint studios in London's King's Cross area.
Live music in a recession is often the thing that people resort to.
"Unfortunately, the very last thing to come back in the world will be live music at any scale," says Ric Salmon of Driift.

在冠状病毒大流行期间，英国政府的债务支出首次超过2万亿英镑，这是因为政府为支持经济做出巨额支出。
在休假计划等措施上的支出意味着债务数字现在等于英国一年内生产的所有产品的价值。
国家统计局（ONS）表示，7月份债务总额达到2.004亿英镑，比去年同期增加2276亿英镑。
7月份的借款数字（支出与税收收入之间的差额）为267亿英镑，低于6月份修正后的295亿英镑。
Capital Economics的英国高级经济学家露丝·格里高利（Ruth Gregory）表示，7月份的借贷数字“又是一笔巨额款项，今年迄今的借贷额已达到1,505亿英镑”。

Spending on measures such as the furlough scheme means the debt figure now equals the value of everything the UK produces in a year.
Total debt hit £2.004tn in July, £227.6bn more than last year, said the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
The July borrowing figure - the difference between spending and tax income - was £26.7bn, down from a revised £29.5bn in June.
Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said July's borrowing figure was "another huge sum and pushes borrowing in the year to date to £150.5bn".
