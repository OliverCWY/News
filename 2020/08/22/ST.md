新加坡-新加坡将允许一般旅行前往文莱和新西兰，以及9月1日起在海外学习的学生。
我们的评估是，对于来自这些低风险地点的旅行者而言，无需再有留宿通知的要求，而Covid-19测试就足够了。”
如果在新加坡期间需要Covid-19的医疗，他们还将负责其医疗费用。
黄先生指出，还有其他低风险国家和地区，来自这些地区的游客可能不需要发出留在家里的通知。
在居所通知期结束之前，他们还将接受Covid-19测试。

SINGAPORE - Singapore will allow general travel to Brunei and New Zealand, as well as for students studying overseas from Sept 1.
Our assessment is that there is no need for a stay-home notice requirement for travellers from these low risk places, and a Covid-19 test will be sufficient."
They will also be responsible for their medical bills should they require medical treatment for Covid-19 while in Singapore.
Mr Wong noted that there are other low risk countries and regions, and that visitors from these areas may not need to serve a stay-home notice.
They will also be tested for Covid-19 before the end of their stay-home notice at their place of residence.

新加坡-单方面重新开放文莱和新西兰的边界是“小而谨慎”的步骤，可以使樟宜机场复苏。
他说：“航空业，樟宜机场和新加坡航空不仅与航空业本身有关，而且与整个经济联系在一起。”
“因此，我们必须真正开始采取步骤，以安全的方式开放，以复兴樟宜机场并复兴航空部门。”
它补充说，在上一个财政年度，它占了樟宜机场进出航班的一半以上。
专家指出，鉴于新加坡缺乏国内市场，新加坡航空业的复苏将更加困难。

SINGAPORE - The unilateral reopening of borders to Brunei and New Zealand is a "small, cautious" step that can resuscitate Changi Airport.
"The aviation sector, Changi Airport and Singapore Airlines do not just concern the sector itself, but are linked to the whole economy," he said.
"So we need to really start to take steps to open up in a safe manner that can revive Changi Airport and resuscitate the aviation sector."
It added that it accounted for more than half of the passengers flying in and out of Changi Airport in the last financial year.
Experts have noted that the recovery for Singapore's aviation sector will be more difficult given the lack of a domestic market here.

DeJoy试图向美国人保证，由于削减成本的措施而造成的广泛延误不会导致他们的邮件选票在11月份无法计算。
德乔伊表示，他没有与特朗普竞选活动或白宫工作人员马克·梅多斯（Mark Meadows）谈过邮政业务。
他说，邮政工人将在三天内交付95％的选举邮件，就像他们在2018年国会选举中一样。
德乔伊敦促监管机构允许邮政局提高价格，并敦促立法者降低退休成本。
众议院将于周六投票表决有关立法，该立法将提供250亿美元的邮政服务，并要求DeJoy撤销其服务变更。

DeJoy sought to assure Americans that widespread delays caused by cost-cutting measures would not cause their mail ballots to go uncounted in November.
DeJoy said he has not spoken with the Trump campaign or White House Staff Mark Meadows about postal service operations.
He said postal workers will deliver 95 per cent of election mail within three days, as they did in the 2018 congressional elections.
DeJoy urged regulators to allow the Postal Service to raise prices and pressed lawmakers to lower retirement costs.
The House is due to vote Saturday on legislation that would provide US$25 billion in Postal Service and require DeJoy to reverse his service changes.

新加坡-一名61岁的新加坡籍男子在卫生部周五（8月21日）报告的五起与Covid-19社区无关的案例中，曾在Excelsior购物中心的一家照相店SLR Revolution上班。
通过对居住在宿舍以外的建筑，海洋和加工业部门的工人进行定期例行测试，确定了其他三个不相关的社区案例：马来西亚人，印度国民和孟加拉国国民。
与社区无关的案件中还包括一名47岁的新加坡妇女。
她在星期四测试呈阳性，被发现是卫生部筛选在Covid-19一线行动中工作的人员的工作的一部分。
新加坡因Covid-19并发症导致27人死亡，而经测试呈阳性的15人死于其他原因。

SINGAPORE - A 61-year-old Singaporean man who went to work at SLR Revolution, a camera shop at Excelsior Shopping Centre, is among five unlinked Covid-19 community cases reported by the Ministry of Health on Friday (Aug 21).
Three of the other unlinked community cases - a Malaysian, an Indian national and a Bangladeshi national - were identified by rostered routine testing of workers in the construction, marine and process sectors who are living outside the dormitories.
A 47-year-old Singaporean woman was also among the unlinked community cases.
She tested positive on Thursday and was detected as part of the ministry's efforts to screen individuals working in frontline Covid-19 operations.
Singapore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 complications, while 15 who tested positive have died of other causes.

华盛顿-民主党在2016年士气低落，可能要感谢美国总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）统一其。
从民主全国代表大会（DNC）的四天中可以看出，在大流行时代，候选人在空荡荡的大厅或在自己的家中向数百万人讲话时，它具有超现实的未来主义气息：该党是比2016年更加团结。

WASHINGTON - The Democratic Party, demoralised in 2016, may have US President Donald Trump to thank for unifying it.
What was evident from four days of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) - that had a surreal futuristic ring to it in this pandemic era as candidates spoke in empty halls or in their own homes but to millions of people - is that the party is much more united than in 2016.

尽管放宽了指导方针，但周五（8月21日）在北京，仍有很大一部分人戴着口罩。
一些人说，口罩使他们感到安全，而另一些人说，戴口罩的社会压力也是一个因素。
“因为我担心人们如果看到我不戴口罩，会感到害怕，”一名24岁的北京姓曹的妇女告诉路透社。
在成功控制了首都新疆和其他地方的火炬爆发后的五天里，中国没有在大陆报告新的本地传播病例。
当局周四报告了22起在中国大陆的进口病例，并已对大多数非中国公民关闭了边境。

Despite the relaxed guidelines, a large proportion of people continued to wear masks in Beijing on Friday (Aug 21).
Some said the mask made them feel safe, while others said social pressures to wear the masks were also a factor.
Because I'm afraid that people would be scared if they see me not wearing a mask," one 24-year old Beijing woman surnamed Cao told Reuters.
China has reported no new locally transmitted cases on the mainland for five days after successfully controlling flare ups in the capital, Xinjiang and elsewhere.
The authorities reported 22 imported cases in the mainland on for Thursday, and has closed its borders to most non-Chinese citizens.

布鲁塞尔（法新社）-欧盟和英国周五（8月21日）在最新一轮脱欧后贸易谈判后缺乏进展指责，布鲁塞尔警告说达成交易似乎不太可能。
谈判结束后，巴尼尔对记者说：“那些希望本周迅速进行谈判的人会感到失望。”
弗罗斯特先生重申，他认为达成协议仍然是可能的，这是英国的目标，但他警告说：“很显然，要实现这一目标并不容易。”
下一轮会谈将于9月7日在伦敦举行，计划于10月15日至16日举行的欧盟峰会被视为交易的非正式截止日期。
一位英国高级谈判官员表示，弗罗斯特将在下一轮会谈之前的接下来几周内与巴尼尔“保持密切联系”。

BRUSSELS (AFP) - The EU and Britain on Friday (Aug 21) traded blame for the lack of progress after the latest round of post-Brexit trade talks, with Brussels warning that a deal looked unlikely.
"Those who were hoping for negotiations to move swiftly forward this week will have been disappointed," Mr Barnier told reporters after the talks ended.
Mr Frost reiterated that he thought a deal remained possible and was Britain's aim but he warned: "It is clear that it will not be easy to achieve."
The next round of talks will be held in London Sept 7, with an EU summit planned for Oct 15-16 seen as the unofficial deadline for a deal.
A senior British negotiating official said Frost would be in "close contact" with Mr Barnier over the next couple of weeks before the next round of talks.

吉隆坡-马来西亚首相穆希丁·亚辛（Muhyiddin Yassin）政党已正式加入民族团结联盟（Muafakat Nasional），组成一个庞大的马来穆斯林组织，占所有联邦议员的40％。
三个最大的马来穆斯林政党-所有前政敌都走到一起-可能意味着统治联盟之间的政治活动减少，政治也因此变得更加稳定。
由其总裁丹斯里·穆希丁（Tan Sri Muhyiddin）领导的Bersatu现在领导着一个新的统治联盟，称为民族联盟（Perikatan Nasional，简称PN）。
更糟的是，大多数Bersatu议员都从巫统叛逃。
信中说，巫统主席艾哈迈德·扎希德·哈米迪和巴勒斯坦权力机构主席阿卜杜勒·哈迪·阿旺都欢迎Bersatu加入Muafakat。

KUALA LUMPUR - The political party of Malaysia's Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin has formally joined the Muafakat Nasional alliance, to form a grand Malay Muslim organisation with some 40 per cent of all federal MPs.
The coming together of the three biggest Malay Muslim parties - all former political enemies - could mean less politicking among the ruling alliance and thus more stable politics.
Bersatu, led by its president Tan Sri Muhyiddin, now leads a new ruling alliance called Perikatan Nasional (National Alliance), or PN.
Adding to the sore, most of the Bersatu MPs had defected from Umno.
The letter said Umno's president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang both welcomed Bersatu to join Muafakat.

据著名医学杂志《柳叶刀》上的一项新研究显示，新加坡的研究人员发现了一种新的Covid-19变种，该变种引起的感染程度较轻。
研究人员说，在研究中，与没有被删除的病毒感染的患者相比，被感染了具有382个核苷酸缺失的变异体的患者具有更好的临床效果。
根据《柳叶刀》研究，三月后未检测到382变体。
他说：“在这种特殊情况下，大的（382个碱基对）缺失导致病毒的致命性降低。”
尽管突变可以使病毒更具毒性，也可以使其变弱，但变化很少。

SINGAPORE - Researchers in Singapore have discovered a new variant of Covid-19 that causes less severe infections, according to a new study in the prestigious medical journal The Lancet.
The researchers said in the study that patients infected with the variant, which has a 382 nucleotide deletion, were observed to have had better clinical outcomes relative to those infected by viruses without this deletion.
According to the Lancet study, the 382 variant was not detected after March.
"In this particular case, the large (382 base pair) deletion resulted in a virus that is less deadly," he said.
While mutations can make a virus more virulent, or it can make it less so, the changes are rarely significant.

六岁以下的儿童不需要参加大规模测试。

Unlike similar mass testing drives in the Chinese cities of Wuhan and Dalian, this is on a voluntary basis.
She expressed gratitude to China, saying that Hong Kong would not have been able to conduct mass testing on its own.
China is also bearing the cost of building a makeshift hospital in Hong Kong.
Testing samples would be discarded after tests are completed, Mr Nip said, and they would not be sent outside of Hong Kong.
Children below the age of six are not required to go for the mass testing.
