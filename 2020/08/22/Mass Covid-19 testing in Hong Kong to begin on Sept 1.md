HONG KONG (BLOOMBERG, REUTERS, XINHUA) - Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam said on Friday (Aug 21) that the city will kick off a campaign to test its entire population for coronavirus on Sept 1, in the first such effort attempted outside of mainland China.

Aided by Chinese experts and labs, the blitz will last as long as two weeks. All residents are entitled to a free, one-time test. Unlike similar mass testing drives in the Chinese cities of Wuhan and Dalian, this is on a voluntary basis.

“Hong Kong will be much better equipped to deal with the possible next virus wave now,” said Mrs Lam at a press briefing on Friday afternoon. She expressed gratitude to China, saying that Hong Kong would not have been able to conduct mass testing on its own.

The testing will be done with the assistance of a 60-person team from the mainland, the first time that Chinese health officials have assisted the special administrative region in its battle to control the pandemic.

The resource-intensive effort could help break hidden chains of transmission by detecting asymptomatic carriers, but it is unclear how many among the city’s more than 7 million people will come forward for testing.

As China tightens its grip over Hong Kong in the form of a controversial national security law, the mainland-backed testing drive could provide a gauge of mass sentiment towards growing Chinese influence.

“For yourself, for others, for public health, we hope more people can participate,” said Mrs Lam. “We’ve not set ourselves any target for total testing numbers. This test is completely voluntary.”

Hong Kong still has a relatively low number of overall cases globally. Since late January, more than 4,600 people have been infected, 75 of whom have died.

Daily cases have steadily fallen, with 27 new infections reported Friday, after the city imposed its strictest-ever social distancing measures following a resurgence of infections.

Restrictions including a ban on dining at restaurants after 6pm and the mandatory wearing of masks in all outdoor public areas are set to remain in force until at least Aug 25.

The laboratory costs for the mass testing drive will be covered by the Chinese government while Hong Kong authorities will pay for costs related to sample collection, transport and public promotion, according to Mrs Lam.

China is also bearing the cost of building a makeshift hospital in Hong Kong.

The government plans to set up various collection centres across Hong Kong’s districts, according to Secretary for the Civil Service Patrick Nip. Nasal and throat swab samples will be collected on site with the assistance of medical personnel, he said.

Testing samples would be discarded after tests are completed, Mr Nip said, and they would not be sent outside of Hong Kong. Earlier, activists in the city raised concerns that China might use such a testing blitz to collect DNA data.

An online booking system is being introduced to avoid virus spread through overcrowding. Time slots of the first week will be available online first, and the duration of the testing drive can be extended to as long as two weeks based on the demand.

Children below the age of six are not required to go for the mass testing.

Residents with a negative result will receive a text message, while those with positive results will get a call from the health bureau to arrange for hospitalisation.

Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo) will start its 2020-2021 session on Oct 14, according to the Gazette of the government on Friday.

Mrs Lam announced the date in a statement following a decision of China's top legislature earlier this month for the sixth LegCo to continue performing duties for no less than a year in a bid to address the vacancy caused by the postponement of the LegCo election.

The election for the seventh-term LegCo members, originally scheduled for Sept 6, will be put off for a year due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

Mrs Lam has said the decision of the top legislature maintains the constitutional and legal order of Hong Kong and ensures the normal governance of the government and the normal operation of society.
