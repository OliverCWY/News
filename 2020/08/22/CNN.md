（CNN）据熟悉情报的美国官员说，美国情报部门已经收集到的信息表明，中国武汉的官员一直在黑暗中将在北京的高级官员与导致Covid-19大流行的病毒保持黑暗状态长达数周之久。
官员们说，尽管美国继续收集有关在中国发生的新型冠状病毒爆发的信息，但情报包含了当地掩盖企图的无可争议的证据。
一位官员说，武汉的地方治理包括州官员和中共官员，美国情报显示，即使在党内，官员也没有与北京的同僚自由分享信息。
目前尚不清楚美国情报官员何时评估北京是否完全了解这一情况。
这位官员告诉美国有线电视新闻网：“我认为武汉官员没有向北京隐瞒它。”

(CNN) US intelligence has gathered information showing that officials in Wuhan, China, kept senior officials in Beijing in the dark for weeks about the virus that resulted in the Covid-19 pandemic, according to US officials familiar with the intelligence.
While the US continues to collect information about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China, the intelligence contains indisputable evidence of the local cover-up attempt, the officials say.
Local governance in Wuhan includes both state officials and Chinese Communist Party officials, and US intelligence shows that even within the party, officials did not freely share information with their counterparts in Beijing, one official said.
It is not clear when US intelligence officials assessed that Beijing was fully aware of the situation.
"I don't think Wuhan officials hid it from Beijing," this official told CNN.

（CNN）本周早些时候，多伦多市中心的一座清真寺的窗户被砸了，全国协会称这是三个月来针对该市伊斯兰礼拜堂的第六次破坏行为。
据加拿大穆斯林协会（MAC）称，最近一次袭击发生在8月16日在阿德莱德街的多伦多清真寺（Masjid Toronto）上。
作为MAC的一部分的多伦多清真寺（Masjid Toronto）在该市的市区有两个位置。
MAC称，在过去的三个月中，这两个地点都遭到了三次破坏。
多伦多警方在一封电子邮件中告诉美国有线电视新闻网，他们知道“两座清真寺自2020年6月1日以来遭到破坏和恶作剧的数起报道”。

(CNN) The windows of a mosque in downtown Toronto were smashed earlier this week, in what a national association says is the sixth act of vandalism in three months targeting the city's Islamic houses of worship.
The latest attack happened on August 16 at Masjid Toronto on Adelaide Street, according to the Muslim Association of Canada (MAC).
Masjid Toronto, which is part of MAC, has two locations in the city's downtown area.
Both locations have been vandalized three times in the last three months, according to MAC.
Toronto police told CNN in an email that they were aware of "several reports of damage and mischief since June 1, 2020" at the two mosques.

（CNN）-在大峡谷发现化石脚印并不罕见。
但是，一位地质学教授的发现却比他想像的要大得多：他偶然发现的是在大峡谷国家公园发现的最古老的脊椎动物化石踪迹，大约有3.13亿年的历史。
罗兰德及其同事在星期三发表在《 PLOS》杂志上的一篇论文中记录了这一发现。罗兰德在一份声明中说：“这些是迄今为止大峡谷中最古老的脊椎动物，以其丰富的化石痕迹而闻名。”
它们是地球上带壳蛋的动物（例如爬行动物）的最古老踪迹，也是脊椎动物在沙丘中行走的最早证据。”
悬崖坍塌后，露出了化石痕迹的巨石暴露了出来。

(CNN) — Finding fossil footprints at the Grand Canyon isn't particularly unusual.
But a discovery made by a geology professor turned out to be a bigger deal than he could have imagined: what he stumbled upon were the oldest vertebrate fossil tracks ever found at Grand Canyon National Park -- about 313 million years old.
Rowland and a team of colleagues documented the discovery in a paper published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One"These are by far the oldest vertebrate tracks in Grand Canyon, which is known for its abundant fossil tracks," Rowland said in a statement.
They are among the oldest tracks on Earth of shelled-egg-laying animals, such as reptiles, and the earliest evidence of vertebrate animals walking in sand dunes."
The boulder containing the fossil tracks was exposed after a cliff collapsed.

在本周散发的照片似乎显示出中国潜艇在南中国海海南岛的一个地下基地使用后，香港（CNN）的互联网上的军事观察员难得一见。
美国影像公司Planet Labs的卫星图像首次发布在Free Free Asia的社交媒体帐户上，显示的似乎是093型核动力攻击潜艇进入通往榆林海军基地地下泊位的隧道。

Hong Kong (CNN) Military watchers across the internet were provided with a rare sight after photos circulated this week that appear to show a Chinese submarine using an underground base on Hainan Island on the South China Sea.
The satellite image from American imaging company Planet Labs, first posted on the social media accounts of Radio Free Asia, shows what appears to be a Type 093 nuclear-powered attack submarine entering a tunnel to an underground berth on Yulin Naval Base.
Others made reference to the fictional Nautilus, from Jules Verne's novel "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea."
Satellite image of Aug. 18, 2020, appears to show a Chinese submarine using an underground base on Hainan Island on the South China Sea.
"That's unusual that a commercial satellite would be overhead at just the right time" on a cloudless day, he said.

英国运输部长格兰特·沙普斯（Grant Shapps）周四在西班牙度假时因改变检疫规则而陷入困境，他表示，所有旅行窗口均可能突然关闭。
事实证明，这对潜在的旅行者以及旅行和旅游部门的人们都感到沮丧。
对于英国旅客和欧洲旅游业而言，潜在的一缕阳光是英国本周取消对葡萄牙入境者的限制的举动，从本质上打开了一个新的旅行窗口。
这是否会在两国之间造成旅行的复苏尚待观察。
查尔斯补充说：“问题在于检疫措施会扼杀旅行，并有效地告诉消费者边境已经关闭。”

Grant Shapps, the UK's transport minister, who was caught out by shifting quarantine rules while vacationing in Spain, on Thursday said all travel windows were subject to sudden closure.
This has proved to be a source of frustration for both potential travelers and those in the travel and tourism sector.
One potential ray of sunshine for the UK travelers, and for Europe's tourism industry, was the UK's move this week to lift restrictions on arrivals from Portugal, essentially opening up a new travel window.
It's yet to be seen whether this will create a resurgence on travel between the two countries.
"The problem is that quarantine measures kill travel, and effectively tell consumers that borders are shut," adds Charles.

Hølmebakk告诉CNN Travel：“桥梁当然是项目的核心，它将河流和瀑布的两侧连接在一起。”
但是对于许多人来说，这座桥将成为参观Vøringsfossen瀑布的又一个理由，该瀑布已经是挪威的主要目的地之一。
人行道的设计与自然景观融为一体。

This is the dramatic Vøringsfossen waterfall bridge, a newly opened tourist attraction offering incredible views of the spectacular landscape near Eifjord in Hardanger, western Norway.
The project, designed by architect Carl-Viggo Hølmebakk , has been over a decade in the making.
"The bridge is, of course, the heart of the project, that connects two sides of the river and the waterfall together," Hølmebakk tells CNN Travel.
But for many the bridge will become yet another reason to visit Vøringsfossen waterfall, already one of Norway's top destinations.
The walkway is designed to blend in with the natural landscape.

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-当通过吸引人的飞机制服吸引公众的注意时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常是白色，但并不总是白色（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板应用了最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，合并和收购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
