More from Paris St-Germain head coach Thomas Tuchel: "It is nessecary if we want to keep the same level, we have to step up again. You have to go on. This level is necessary. We showed again we can compete with the best teams in europe with this mentality and attitude, in combination with our talent. We are a strong, strong side. We can be proud of that. We cannot worry too much because it is okay and we will go on.

Will PSG look to sign Lionel Messi? "He is very welcome\! We lost lots of players for this campaign only and we lose now Thiago Silva and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting. We need to use the transfer window now to make the squad wider. The campaign will be very demanding without any breaks. We need to build a strong, strong squad.

"We decided not to talk about transfers in this period here. We will sit together in the next days. We have many things to do to keep the level of the squad.

Pressed on Messi again: "What coach says no to Messi? I think Messi finishes his career in Barcelona. He is Mr Barcelona."
