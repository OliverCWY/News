KUALA LUMPUR - Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin's administration is set to reopen talks with Abu Dhabi to resolve disputes over the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) case, in a bid to mend strained bilateral ties.

Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein will lead a special government task force to Dubai this week, in a bid to hammer out a compromise to a legal challenge filed by Malaysia in a London court over the validity of an arbitration award that favoured state-owned entities of Abu Dhabi that had dealings with 1MDB, financial executives and lawyers close to the matter said.
