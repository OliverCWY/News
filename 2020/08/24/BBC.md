玛丽安妮·特朗普·巴里的批评言论被她的侄女玛丽·特朗普记录下来，玛丽·特朗普上个月出版了一本谴责总统的书。
听到巴里女士说：“他该死的鸣叫和说谎，哦，天哪。”
巴里女士在录音中提到了这一点，甚至暗示她记得所涉及的朋友的名字。
巴里女士一直支持她的兄弟唐纳德（Donald Donald），并且此前曾表示两人关系密切。
丹尼尔斯女士说，她已经签署协议，对自己的要求保持沉默，以在2016年10月，即总统大选前几天换取13万美元。

The critical remarks by Maryanne Trump Barry were recorded by her niece, Mary Trump, who last month published a book excoriating the president.
"His goddamned tweet and lying, oh my God," Ms Barry is heard saying.
Ms Barry refers to this in the recording, even suggesting that she remembers the name of the friend involved.
Ms Barry has been supportive of her brother Donald and has previously said the two were close.
Ms Daniels said she had signed an agreement to keep quiet about her claims in exchange for $130,000 in October 2016, days before the presidential election.

她就是律师弗兰克（JT沃尔什（JT Walsh））所称的“自私自利的bit子”-一个冷酷无情的高级心理学家，她知道她比房间里的每个人都聪明。

The Last Seduction’s journey to the screen started smoothly, says Stacy Kramer, the film’s executive in charge of development.
It was by a writer none of us had heard of, but the script was perfect, it was kind of amazing.
We were able to move forward into pre-production without a lot of pre-writing and stars came aboard immediately.
Then things got a little hairy…”The company she was working for was taken over by a businessman who wanted to pull the project.
She is what lawyer Frank (JT Walsh) calls “a self-serving bitch” – a ruthless, superior psychologist who knows she’s smarter than everyone else in the room.

克里斯·惠蒂（Chris Whitty）教授说：“儿童死于Covid-19的可能性非常小”，但缺少课程“从长远来看会损害儿童”。
惠蒂教授在访谈中强调了“压倒性的”证据，表明不上学的儿童从长远来看更可能患有精神和身体疾病。
该研究还表明，六月份上学的孩子在家中比在学校里感染冠状病毒的可能性更高。
学校工作人员有危险吗？
孩子们需要回到教室里，在那里老师最有能力照顾他们，并帮助他们取得学习所需的进步，”她说。

Prof Chris Whitty said "the chances of children dying from Covid-19 are incredibly small" - but missing lessons "damages children in the long run".
Prof Whitty used his interview to highlight "overwhelming" evidence that in not going to school, children are more likely to have "mental and physical ill health in the long run".
The study also suggested children who went to school during June were more likely to catch coronavirus at home than at school.
Are school staff at risk?
Children need to be back in the classroom where teachers are best placed to look after them and help them make the progress they need for their learning," she said.

以色列当局在特拉维夫的一个海滩上掩盖了一幅名为“偷窥汤姆斯”的壁画，以回应对另一个海滩度假村一名少女涉嫌轮奸的强烈抗议。
长期以来，妇女权利团体一直要求拆除壁画。
警方于本月对埃拉特一家旅馆涉嫌强奸一名16岁女孩的案件展开了调查。
去年，一名19岁的英国妇女声称自己在塞浦路斯的一家旅馆被12名以色列男子轮奸。
妇女权利组织谴责了此案。

Women's rights groups had long demanded the mural's removal.
Police launched an investigation this month into the alleged gang rape of a 16-year-old girl at a hotel in Eilat.
Last year, a 19-year-old British woman claimed she had been gang-raped by 12 Israeli men at a hotel in Cyprus.
The case was denounced by women's rights groups.

特朗普的行政命令禁止从9月中旬开始与TikTok的所有者ByteDance进行交易。
Bik Business记者Vivienne Nunis表示，TikTok预计该法律诉讼将于本周开始。
在11月美国总统大选之前，特朗普针对TikTok和微信采取的行动是对中国日益增长的运动中的最新行动。
代表迈克尔·比恩（Michael Bien）说：“突然中断这项措施将给人们带来灾难性的后果，尤其是在大流行中。”

Mr Trump's executive order prohibits transactions with TikTok's owner ByteDance from mid-September.
TikTok expects the legal action to begin this week, says BBC Business reporter Vivienne Nunis.
Mr Trump's actions against TikTok and WeChat are the latest in a growing campaign against China ahead of the US presidential election in November.
"Having it suddenly cut off would be disastrous and frightening for people, especially in the pandemic," said lawyer Michael Bien, who's representing those challenging President Trump's ban.

欧盟已同意取消对美国龙虾的关税，这是唐纳德·特朗普总统的主要优先事项。
特朗普先生曾威胁要提高欧盟对欧洲汽车的关税，如果欧盟不终止其龙虾关税。
作为美中贸易争端的一部分，中国对甲壳类产品加征关税，而在欧盟市场上，该行业在加拿大签署了2017年自由贸易协议后取消了对欧洲龙虾的8％关税后，对该行业失去了竞争优势。
美国新的协议将降低龙虾的关税五年，但仍需获得欧盟政府和欧洲议会的批准。
本月初，美国避免因威胁欧洲对空中客车的补贴而提高关税。

Mr Trump had threatened higher tariffs on European cars if the EU did not end the lobster duties.
China slapped tariffs on the crustacean as part of the US-China trade dispute, while in the EU market, the industry has lost ground to competitors from Canada, after the country signed a 2017 free trade agreement eliminating Europe's 8% lobster tariffs.
The new US agreement, which would drop the lobster tariffs for five years, still needs approval from EU governments and the European Parliament.
Earlier this month, the US refrained from a rise in tariffs it had threatened over European subsidies for Airbus.

然而，尽管销售音乐的业务看起来更健康，但表演音乐的人以及使现场音乐成为可能的人们仍在遭受痛苦。
同时，一家创新公司找到了一种将现场音乐带给广大观众的新方法。
排练工作室“这是我一生中对现场音乐的最大敲门声，”伦敦国王十字区联合工作室的导演卡蒂亚·斯蒂芬森说。
经济衰退中的现场音乐通常是人们诉诸的事情。
Driift的Ric Salmon说：“不幸的是，回到世界的最后一件事将是任何规模的现场音乐。”

Yet while the business of selling music is looking healthier, the people who perform it - and those who make live music possible - are still suffering.
In the meantime, one innovative firm has found a new way of bringing live music to a mass audience.
The rehearsal studio"This is the biggest knock to live music in my lifetime," says Katya Stephenson, a director of the Joint studios in London's King's Cross area.
Live music in a recession is often the thing that people resort to.
"Unfortunately, the very last thing to come back in the world will be live music at any scale," says Ric Salmon of Driift.
