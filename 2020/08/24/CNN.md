在《华盛顿邮报》透露的一场谈话中，特朗普的姐姐称他为“残酷”。
她从没想过要听到很多东西，包括总统的姐姐，联邦法官玛丽安·特朗普·巴里（Maryanne Trump Barry）指出，唐纳德·特朗普已经付钱给某人参加他的SAT考试。”
巴斯塔迪向玛丽·特朗普·巴里和唐纳德·特朗普总统转达了有关据称参加总统考试的乔·夏皮罗的问题。
周六晚上，白宫提供了唐纳德·特朗普总统的声明：“每天都有其他人在乎。
7月，在发布玛丽·特朗普的书之前，白宫在一份声明中说，国家税务总局的指控是“荒谬的”和“完全错误的”。

In one of the conversations revealed by the Post, Trump's sister called him "cruel."
She never expected to learn much of what she heard, including the President's sister, Federal Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, state that Donald Trump had paid someone to take an SAT exam for him."
Bastardi referred questions about Joe Shapiro, who allegedly took the exam for the President, to Maryanne Trump Barry and President Donald Trump.
On Saturday evening, the White House provided a statement from President Donald Trump, "Every day it's something else, who cares.
In July, prior to the release of Mary Trump's book , the White House said in a statement that the SAT allegation was "absurd" and "completely false."

在中国共产党高级培训中心和智囊团任职期间，这位直言不讳的教授以其自由主义思想和对民主改革的支持使许多人感到惊讶。
但是她作为共产党学者和顾问长达数十年的职业给她的批评以特别的重视-并给党造成了尴尬的打击。
但是蔡才华从内部观看了共产党，共产党是中国大陆唯一的执政党，对内部辩论和异议持更强硬的立场。
由内部人士转向的批评家蔡霞已被中国共产党开除。
“他们告诉我：'您首先是共产党员，之后您会成为公民。'”

During her years at the Chinese Communist Party's top training center and think tank, the outspoken professor had surprised many with her liberal ideas and support for democratic reform.
But her decades-long career as a Communist Party scholar and adviser has given her criticism a special weight -- and dealt an embarrassing blow to the Party.
But it was from the inside that Cai watched the Communist Party, which is the sole governing party within mainland China, taking a harder stance on internal debates and dissent.
Cai Xia, an insider-turned critic, has been expelled from the Chinese Communist Party.
"They told me: 'you're first a Communist Party member, and your identity as a citizen comes later.'"

The statement also said international real-world evidence suggests that schools reopening have usually not been followed by a surge of Covid-19.

## 特朗普计划从德国撤军有很多军事漏洞

波兰最高外交官说：“重要的是应将它们部署在波兰，而不是在德国。”
波兰的提振是特朗普政府计划的一部分，特朗普计划在上个月宣布从德国撤出约12,000名美军。
在冷战最激烈的时期，美国在欧洲维持了多达40万人的部队，其中大部分在德国。
主要行动包括从德国到比利时的指挥和控制中心，以及从德国到意大利的陆军空降部队和空军F-16战斗机。
Hertling指出，多年来，美国军方花费数十亿美元使德国成为欧洲的中心地带。

"It is important that they should be deployed in Poland, and not in Germany," Poland's top diplomat said.
The boost for Poland is part of a Trump administration plan to pull some 12,000 US troops from Germany announced last month.
At the height of the Cold War, the US maintained up to 400,000 troops in Europe, the majority in Germany.
Key movements include command and control centers going from Germany to Belgium as well as Army airborne troops and Air Force F-16 fighters moving from Germany to Italy.
Hertling points out the US military has spent billions over the years to make Germany its central location in Europe.

马可飓风的迫在眉睫的威胁促使周日在路易斯安那州普拉克明斯教区和路易斯安那州大岛进行了强制撤离。
“威胁生命的风暴潮”“最终，最大的担忧将是风暴潮。” CNN气象学家艾里森·钦查尔（Allison Chinchar）说。
飓风中心向沿海城市发出了风暴潮预警，从路易斯安那州的摩根城东至密西西比州的海洋温泉。
钦查尔说，预计马可将为密西西比州的比洛克西和路易斯安那州的格兰德岛带来4至6英尺的风暴潮高度。
加尔维斯顿县法官马克·亨利（Mark Henry）周日表示，马可飓风对居民而言可能不是一个因素。

The imminent threat of Hurricane Marco prompted mandatory evacuations Sunday in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, and Grand Isle, Louisiana.
'Life-threatening storm surge'"Ultimately, the big concern is going to be storm surge," CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said.
The hurricane center issued a storm surge warning for coastal cities from Morgan City, Louisiana, east to Ocean Springs, Mississippi.
Marco is expected to bring a storm surge height of 4 to 6 feet for Biloxi, Mississippi, and Grand Isle, Louisiana, Chinchar said.
Galveston County Judge Mark Henry said Sunday that Hurricane Marco would likely not be a factor for residents.

（CNN）致命的加州野火烧毁了超过100万英亩-随着成千上万名消防员奋力遏制大火并涌现更多消防员，这场战争没有尽头。
加州消防局发言人史蒂夫·考夫曼（Steve Kaufmann）说，数百起火是由闪电引发的。
他说，该州共有110万人被烧死，超过13,000名消防员在灭火。
这意味着唐纳德·特朗普总统释放了联邦援助，以补充受野火影响地区的恢复工作。
根据加州消防局（Cal Fire）的数据，去年，野火共烧焦了260,000英亩，杀死了3人。

(CNN) The deadly California wildfires have burned over 1 million acres -- and there's no end in sight as thousands of firefighters struggle to contain the blazes and more emerge.
Hundreds of fires were started by lightning, Cal Fire spokesman Steve Kaufmann said.
A total of 1.1 million have burned in the state with more than 13,000 firefighters working the fires, he said.
This means President Donald Trump released federal aid to supplement recovery efforts in areas affected by the wildfires.
Last year, wildfires charred a total of 260,000 acres and killed three people, according to Cal Fire.

（CNN）本周，法国总统和总理都在呼吁伸张正义。在涂鸦上，否认大屠杀是在本周法国格兰德河畔奥拉杜河畔的一个纪念中心发现的。
在默默尔中心（Centre de laMémoire）的墙壁上的“烈士”和“当真相”字样上涂上了“说谎者”字样，这是一个纪念中心，纪念在第二次世界大战大屠杀中死于该中心的村庄。格兰德市（Oradour-sur-Glane）市长Philippe Lacroix说，位于。
Lacroix告诉美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）附属公司BFMTV，该中心总裁于周五将这一事件告知了Lacroix。
拉克鲁瓦说，警方正在寻找负有责任的人，但对他来说显然是“支持拒绝”。
格兰德河畔奥拉杜尔村是第二次世界大战的大屠杀地点，1944年6月10日，德国军队摧毁了整个村庄，造成642人丧生。

(CNN) Both the French president and prime minister are calling for justice after graffiti denying the Holocaust was found at a memorial center in the French village of Oradour-sur-Glane this week.
"Liar" had been painted over the words "martyr" and "when the truth" on a wall at the Centere de la Mémoire, a memory center honoring those slain in the World War II massacre that took place in the village where the center is located, said Philippe Lacroix, the mayor of Oradour-sur-Glane.
The president of the center informed Lacroix of the incident on Friday, Lacroix told CNN affiliate BFMTV.
Police are searching for those responsible, Lacroix said, but it was obvious to him that it was clearly "support for a denier."
The village of Oradour-sur-Glane was the site of a massacre in World War II, when German troops destroyed the entire village on June 10, 1944, killing 642 people.

英国运输部长格兰特·沙普斯（Grant Shapps）周四在西班牙度假时因改变检疫规则而陷入困境，他表示，所有旅行窗口均可能突然关闭。
事实证明，这对潜在的旅行者以及旅行和旅游部门的人们都感到沮丧。
对于英国旅客和欧洲旅游业而言，潜在的一缕阳光是英国本周取消对葡萄牙入境者的限制，此举实质上打开了一个新的旅行窗口。
这是否会在两国之间造成旅行的复苏尚待观察。
查尔斯补充说：“问题在于检疫措施会扼杀旅行，并有效地告诉消费者边境已经关闭。”

Grant Shapps, the UK's transport minister, who was caught out by shifting quarantine rules while vacationing in Spain, on Thursday said all travel windows were subject to sudden closure.
This has proved to be a source of frustration for both potential travelers and those in the travel and tourism sector.
One potential ray of sunshine for the UK travelers, and for Europe's tourism industry, was the UK's move this week to lift restrictions on arrivals from Portugal, essentially opening up a new travel window.
It's yet to be seen whether this will create a resurgence on travel between the two countries.
"The problem is that quarantine measures kill travel, and effectively tell consumers that borders are shut," adds Charles.

The National Indian Health Board is demanding billion-dollar investments from the federal government for water and sanitation infrastructure and Indian Health Service facilities in tribal communities, among other priorities.

在总统投票的前一天，同样如此。
据美国宇航局喷气推进实验室的近地物体研究中心称，被称为2018VP1的天体预计将于11月2日接近地球。
“小行星2018VP1非常小，大约6.5英尺，对地球没有威胁。
如果它进入我们的地球大气层，它将由于其极小的体积而解体。”美国宇航局在一份声明中说。
“美国国家航空航天局受国会指示，发现90％大小大于140米（459英尺）的近地小行星，并报告了任何大小的小行星。”

On the day before the presidential vote, no less.
The celestial object known as 2018VP1 is projected to come close to Earth on November 2, according to the Center for Near Earth Objects Studies at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
"Asteroid 2018VP1 is very small, approximately 6.5 feet, and poses no threat to Earth.
If it were to enter our planet's atmosphere, it would disintegrate due to its extremely small size," NASA said in a statement.
"NASA has been directed by Congress to discover 90% of the near-Earth asteroids larger than 140 meters (459 feet) in size and reports on asteroids of any size."

在本周散发的照片似乎显示出中国潜艇在南中国海海南岛的一个地下基地上使用后，香港（CNN）的互联网上的军事观察员很少见。
美国影像公司Planet Labs的卫星图像首次发布在Free Free Asia的社交媒体帐户上，显示的似乎是093型核动力攻击潜艇进入通往榆林海军基地地下泊位的隧道。
其他人则引用了朱尔斯·凡尔纳的小说《海底两万个同盟》中的虚构的鹦鹉螺。

他说：“在无云的日子里，商业卫星会在适当的时间挂在头顶上是不寻常的。”

Hong Kong (CNN) Military watchers across the internet were provided with a rare sight after photos circulated this week that appear to show a Chinese submarine using an underground base on Hainan Island on the South China Sea.
The satellite image from American imaging company Planet Labs, first posted on the social media accounts of Radio Free Asia, shows what appears to be a Type 093 nuclear-powered attack submarine entering a tunnel to an underground berth on Yulin Naval Base.
Others made reference to the fictional Nautilus, from Jules Verne's novel "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea."
Satellite image of Aug. 18, 2020, appears to show a Chinese submarine using an underground base on Hainan Island on the South China Sea.
"That's unusual that a commercial satellite would be overhead at just the right time" on a cloudless day, he said.

Canals were dug into that same soft soil and canal walls were built.

这是一座引人注目的Vøringsfossen瀑布桥，这是一个新开放的旅游景点，在挪威西部的哈当厄尔（Hardanger）的埃菲尔峡湾（Eifjord）附近，可欣赏到壮观的风景，令人难以置信。
该项目由建筑师Carl-ViggoHølmebakk设计，已经进行了十多年。
Hølmebakk告诉CNN Travel：“桥梁当然是该项目的核心，它将河流和瀑布的两侧连接在一起。”
但是对于许多人来说，这座桥将成为参观Vøringsfossen瀑布的又一个理由，该瀑布已经是挪威的主要目的地之一。
人行道的设计与自然景观融为一体。

This is the dramatic Vøringsfossen waterfall bridge, a newly opened tourist attraction offering incredible views of the spectacular landscape near Eifjord in Hardanger, western Norway.
The project, designed by architect Carl-Viggo Hølmebakk , has been over a decade in the making.
"The bridge is, of course, the heart of the project, that connects two sides of the river and the waterfall together," Hølmebakk tells CNN Travel.
But for many the bridge will become yet another reason to visit Vøringsfossen waterfall, already one of Norway's top destinations.
The walkway is designed to blend in with the natural landscape.

While it's held on to its monopoly status as arguably the only local salad known to Singaporeans, rojak has in recent years been joined in restaurants by kerabu.

But a discovery made by a geology professor turned out to be a bigger deal than he could have imagined: what he stumbled upon were the oldest vertebrate fossil tracks ever found at Grand Canyon National Park -- about 313 million years old.
Rowland and a team of colleagues documented the discovery in a paper published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One"These are by far the oldest vertebrate tracks in Grand Canyon, which is known for its abundant fossil tracks," Rowland said in a statement.
They are among the oldest tracks on Earth of shelled-egg-laying animals, such as reptiles, and the earliest evidence of vertebrate animals walking in sand dunes."
The boulder containing the fossil tracks was exposed after a cliff collapsed.

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-当通过吸引人的飞机制服吸引公众注意时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常为白色，但并非总是如此（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板应用了最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，合并和收购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
