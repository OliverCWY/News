British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Sunday that it is "vitally important" to get children back in the classroom when schools reopen next week.

Referring to comments made earlier Sunday by Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser, Johnson said it is "far more damaging" than the virus itself for pupils to stay out of school for any longer.

It's vitally important that we get our children back into the classroom to learn and to be with their friends. Nothing will have a greater effect on the life chances of our children than returning to school," Johnson said.

The Prime Minister thanked school staff who have been making preparations for a full return in September and reiterated his previous statements about "the moral duty to reopen schools to all pupils safely."

On Sunday, the chief medical officers and deputy chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales released a statement on risks and benefits of schools and child care centers reopening.

"We are confident in the extensive evidence that there is an exceptionally small risk of children of primary or secondary school age dying from Covid-19," the statement read, adding that they are also confident that there is "clear evidence of a very low rate of severe disease in children of primary and secondary school ages compared to adults, even if they catch Covid-19."

The statement also said international real-world evidence suggests that schools reopening have usually not been followed by a surge of Covid-19.
