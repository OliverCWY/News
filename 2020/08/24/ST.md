吉隆坡-总理穆希丁·亚辛（Muhyiddin Yassin）的政府将重新与阿布扎比开始会谈，以解决有关1Malaysia Development Berhad（1MDB）案的争端，以期改善紧张的双边关系。
外交部长侯赛因·侯赛因（Heshammuddin Hussein）将于本周领导一个政府特别工作组前往迪拜，以期就马来西亚在伦敦法院就有利于阿布州国有实体的仲裁裁决的合法性提出的法律挑战做出妥协与1MDB，财务主管和律师有往来的达比说。

KUALA LUMPUR - Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin's administration is set to reopen talks with Abu Dhabi to resolve disputes over the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) case, in a bid to mend strained bilateral ties.
Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein will lead a special government task force to Dubai this week, in a bid to hammer out a compromise to a legal challenge filed by Malaysia in a London court over the validity of an arbitration award that favoured state-owned entities of Abu Dhabi that had dealings with 1MDB, financial executives and lawyers close to the matter said.

特朗普先生成为电视明星的真人秀节目《学徒》的两名制片人参与了该计划。
特朗普拥有选美权时，金先生曾担任环球小姐的法官。
特朗普上周四（8月20日）对福克斯新闻说：“我们将拥有更多的生活空间。”
特朗普先生已经取消了这种模式，并计划在公约的四个晚上中的每个黄金时间都在黄金时段直接向美国讲话。
特朗普的助手说，正在使用的白宫场所被视为住所的一部分，因此被授权用于政治用途。

Two producers of The Apprentice, the reality show where Mr Trump rose to TV stardom, are involved in the planning.
Mr Kim once served as a Miss Universe judge when Mr Trump owned the pageant.
"We're going to have more of it live than what they did," Mr Trump told Fox News last Thursday (Aug 20).
Mr Trump has dismissed that model and plans to directly address the nation in prime time on each of the convention's four nights.
Trump aides said that the White House venues being used are considered part of the residence and therefore are authorised for political use.

利马（路透社）-秘鲁政府官员谴责了一家夜总会的老板，因为参加聚会的人因违反冠状病毒限制逃离警察搜捕的政党，导致至少13人被压死或窒息。
官员说，人们陷入了唯一的入口门和通往街道的楼梯之间。
秘鲁女部长罗萨里奥·萨西塔女士（Rosario Sasieta）要求对组织此次活动的俱乐部管理层处以严厉的处罚。
Thomas Restobar的所有者或经理无法立即发表评论。
截至周六，秘鲁共记录了585,236例冠状病毒病例，是7月2日报告数量的两倍，而已知死亡人数已上升至27,453。

LIMA (REUTERS) - Peruvian government officials condemned the owner of a nightclub after at least 13 people were crushed to death or asphyxiated as partygoers tried to flee a party raided by police because it violated coronavirus restrictions.
People became trapped between the only entrance door and a staircase leading to the street, officials said.
Peru’s women’s minister, Ms Rosario Sasieta, called for harsh penalties for the club’s management who organised the event.
The owner or managers of Thomas Restobar were not immediately available to comment.
Peru had recorded a total of 585,236 coronavirus cases as of Saturday, double the number reported on July 2, while the known death toll has risen to 27,453.

如果卡玛拉·哈里斯（Kamala Harris）女士获得美国副总统并随后前往新加坡旅行，那么这里的领导层应该有时会喜欢在公共场所计划一顿饭，这很容易做到：在Madras New Woodlands的thosai在上迪克森路（Upper Dickson Road）提供出色的视觉效果。
同样，在莫顿的牛排晚餐就可以了。
这些都是哈里斯女士跨越的世界，哈里斯女士来自加利福尼亚，是美国最富有的州的前司法部长，是美国移民的牙买加裔父亲和泰米尔印度裔母亲的孩子。

If ever Ms Kamala Harris gains the vice-presidency of the United States and makes a trip to Singapore thereafter, the leadership here should have little difficulty planning a meal at a public venue, as it sometimes likes to do: A thosai at Madras New Woodlands in Upper Dickson Road would make for great visuals.
Equally, a steak dinner at Morton's will do just fine.
These are the worlds straddled by Ms Harris, the junior senator from California and former attorney-general of America's richest state who is the child of a Jamaican-born father and a Tamil Indian mother, both US immigrants.

华盛顿（纽约时报）-唐纳德·特朗普总统的姐姐，曾任联邦法官的玛丽安·特朗普·巴里在2018年和2019年的侄女玛丽·特朗普的一系列录音中将他描述为“没有原则”的骗子。

伦敦（法新社）-伦敦的标志性塔桥在上周六（8月22日）升起以让船只通过时遭受了“技术问题”，但无法关闭。
桥梁在下午和晚上关闭了几个小时的车辆之后，该地区的交通陷入僵局。
塔桥在推特上说：“该桥今天下午遇到了技术问题，并被锁定在升高的位置一段时间。”
这座桥建于1886年至1894年之间，每年举升约800次，并计划在周六为历史悠久的租赁船Sailing Barge Will升起。
一个多小时后，它重新向行人开放，但对车辆关闭了几个小时。

LONDON (AFP) - London's iconic Tower Bridge suffered "technical issues" on Saturday (Aug 22) when it was raised to let a ship through - and was unable to close.
Traffic around the area became deadlocked after the bridge was closed to vehicles for several hours during the afternoon and evening.
"The bridge experienced technical issues this afternoon and was locked in a raised position for a period of time," Tower Bridge said on its Twitter feed.
Built between 1886 and 1894, the bridge lifts around 800 times a year, and on Saturday was scheduled to be raised for the historic charter boat Sailing Barge Will.
It reopened to pedestrians more than an hour later, but remained shut to vehicles for several hours.

日内瓦（法新社）-世界卫生组织（星期五）（8月21日）建议12岁以上的儿童在与成人相同的环境下戴口罩，以遏制Covid-19大流行。
联合国卫生机构与联合国儿童基金会（UNICEF）合作，于周五发布了新的指南，指导儿童何时戴口罩以阻止冠状病毒危机的蔓延。
但是它说，尽管有很少的证据表明，与成年人相比，年幼的儿童对感染的敏感性较低，但数据表明，青少年“可能比年幼的儿童在传播中起更积极的作用”。
联合国机构说，五岁以下的孩子不应该戴口罩。
但是，对于此类幼儿，应有一名成年人在场，以监督他们正在安全地使用口罩，并应考虑对其学习和发育的潜在影响。

GENEVA (AFP) - The World Health Organisation on Friday (Aug 21) recommended that children over 12 should wear masks in the same contexts as adults in the bid to rein in the Covid-19 pandemic.
The UN health agency, in cooperation with Unicef, published fresh guidance Friday on when it is appropriate for children to wear masks to impede the spread of the coronavirus crisis.
But it said that while there is some limited evidence that young children may have lower susceptibility to infection compared to adults, data indicated that teenagers "may play a more active role in transmission than younger children".
The UN agencies said that children under five should not wear a mask.
For such young children, though, an adult should be present to supervise that they are using the mask safely, and the potential impact on their learning and development should be taken into consideration.

BANGKOK (NYTIMES) - In just four days, the reputation of a Buddhist monk who had spent decades fighting for the human rights of Cambodians was destroyed.
First, grainy videos appeared on a fake Facebook page, claiming that he had slept with three sisters and their mother.
Then a government-controlled religious council defrocked the monk for having violated Buddhist precepts of celibacy.

To supplement the household expenses, she bakes cakes to sell online," said Mr Chow.

汉城（路透社）-韩国当局报告说，自3月初（8月23日）以来，日间新型冠状病毒病例的日增幅最高，他表示，由于首尔教堂和其他聚会场所的暴发继续蔓延，可能需要更严格的社会疏散规则。
报告说，这使韩国新的冠状病毒感染总数达到了17,399例，导致309名COVID-19死亡。
上周五，卫生当局表示，韩国的冠状病毒感染已“全面展开”，原因是数百名感染已经从一位极右翼传教士经营的萨朗耶尔长老会教堂开始散发。
荣格说，到目前为止，共有841例确诊病例与教堂有关。

SEOUL (REUTERS) - South Korean authorities reported the highest daily rise in novel coronavirus cases since early March on Sunday (Aug 23), saying tougher social distancing rules might be needed as outbreaks continued to spread from a Seoul church and other gatherings.
That brings South Korea’s total infections of the new coronavirus to 17,399 with 309 COVID-19 deaths, it said.
On Friday, health authorities said South Korea’s coronavirus infections were back “in full swing” as hundreds of infections have started to come out from the Sarang Jeil Presbyterian Church run by a far-right preacher.
Jung said a total of 841 confirmed cases were related to the church so far.
Members of the church attending an anti-government protest in Seoul on Aug 15 have also led to new cases across the country, while another recent cluster has been linked to a Starbucks store.
