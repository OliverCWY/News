伦敦（CNN）即使按照全球领导人进行大流行的标准，鲍里斯·约翰逊也经历了动荡的2020年。
约翰逊说，在几个月的骚乱之后，所有儿童重返学校“至关重要”。
该声明在英国媒体中被广泛解释为试图证明约翰逊在事情上已处于控制之中。
约翰逊完全有可能在今年结束他的英国脱欧交易，而这个国家正处于摆脱大流行的高潮之中。
福特说：“病毒激增，英国退欧谈判进展不佳，学校和大学不得不关闭，所有这些因素加在一起将为政府制造一场龙卷风。”

London (CNN) Even by the standards of a world leader navigating a pandemic, Boris Johnson has had a tumultuous 2020.
It is "vitally important" for all children to return to school after months of disruption, Johnson said.
The statement was widely interpreted in the British media as an attempt to demonstrate that Johnson was getting a grip on matters.
It is entirely possible that Johnson ends the year with his Brexit deal and the country on its way out of the pandemic, head held high.
"A spike in the virus, Brexit talks going badly, schools and universities having to shutdown, all of these things combined would create a tornado for the government," said Ford.

（CNN）根据初步研究，今年住在香港的一名33岁男子两次出现Covid-19。
香港大学团队周一报告说，他第一次有症状，但第二次没有明显症状。
研究人员说，然后在他的第二次发作中，该患者从英国经西班牙回国返回香港，他在8月15日于香港机场进行的入场筛查中呈阳性反应。
他们写道：“以前感染过COVID-19的患者也应遵守流行病学控制措施，例如全面掩蔽和远离社会。”

(CNN) A 33-year-old man living in Hong Kong had Covid-19 twice this year, according to preliminary research.
He had symptoms the first time around, but no obvious symptoms the second time, the team at the University of Hong Kong reported Monday.
Then during his second episode, the patient was returning to Hong Kong from traveling in Spain via the United Kingdom, and he tested positive during his entry screening at the Hong Kong airport on August 15, the researchers said.
"Patients with previous COVID-19 infection should also comply with epidemiological control measures such as universal masking and social distancing," they wrote.
"The report from Hong Kong of a re-infection in a man by COVID-19 that was genetically different from the first infection should not be too surprising.

研究人员花了两年时间才获得合适的结果，他们能够通过在两个钻石砧之间挤压激光加热的铁样品（地球的核心主要由铁制成）来重现这些条件。
研究人员说，研究人员估计地球的核心年龄在1到13亿年之间，处于以前认为的光谱的低端。
研究人员说，以前估计地球的核心年龄在1.3到45亿年之间，而最近的一项估计甚至更低，为5.65亿年。
实验还为研究人员提供了一个更清晰的图景，即核心如何传导热量以及为地球地球发电机供电的能源。
这也表明内芯的形成在产生地球磁场中起着关键作用。

It took the researchers two years to attain suitable results, and they were able to recreate these conditions by squeezing laser-heated samples of iron -- the Earth's core is made primarily of iron -- between two diamond anvils.
The researchers estimate that the Earth's core is between 1 to 1.3 billion years old, which is on the lower end of the spectrum of what was previously believed, the researchers said .
The Earth's core was previously estimated to be between 1.3 to 4.5 billion years old, with one recent estimate putting it even lower at 565 million years, according to the researchers.
The experiments also give the researchers a clearer picture of how the core conducts heat and the energy sources that power the Earth's geodynamo.
It also suggests that the formation of the inner core played a pivotal role in creating Earth's magnetic fields.

（CNN）纽约州检察长要求法院强迫埃里克·特朗普在对特朗普组织的调查中被罢免。
周一在法庭文件中，莱蒂蒂亚·詹姆斯的办公室说，埃里克·特朗普最初同意在7月22日参加宣誓就职，但拒绝了，“在协议安排他作证前不到两天就退缩了。
詹姆斯的办公室概述了特朗普组织是否“不当地夸大了特朗普先生在财务报表上的资产的价值，以获取贷款并获得经济和税收利益的调查范围”。
自2019年以来，总检察长办公室一直在调查唐纳德·特朗普总统和特朗普组织，当时特朗普的前检察长迈克尔·科恩在国会作证说，特朗普的年度财务报表夸大了他的资产价值，以确保获得有利的贷款和保险，但使其他资产的价值，以减少房地产税。
詹姆斯办公室在文件中说，埃里克·特朗普的检察官给司法部长写了一封信，称他将援引“宪法赋予每个人的那些权利”作为不作证的理由。

(CNN) The New York state attorney general is asking for a court to compel Eric Trump to be deposed in an investigation of the Trump Organization.
In court filings Monday, Letitia James' office said Eric Trump initially agreed to sit for a deposition on July 22, only to refuse, "balking less than two days before he was scheduled by agreement to give testimony."
James' office outlined the scope of the investigation into whether the Trump Organization "improperly inflated the value of Mr. Trump's assets on financial statements in order to secure loans and obtain economic and tax benefits."
The attorney general's office has been investigating President Donald Trump and the Trump Organization since 2019, when Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen testified before Congress that Trump's annual financial statements inflated the values of his assets in order to secure favorable loans and insurance coverage, but deflated the value of other assets in order to reduce real estate taxes.
In the filing, James' office states Eric Trump's attorney sent a letter to the attorney general saying he would invoke "those rights afforded to every individual under the Constitution" as justification not to testify.

（CNN）根据周一发表的全球最新研究，与海拔较低的孩子相比，出生在海拔5,000英尺或以上的孩子通常较小，并且更容易发育迟缓。
研究发现，即使孩子出生在被定义为拥有良好健康状况，较高的生活条件和受过良好教育的母亲的“理想家庭环境”中，这也意味着发育迟缓不太可能是由于诸如贫穷等常见的危险因素造成的。饮食和疾病。
研究发现，随着海拔的升高，生长下降。生活在理想家庭环境中的儿童以世界卫生组织认为的标准速度增长，直到他们生活在海拔500米（1650英尺）左右。
在那个高度或更高的高度，儿童的年龄高度得分开始下降。
根据周一在《美国医学会杂志》（JAMA PediatricsRead）上发表的研究，在海拔1,500米（约5,000英尺）的水平上，与生活在海拔较低的城市中的儿童相比，孩子“出生的长度较短，并且处于较低的生长轨迹”。更多

(CNN) Children born at 5,000 feet or more above sea level are typically smaller at birth and more likely to remain stunted than those born at lower altitudes, according to new worldwide research published Monday.
This was true even if the children were born into "ideal-home environments" defined as having good health coverage, higher living conditions and highly educated mothers, the study found, which meant stunting was unlikely to be due to common risk factors such as poor diet and disease.
Growth declined as altitude grewChildren living in ideal home environments grew at rates deemed standard by the World Health Organization until they lived at around 500 meters (1,650 feet) above sea level, the study found.
At that altitude and higher, children's height-for-age scores began to decrease.
At levels of 1,500 meters, or approximately 5,000 feet, above sea level, children were "born at shorter length and remained on a lower growth trajectory" than children who lived in cities at lower sea levels, according to the study published Monday in JAMA PediatricsRead More

(CNN) — Even before the coronavirus pandemic ignited global conversations about hygiene, there was one part of an airplane that nobody wanted to touch -- the bathroom door.
That's why Japanese airline ANA is testing a new hands-free bathroom door that passengers can open with their elbow or forearm (see above pic).
Lavatory doors open inward (less aisle blockage) or have small, flat handles instead of doorknobs.
Inside the bathroom, the locking mechanism looks pretty familiar, with a button you slide from one side to the other.
Currently, the door prototype is only available in ANA's lounge at Tokyo's Haneda Airport , where the company is gathering feedback on it through the end of August.

但是，罗马太空望远镜的能力将使它能够发现并表征这些漫游的游牧行星。
“罗马将通过研究流氓行星来帮助我们更多地了解我们如何适应宇宙的事物。
它也有能力找到小到火星的流氓行星，火星的大小略大于地球的一半。

The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, NASA's upcoming observatory expected to launch in the mid-2020s, could reveal a multitude of rogue planets that don't orbit stars in our Milky Way galaxy, according to new research.

But the Roman Space Telescope's capabilities will allow it to find and characterize these roaming nomad planets.
"Roman will help us learn more about how we fit in the cosmic scheme of things by studying rogue planets.
It also has the ability to find rogue planets as small as Mars, which is slightly bigger than half the size of Earth.

在这个范围的高端，该公司的价值约为92亿美元。

Hong Kong (CNN Business) Xpeng Motors, a Chinese electric automaker backed by Alibaba, is heading to the New York Stock Exchange, where it hopes to raise up to $1.1 billion — even as relations between Beijing and Washington continue to worsen.
The company has applied for an initial public offering and plans to sell 85 million American Depositary Shares, with each representing two ordinary shares in Xpeng.
It aims to price its stock between $11 and $13 per share, according to a regulatory filing on Friday.
At the top end of that range, the company would be valued at roughly $9.2 billion.
The IPO is notable considering how much scrutiny Chinese firms that trade in the United States are facing from regulators there.

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-当通过吸引人的飞机制服吸引公众注意时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常为白色，但并非总是如此（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板可以应用最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，合并和收购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
