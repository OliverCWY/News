(CNN) Children born at 5,000 feet or more above sea level are typically smaller at birth and more likely to remain stunted than those born at lower altitudes, according to new worldwide research published Monday.

This was true even if the children were born into "ideal-home environments" defined as having good health coverage, higher living conditions and highly educated mothers, the study found, which meant stunting was unlikely to be due to common risk factors such as poor diet and disease.

Growth declined as altitude grew

Children living in ideal home environments grew at rates deemed standard by the World Health Organization until they lived at around 500 meters (1,650 feet) above sea level, the study found. At that altitude and higher, children's height-for-age scores began to decrease.

At levels of 1,500 meters, or approximately 5,000 feet, above sea level, children were "born at shorter length and remained on a lower growth trajectory" than children who lived in cities at lower sea levels, according to the study published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics
