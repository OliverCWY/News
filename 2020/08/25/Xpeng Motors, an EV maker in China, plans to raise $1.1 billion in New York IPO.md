Hong Kong (CNN Business) Xpeng Motors, a Chinese electric automaker backed by Alibaba, is heading to the New York Stock Exchange, where it hopes to raise up to $1.1 billion — even as relations between Beijing and Washington continue to worsen.

The company has applied for an initial public offering and plans to sell 85 million American Depositary Shares, with each representing two ordinary shares in Xpeng.

It aims to price its stock between $11 and $13 per share, according to a regulatory filing on Friday. At the top end of that range, the company would be valued at roughly $9.2 billion.

The IPO is notable considering how much scrutiny Chinese firms that trade in the United States are facing from regulators there. Earlier this month, for example, an advisory council run by US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin recommended that regulators require much greater access to the accounts of Chinese firms wishing to join US stock exchanges.
