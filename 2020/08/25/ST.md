日内瓦/伦敦（路透社）-世界卫生组织周一（8月24日）表示，约有172个国家正在使用旨在确保公平获得Covid-19疫苗的Covax设施，但仍需要更多资金，并且各国现在需要具有约束力的承诺。
“ Covax设施的成功不仅取决于签署该协定的国家，还取决于填补主要的资金缺口。”
它目前涵盖9种候选Covid-19疫苗，其目标是在2021年底之前签署的国家中确保供应和提供20亿剂疫苗。
特德罗斯博士说：“起初，当（Covid-19疫苗）供应有限时，向全球最高风险人群提供疫苗很重要。”

GENEVA/LONDON (REUTERS) - Some 172 countries are engaging with the Covax facility designed to ensure equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines, the World Health Organization said on Monday (Aug 24), but more funding is needed and countries need now to make binding commitments.
"The success of the Covax facility hinges not only on countries signing up to it, but also filling key funding gaps."
It currently covers nine candidate Covid-19 vaccines and its aim is to secure supplies of and deliver two billion doses across countries that sign up by the end of 2021.
"Initially, when there will be limited supply (of Covid-19 vaccines), it's important to provide the vaccine to those at highest risk around the globe," Dr Tedros said.

阿德恩女士在电视新闻发布会上说：“我们希望每个人都充满信心和确定性。”
奥克兰禁闭行动定于8月11日进行，此前官方已检测到该国在三个多月内首次在本地获得Covid-19病例，该禁飞原定于周三结束。
阿登女士说，该市将从3级降级到2级的限制将从周一开始逐步实施。
这意味着尾巴会很长，案件还会持续一会儿。”阿登女士在惠灵顿告诉记者。
新西兰有500万人口，迄今已记录了1,300多例Covid-19病例，其中22例死亡。

"We want both confidence, and certainty for everyone," Ms Ardern said during a televised media conference.
The Auckland lockdown, imposed on Aug 11 after officials detected the country’s first locally acquired cases of Covid-19 in more than three months, had been scheduled to end on Wednesday.
The city’s step down from Level 3 to Level 2 restrictions will be made gradually from Monday, Ms Ardern said.
And that means the tail will be long, and the cases will keep coming for a while to come," Ms Ardern told reporters in Wellington.
New Zealand, which has a population of 5 million, has so far recorded just over 1,300 Covid-19 cases, including 22 deaths.

卫生部长阿达姆·巴巴（Adham Baba）说，卫生部提议限制措施应继续下去，直到“情况得到进一步控制”为止。
他说，但是，由理事会和总理穆希丁·亚辛决定是否延长控制令。
他在周日（8月23日）在古来举行的活动后说：“这取决于总理，因为总理将在8月31日恢复MCO时期结束时宣布这一决定。”
他正在回答有关政府是否将延长恢复MCO期限的问题，因为该期限将在大约一周后结束。
在6月开始的MCO复苏下，大多数企业和学校被允许重新开放，但是大型聚会，海外旅行和联系和观众体育仍然被禁止。

Health Minister Adham Baba said the ministry had proposed that the restrictions should continue until the "situation was more under control".
However it was up to the council and Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin to decide whether to extend the control order, he said.
"It depends on the Prime Minister, who will announce it (the decision) as the Aug 31 recovery MCO period is coming to an end, " he said after launching an event in Kulai on Sunday (Aug 23).
He was responding to a question on whether the government would extend the recovery MCO period as it was due to end in about a week.
Most businesses and schools have been allowed to reopen under the recovery MCO which began in June, however large gatherings, overseas travel and contact and spectator sports remain banned.

菲律宾国防部长说，中国所谓的“九点划线”曾经是在捏造南中国海的大部分地区，当时他指责北京非法占领了菲律宾的海域。
他们的（中国）所谓的历史权利在他们的9条线所围成的区域中不存在，只是在他们的想象中。
“他们（中国）是通过非法占据我们专属经济区内的某些地区而进行挑衅的人。
哈里·罗克（Harry Roque）周五说：“如果我们认为我们的主权受到侵犯，我们的外交官通常会提出抗议。”
杜特尔特当时的发言人说，中国国家主席习近平去年在北京对杜特尔特先生表示，其在海上的立场尚待谈判。

MANILA (AFP) - China's "nine-dash line" used to claim most of the South China Sea is a fabrication, the Philippine defence minister said, as he accused Beijing of illegally occupying the Philippines' maritime territory.
"Their (China's) so-called historical rights over an area enclosed by their nine-line doesn't exist except in their imaginations.
"They (China) are the ones who have been doing provocations by illegally occupying some features within our EEZ.
"Our diplomats routinely lodge protests like that if we believe our sovereign rights are violated," Mr Harry Roque said on Friday.
Chinese President Xi Jinping told Mr Duterte in Beijing last year that its position on the sea was not up for negotiation, a spokesman for Mr Duterte said at the time.

新德里-印度主要反对党代表大会在星期一（8月24日）陷入动荡，因为领导力危机在该党的最新挫折中席卷全球，该党正为争取政治生存和相关性而进行艰苦的战斗。
最高决策机构国会工作委员会（CWC）举行了马拉松会议，此前有23位党的领导人致信寻求内部变革，包括“全职和可见”领导。
这次会议似乎已经盖过了领导层的危机，大多数国会领导人都聚集在甘地家族周围，并对他们的领导层表示信任。
尽管如此，人们仍以这种工作方式来挫败一些党的高级领导人，因为他担心他拒绝让高级领导人充满信心。
他说：“我不认为非家族领导人准备好要硬着头皮，部分原因是（甘地）领导层周围的阴谋集团。

NEW DELHI - India's main opposition Congress was thrown into turmoil on Monday (Aug 24) as a leadership crisis spilled out into the open in the latest setback for the party, which is fighting an uphill battle for political survival and relevance.
A marathon meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the top decision-making body, was held after a letter from 23 party leaders sought internal changes including a "full-time and visible" leadership.
The meeting appeared to have put a lid on the crisis of leadership for now, with most Congress leaders rallying around the Gandhi family and expressing faith in their leadership.
Still, this style of functioning is seen to have rubbed some senior party leaders the wrong way amid concerns that he resisted taking senior leaders into confidence.
"I don't think the non-family leadership is ready to bite the bullet partly because of the cabal around the (Gandhi) leadership.

Najib did not elaborate on his plans but said his priority was to be the "voice of the people".

Al Noor清真寺的阿am（Gamm Fouda）告诉塔兰特（Tarrant）他“被误导和误导了”，他的仇恨是不必要的。
霍斯先生说，塔兰特还对没有再度丧生表示遗憾，并透露他打算在枪击事件发生后烧毁诺尔清真寺。
霍斯先生说：“他打算向那些被他称为侵略者的人灌输恐惧，其中包括穆斯林人口或更普遍的非欧洲移民。”
霍斯先生说，塔兰特向执着父亲腿的三岁孩子穆卡德·易卜拉欣开了“两枪”。
塔兰特的大多数受害者都在Al Noor清真寺时，他袭击了第二座清真寺，然后被拘留到第三座清真寺。

Mr Gamal Fouda, imam of Al Noor mosque, told Tarrant that he was "misguided and misled" and that his hatred was unnecessary.
Tarrant had also expressed regret for not taking more lives and revealed that he had intended to burn down the Al Noor mosque after the shootings, Mr Hawes said.
"He intended to instil fear into those he described as invaders, including the Muslim population or more generally non-European immigrants," Mr Hawes said.
Tarrant fired "two precisely aimed shots" at three-year-old Mucaad Ibrahim who was clinging to his father’s leg, Mr Hawes said.
While most of Tarrant's victims were at Al Noor mosque, he attacked a second mosque before being detained en route to a third.

马尼拉-星期一（8月24日），两次爆炸袭击了菲律宾南部饱受叛乱困扰的乔洛镇，造成至少15人丧生，其中包括一名涉嫌自杀炸弹手。
目标似乎是一辆停在乔洛市广场附近商业大楼前的军用卡车。
Vinluan少将说，星期一的袭击可能是大教堂爆炸案背后的阿布沙耶夫极端组织的同一派系的工作。
他将阿布沙耶夫（Abu Sayyaf）酋长哈蒂布·萨瓦贾恩（Hatib Sawadjaan）的侄子蒙迪·萨瓦贾恩（Mundi Sawadjaan）标记为最近一次袭击的主要嫌疑人。
周一的袭击发生是在另一名阿布沙耶夫酋长安杜吉汉·苏苏坎（Anduljihan Susukan）通过摩洛民族解放阵线领导人努尔·米苏阿里（Nur Misuari）的代祷而被捕之后的几周。

MANILA - Two explosions rocked the insurgency-plagued town of Jolo in the southern Philippines on Monday (Aug 24), killing at least 15 people, including a suspected suicide bomber.
The target seemed to have been a military truck parked in front of a commercial building near the Jolo town plaza.
Maj-Gen Vinluan said Monday’s attacks could be the work of the same faction of the Abu Sayyaf extremist group behind the cathedral bombings.
He tagged Mundi Sawadjaan, nephew of Abu Sayyaf chieftain Hatib Sawadjaan, as the main suspect in the latest attacks.
Monday’s attacks come just weeks after the arrest of another Abu Sayyaf chieftain, Anduljihan Susukan, through the intercession of Moro National Liberation Front leader Nur Misuari.
