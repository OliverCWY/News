有一个明显的问题...共和党全国代表大会是什么？
共和党全国代表大会今年将如何运作？
特朗普先生还为自己的行为辩护，两人此前曾出现在虚拟的特朗普竞选活动中。
除了特朗普本人之外，头条人物将是周二的第一夫人梅拉尼娅·特朗普，其次是周三的副总统迈克·彭斯。
他以自己的形象重塑了共和党，着重强调保守的民粹主义，有时甚至是野蛮的言论。

There's an obvious question...What is the Republican National Convention?
How will the Republican National Convention work this year?
Mr Trump has also defended their actions and the pair have previously appeared at a virtual Trump campaign event.
The headliners, apart from Mr Trump himself, will be First Lady Melania Trump on Tuesday, followed by Vice-President Mike Pence on Wednesday.
He's remade the Republican Party in his image, with an emphasis on conservative populism and sometimes brash rhetoric.

中国视频共享应用TikTok已向美国总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）施加禁令提起诉讼。
蒂克托克说，特朗普政府的这一举动是出于政治动机，而不是国家安全。
蒂克托克在诉讼中表示，为回应华盛顿的担忧，它已采取“非常”措施保护美国数据，并辩称该命令是对国家安全法的滥用。
特朗普先生表示，如果中国的ByteDance将其出售给美国公司，TikTok可以继续运营。
特朗普总统说，中国公司开发和拥有的移动应用程序的增长“增强了国家安全，外交政策和美国经济”。

Tiktok said the Trump administration's move was motivated by politics, not national security.
In its lawsuit, Tiktok said it had taken "extraordinary" steps to safeguard US data in response to Washington's concerns and argued that the order is a misuse of national security law.
Mr Trump has said TikTok can continue to operate, if China's ByteDance sells it to a US company.
The growth of mobile apps developed and owned by Chinese firms "threatens the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the US", said President Trump.

采矿巨头前后的Juukan Gorge洞穴遗址采矿业巨头力拓（Rio Tinto）削减了三名高管的奖金，原因是他们破坏了澳大利亚的两个古老洞穴。
今年5月，全球最大的铁矿石开采商摧毁了西澳大利亚州皮尔巴拉（Pilbara）的神圣原住民遗址。
尽管原住民传统所有者表示反对，该公司仍继续摧毁Juukan Gorge岩石庇护所。
力拓董事长西蒙·汤普森说：“很明显，没有个人或失误造成了朱坎岩棚的破坏。”
审查发现，尽管该公司已获得爆炸的法律授权，但该决定仍未达到力拓自身设定的标准和内部指导。

In May, the world's biggest iron ore miner destroyed the sacred Aboriginal sites in Pilbara, Western Australia.
The company went ahead with the destruction of the Juukan Gorge rock shelters despite the opposition of Aboriginal traditional owners.
"It is clear that no single individual or error was responsible for the destruction of the Juukan rockshelters," said Rio Tinto chairman Simon Thompson.
The review found that while the company had obtained legal authority for the blasts, the decision fell short of the standards and internal guidance Rio Tinto had set for itself.

亿万富翁商人迈克·阿什利（Mike Ashley）入主他的竞争对手兼长期评论家戴夫·惠兰（Dave Whelan），成为他们的管理者。
Hargreaves Lansdown的高级市场分析师Susannah Streeter表示，该集团收购了一家体育用品公司感到惊讶，因为他们仍在“为公众的不愿在室内训练而苦恼”。
DW还拥有Fitness First健身连锁店，该连锁店不受政府部门的影响。
据报道，2000年，惠兰先生告诉南方的年轻竞争对手：“儿子，北方有一家俱乐部，您不属于其中。”
它已经关闭了2018年从管理部门收购的59家商店中的10家。

Susannah Streeter, senior markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was surprising the group had bought a gym business as they were still "grappling with the public's reluctance to train indoors".
DW also owns the Fitness First gym chain which is unaffected by the administration.
In 2000, Mr Whelan was famously reported to have told his younger rival from the south: "There is a club in the north, son, and you're not part of it."
It has already shut 10 of the 59 stores it bought out of administration in 2018.

英国旅游业已达到“关键点”，并呼吁提供进一步支持以防止失业。
旅游行业贸易机构ABTA表示，遏制这种大流行的措施已经导致大约39,000个工作岗位流失。
大约65％的旅行社不得不裁员或开始咨询程序。
ABTA表示，锁定之后许多旅行社尚未重启，游轮公司和学校旅行社仍关闭营业。
越来越多的旅行社可能破产。

Image copyright AFPThe UK's travel industry has reached a "critical point" and is calling for further support to stem job losses.
Measures to curb the pandemic have already led to the loss of around 39,000 jobs, said travel industry trade body ABTA.
About 65% of travel firms have had to make redundancies or start a consultation process.
ABTA said many travel firms had not yet restarted after the lockdown, with cruise firms and school travel operators still closed for business.
More travel firms could go bust"We have already seen well-known and respected businesses that would normally be successful falling into administration, and more are sadly set to follow," said Mr Tanzer.
