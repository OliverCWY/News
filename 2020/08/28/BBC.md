盖蒂图片社（Getty Images）版权所有：盖蒂图片社（NBA）球员抵制昨天的季后赛比赛的决定是前所未有的团结一致的表现-蔓延到女子NBA，美国职业棒球大联盟和美国职业足球。
但是，当被问及周四的抗议活动时，唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）拒绝了。
在三年前的一次政治集会上，特朗普表示，卡佩尼克和其他类似他的人应该被他们的团队开除。
那是对联盟进攻数月的开始，一直持续到第二年的中期选举。
特朗普下次在他的一个（较小的）集会人群中面前时，所有的赌注都消失了。

Getty Images Copyright: Getty ImagesThe decision by NBA players to boycott yesterday’s playoff games was an unprecedented show of solidarity – one that spread to the Women’s NBA, Major League Baseball and US professional soccer.
When asked about the protest on Thursday, however, Donald Trump brushed it off.
At a political rally three years ago, Trump said Kaepernick and others like him should be fired by their teams.
That was the start of months of attacks on the league that continued through to the mid-term elections the following year.
The next time Trump is in front of one of his (smaller) rally crowds, however, all bets are off.

曼德法官在判处无假释的无期徒刑时说：“如果不在这里，什么时候？”
曼德法官说，这种无假释的无期徒刑仅适用于“非常严重的谋杀案”。
在为期四天的宣判听证会的最后一天，曼德法官花了将近一个小时的时间来提醒塔兰特他被杀害和受伤的每个人。
塔兰特通过法庭上的律师表示，他不反对检方提出的无假释判决的申请，他对此判决没有任何反应。
但是他们已经伸张正义，给了他最长的假释时间。”现年34岁的希娜·埃米尔说。他在塔兰特发动袭击时不在努尔清真寺附近。

On imposing a sentence of life without parole, Justice Mander said: "If not here, then when?"
Justice Mander said such life sentences without parole were reserved only for the "very worst murders".
On the last day of a four-day sentencing hearing, Justice Mander spent almost an hour reminding Tarrant of each person he killed and injured.
Tarrant, who said through a lawyer in court that he did not oppose the prosecution's application for a life without parole sentence, did not react to the sentence.
But they have served justice, giving the maximum prison time without parole," said Hina Amir, 34, who was outside Al Noor mosque when Tarrant began his attack.

美国零售巨头沃尔玛表示将与微软合作竞购TikTok在美国的业务。
沃尔玛告诉英国广播公司，它认为与中国视频共享应用程序达成协议将有助于其扩大业务。
沃尔玛发言人向英国广播公司证实，确认该公司正在达成一项交易：“我们相信，沃尔玛与微软的合作伙伴关系将满足美国TikTok用户的期望，同时满足美国政府监管机构的担忧。”
微软在8月初证实它正在与TikTok进行谈判，它告诉英国广播公司“目前没有任何东西可分享”。
据报道，如果达成交易，TikTok在美国的业务可能会获得高达300亿美元（220亿英镑）的价格。

Image copyright Getty ImagesThe US retail giant Walmart has said it will team up with Microsoft to make a bid for the US operations of TikTok.
Walmart told the BBC it thought a deal with the Chinese video-sharing app would help it expand its operations.
Confirming that the company was pursuing a deal, a Walmart spokesperson told the BBC: "We are confident that a Walmart and Microsoft partnership would meet both the expectations of US TikTok users while satisfying the concerns of US government regulators."
Microsoft, which confirmed at the beginning of August that it was in talks with TikTok, told the BBC it had "nothing to share at this time".
According to reports, TikTok's US operations could fetch as much as $30bn (£22bn) if a deal is reached.

当被问及他受到的伤害有多严重时，马奎尔说：“他们打了我很多腿。
马奎尔说，希腊人只是想让局势平静下来，但他们只是“有点侵略性”。
在他们殴打我五分钟之前说我的职业生涯已经结束，所以我知道他们知道我是谁。
我已经想到了很多事情，但是答案是我不知道。
我真的不知道，是否像你说的那样，是嫉妒，被缝合，误解。

Asked how badly he was hurt, Maguire said: "They hit me a lot on the legs.
Maguire said the Greek men were just trying to calm it down but they were just being "a little bit aggressive".
Five minutes before they were beating me up saying my career is over, so I knew they knew who I was.
A lot of things have gone through my mind but the answer is I don't know.
Whether, like you say, it was jealously, stitched up, misunderstanding, I really don't know.

他们现在正在寻找闭路电视录像，并与艺术品盗窃专家和法医团队合作。
但是专门从事追回失窃作品的艺术侦探亚瑟·布兰德（Arthur Brand）表示，这种盗窃案是可以预料的。
他说，犯罪分子一直在购买被盗的艺术品，并将其交换为较短的监禁期限。
尽管荷兰当局在追回失窃的艺术品方面拥有良好的记录，但作品往往可以消失多年。

One of the Old Masters of the Dutch Golden Age, Frans Hals painted the work in 1626.
They are now scouring CCTV footage and working with art theft experts and forensic teams.
But Arthur Brand, an art detective specialising in recovering stolen works, said a theft of this sort had been expected.
Criminals had been buying stolen works of art and exchanging them for shorter jail terms, he said.
Although Dutch authorities have a good track record in retrieving stolen art, works can often disappear for years.

这些工作将主要在其商店进行，但90个职位也将在其支持中心失去。
现在，它在英国的367家商店的营业时间比大流行之前要少得多，该公司已要求员工减少营业时间。
该公司曾警告称，将在6月份裁员1000人，但在本周完成重组协议后，这一数字有所上升。
行业机构UK Hospitality表示，尽管锁定措施有所缓解，但仍有大约三分之一的饭店和酒吧仍未营业，因为人们仍对这种病毒的传播感到担忧。

It 367 UK stores are now open for significantly fewer hours than they were before the pandemic, and the firm has asked staff to reduce their hours.
The firm had warned it would cut 1,000 jobs back in June, but that number has risen after it finalised a restructuring deal this week.
Industry body UK Hospitality says around a third of restaurants and bars have still not reopened despite the easing of lockdown, as people remain nervous about the spread of the virus.

这将使该银行保持较低的利率长期不变，从而刺激增长以帮助解决失业问题。
如果感觉到通货膨胀率可以超过该水平，它可以提高利率-但这使消费者和企业借钱变得更加昂贵。
自十多年前的金融危机以来，许多中央银行一直将利率维持在非常低的水平。
中央银行已经进行了创新，特别是采取了量化宽松政策，用新创造的货币购买了金融资产，一些中央银行还尝试了低于零的利率。

It will allow the bank to keep interest rates lower for longer, stimulating growth to help tackle unemployment.
If it feels inflation could go above that level, it can raise interest rates - however this makes borrowing money more expensive for consumers and businesses.
Many central banks have held interest rates at very low levels since the financial crisis more than a decade ago.
Central banks have innovated, notably with quantitative easing, buying financial assets with newly created money, and some have experimented with interest rates below zero.
It proposes adapting an existing one - the inflation target - in a way that could combat what Mr Powell calls the persistent undershoot of inflation.

TikTok被给予90天的时间出售给一家美国公司或在美国面临禁令。
特朗普总统声称，由于中国互联网公司ByteDance拥有TikTok，TikTok属于国家安全威胁。
这一切都不是梅耶尔离开迪斯尼（Walt Disney）担任TikTok职位时签署的。
华盛顿的官员担心TikTok可能会将美国用户的数据传递给中国政府，而ByteDance拒绝这样做。

Mr Mayer joined TikTok in June after leaving his role as Disney's head of streaming services.
TikTok was given 90 days to be sold to an American firm or face a ban in the US.
President Trump claims TikTok is a national security threat because of who it is owned by, Chinese internet firm ByteDance.
All of this is not what Mr Mayer signed up for when he left Walt Disney to take on the role at TikTok.
Officials in Washington are concerned that TikTok could pass American users' data to the Chinese government, something ByteDance has denied doing.
