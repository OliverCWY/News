在RNC的过程中多次提到，中国希望拜登在11月份获胜的观点已成为共和党对民主党的最新攻击路线。
在整个RNC中，特朗普的盟友一直将中国当作出气筒，部分是为了增强总统的任职成就。
其他人则指责中国抢夺美国人的工作，然后称赞特朗普将这些工作带回美国。
特朗普总统领导了这一行动，我们需要其他国家加入他的斗争，”他说。
但是民主党人甚至陈先生的朋友，包括他在中国的律师滕彪，都表示，特朗普先生自己的声明削弱了他作为人权捍卫者的形象。

The notion that China prefers Mr Biden to win in November has become the latest Republican line of attack against the Democrats, mentioned several times over the course of the RNC.
Throughout the RNC, Mr Trump's allies have used China as a punching bag, partially to bolster the President's achievements in office.
Others accused China of robbing Americans of jobs, then credited Mr Trump with bringing these jobs back to America.
President Trump has led on this and we need the other countries to join him in this fight," he said.
But Democrats and even friends of Mr Chen, including his lawyer in China, Mr Teng Biao, said Mr Trump's own statements undercut his portrayal as a champion of human rights.

惠灵顿（路透社）-一名新西兰法官周四（8月27日）判处白人白人至上主义者布伦顿·塔兰特无罪假释，判处无期徒刑，原因是该国最致命的枪击事件中杀死了51名穆斯林信徒，称该判决不足以惩治“邪恶”罪行。
这是新西兰法院第一次判其终身有期徒刑。
克赖斯特彻奇高级法院法官卡梅伦·曼德（Cameron Mander）表示，塔兰特没有表现出re悔之情，而且无论他在监狱中待多久，都不足以弥补他的罪行。
2019年3月15日，塔兰特手持军用半自动武器袭击了克赖斯特彻奇的艾尔诺尔清真寺，不分青红皂白地向聚集在周五祈祷的穆斯林开枪，同时用头戴式摄像头拍摄大屠杀并播放塞尔维亚反穆斯林的国歌。
没有任何惩罚将我们的亲人带回来。”目标为Al Noor清真寺的伊玛目Gamal Fouda先生说。

WELLINGTON (REUTERS) - A New Zealand judge sentenced white supremacist Brenton Tarrant to life in prison without parole on Thursday (Aug 27) for killing 51 Muslim worshippers in the country’s deadliest shooting, saying the sentence was not enough punishment for the “wicked” crimes.
It was the first time a court in New Zealand had sentenced a person to prison for the rest of their life.
Christchurch High Court Judge Cameron Mander said Tarrant had shown no remorse and that no matter how long he spent in prison it would not be long enough to atone for his crimes.
On March 15, 2019 Tarrant stormed the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch armed with military-style semi-automatics, indiscriminately shooting at Muslims gathered for Friday prayers, while filming his massacre from a head-mounted camera and playing a Serbian anti-Muslim anthem.
No punishment will bring our loved ones back,” said Mr Gamal Fouda, the imam of Al Noor mosque which was targeted.

近年来，澳大利亚与它最大的贸易伙伴中国的关系恶化了，特别是随着堪培拉出台了防止外国干扰的法律并禁止中国公司华为参与其5G推出。
但是他说：“在任何外国政府试图通过与地方政府达成协议来破坏澳大利亚外交政策主权的情况下，澳大利亚都需要自我保护。”
他对美国广播公司新闻说：“中国将把它（法律）视为针对中国的另一项措施。”
法律允许外交部长马里斯·佩恩女士审查与外国政府的所有现有和未来协议，并取消或取消它们。
法律生效六个月内，各州，领地，理事会和大学必须将与外国政府的所有安排通知联邦政府。

Australia's ties with China, its largest trading partner, have deteriorated in recent years, particularly as Canberra introduced laws to prevent foreign interference and banned Chinese firm Huawei from participating in its 5G rollout.
But he said: "Where any foreign government seeks to undermine the sovereignty of Australia's foreign policy by seeking to do deals with subnational governments, Australia needs to protect itself."
"China will see it (the law) as another measure that is targeted at China," he told ABC News.
The law allows the Foreign Minister, Ms Marise Payne, to examine all existing and future deals with foreign governments and to abolish or cancel them.
Within six months of the law coming into effect, states, territories, councils and universities will have to notify the federal government of all arrangements with foreign governments.

只有27％的人认为他们的国家在应对大流行方面做得不好。
该数据来自6月10日至8月3日通过电话对14个发达经济体的14276名成年人进行的全国代表性调查。
就政府对这场危机的处理看法，这两个国家在政治上也存在高度分化。
调查还发现，有58％的人表示大流行改变了他们的生活，而42％的人表示变化不大或根本没有变化。
相比之下，丹麦近四分之三的人说现在有更多的团结，而加拿大，瑞典，韩国和澳大利亚的一半以上也说他们的国家变得更加团结。

Just 27 per cent believe their countries have handled the pandemic poorly.
The data was obtained from a nationally representative survey of 14,276 adults from 14 advanced economies, conducted by telephone from June 10 to Aug 3.
These two nations also have high levels of political polarisation on views of the government's handling of this crisis.
The survey also found that a median of 58 per cent say the pandemic has changed their life, while 42 per cent reported not too much change or none at all.
By contrast, nearly three-quarters in Denmark say there is more unity now, while more than half in Canada, Sweden, South Korea and Australia also say their countries have become more united.

伦敦-欧洲备受打击：欧洲大陆人口最多的国家新记录的感染数量不断增加，冠状病毒大流行再次爆发的威胁正在蔓延。
但是所有欧洲国家政府都渴望避免对大流行早期阶段的行动自由重新实行全面封锁和其他严格控制。
感染率第二高的国家是马耳他的小岛国，该国已记录了120例新感染病例，其次是法国的60例新感染病例。
但是，如果现在影响到年轻人的感染传播到其他年龄段，这一切都可能会改变，就像度假者返回家人时那样。
法国卫生部长奥利维尔·韦兰（OlivierVéran）承认，这已经发生在他的国家/地区，马赛市的老年人感染率正在上升。

LONDON - A grave spectre is haunting Europe: The threat of the return of the coronavirus pandemic, as the number of new recorded infections continues to rise in the continent's most populous countries.
But all European governments are eager to avoid reimposing the blanket lockdown and other drastic controls on the freedom of movement seen in the earlier stages of the pandemic.
The second-highest infection rate is in the small island-state of Malta which has registered 120 new infection cases, followed by over 60 new cases for France.
Everything may change, however, if the infections which now affect younger citizens spread to other age groups, as they will when holidaymakers return to their families.
French Health Minister Olivier Véran admits that this is already happening in his country, with infections rising among the elderly in the city of Marseille.
