The decision by NBA players to boycott yesterday’s playoff games was an unprecedented show of solidarity – one that spread to the Women’s NBA, Major League Baseball and US professional soccer.

When asked about the protest on Thursday, however, Donald Trump brushed it off.

“I know their ratings have been very bad because I think people are a little tired of the NBA, frankly, but I don't know too much about the protests," he said, adding that the league has become “like a political organisation”.

The president’s words are a sharp contrast to his full-bore attacks on the National Football League and players like Colin Kaepernick, who protested police brutality by kneeling during the playing of the national anthem.

At a political rally three years ago, Trump said Kaepernick and others like him should be fired by their teams. That was the start of months of attacks on the league that continued through to the mid-term elections the following year.

What changed? After the death of George Floyd and other black Americans at the hands of police officers, public awareness of racial injustice has increased. And the Republicans have made efforts during their convention this week to reach out the black voters – efforts that could be undermined if the president started attacking the league that has the largest black audience in the US.

The next time Trump is in front of one of his (smaller) rally crowds, however, all bets are off.
