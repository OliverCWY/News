香港（CNN）由奥巴马政府带到美国的中国人权活动人士周三出席共和党全国代表大会，并在其中赞扬了唐纳德·特朗普总统。
但是，在向RNC的现场演讲中，他没有提及奥巴马。
陈在会议上的视频讲话中称赞特朗普为领导“制止中国的侵略”而进行的斗争，并呼吁美国人“为世界而支持，投票和为特朗普总统而战”。
刚刚看过特朗普或拜登，中国会选择哪个候选人？

Hong Kong (CNN) A Chinese human rights activist brought to the United States by the Obama administration appeared at the Republican National Convention Wednesday, where he praised President Donald Trump.
However, in the live speech to the RNC, he did not mention Obama.
Speaking by video to the conference, Chen praised Trump for leading the fight "to stop China's aggression," and called on Americans "to support, vote, and fight for President Trump for the sake of the world."

（CNN）梅拉尼亚·特朗普的前知己史蒂芬妮·温斯顿·沃尔科夫（Stephanie Winston Wolkoff）在幕后揭露了第一夫人与第一女儿伊万卡·特朗普之间据称存在争议的关系。
她是梅拉尼亚（Melania）在东翼（East Wing）的第一名雇员，并作为特别政府雇员无薪工作。
这位官员说：“她夸大了与第一夫人的关系，”以及其他惹恼东翼的行为。
华盛顿特区的司法部长于今年早些时候起诉特朗普就职委员会，指控其滥用非营利组织资金。
根据这本书的摘录，特朗普宣称：“我要里克立即开除！

(CNN) Melania Trump's former confidant Stephanie Winston Wolkoff is dishing out a behind-the-scenes look at the allegedly contentious relationship between the first lady and first daughter Ivanka Trump.
She was Melania's first hire in the East Wing and worked unpaid as a special government employee.
"She inflated her relationship with the first lady," along with other behaviors that irked the East Wing, the official said.
The attorney general in Washington, DC, sued the Trump inaugural committee earlier this year for abusing nonprofit funds.
According to the excerpt of book, Trump proclaimed, "I want Rick fired right now\!

在美国，只有不到十分之二的人（18％）表示该国现在更加团结。
但是在英国和美国，这一数字要低得多：分别为46％和47％。
美国不是唯一支持政府对冠状病毒反应支持的党派倾向的国家-皮尤（Pew）调查在英国和西班牙发现了相同的模式。
在西班牙和美国，大约四分之三的政府支持者表示，他们的国家对冠状病毒的处理良好-但在英国，这一数字刚刚超过一半。
在美国，有58％的国家表示更多的合作会有所帮助，而有37％的国家表示不会。

In the United States, fewer than two in 10 people (18%) said the country is more united now.
But in the United Kingdom and the United States, the figures were much lower: 46% and 47% respectively.
The United States is not the only country where support for the government's coronavirus response broke along partisan lines -- the Pew survey detected the same pattern in the UK and in Spain.
In Spain and the United States, about three-quarters of government supporters say their country has handled the coronavirus well -- but in the UK, the figure is just over half.
In the United States, 58% said more cooperation between countries would have helped and 37% said it would not.

There is no reason for Chinese companies and individuals to participate in relevant illegal sanctions in their own country," said Zhao.
Home to vital shipping lanes, the South China Sea is widely deemed as a potential flashpoint for military conflicts between the US and China.
Last month, the US Navy staged exercises involving two aircraft carrier strike groups in the South China Sea -- the first time it had done so in six years.
This week, China launched three military exercises on Monday alone in Pacific waters, from the South China Sea in the south to the Bohai Sea in the north.

Breus说，睡眠很复杂，一个人可能会失眠的原因很多，例如压力或工作日程。

It depends on what type of sleep issue you are having, since Breus said there are 88 different sleep disorders.
"I think that apps will be helpful for people to manage stress, become educated and learn about their sleep environment," Breus said.

Apps that track your sleepTal said sleep-tracking apps — such as Sleep Cycle, Sleep Genius, Sleep Score and Pillow — can be helpful for those with mild sleep issues as a way to improve sleep environment and regimen.
Sleep is complicated, said Breus, and there are many reasons a person could have insomnia — like stress or work schedule.

了解它们的微小起源，其大小足够小，可以放入鸵鸟蛋大小的鸡蛋中，这将阐明它们的生长和发育方式。
但是研究人员在那个位置发现的卵被弄平了，这使得对三维头骨的研究变得困难。
一项新研究专注于研究人员所称的首次发现的钛金蜥蜴类蜥脚类动物的近乎完整的胚胎头骨。
根据他们对化石的扫描，研究人员可以从本质上看待卵内部，并确定这种孵化的样子-而回头看它们的奇特面孔并不是他们所期望的。
但是，昆德拉（Kundrát）推测，鉴于没有证据表明泰坦蜥蜴的恐龙有父母的照顾，这些婴儿一旦孵化就很可能独自为食物和防御。

Understanding their tiny origins, small enough to fit inside an egg the size of an ostrich egg, would shed light on how they grew and developed.
But the eggs researchers discovered at that site were flattened, making the study of a three-dimensional skull difficult.
A new study focused on what researchers are calling the first discovery of a nearly intact embryonic skull of a titanosaurian sauropod.
Based on their scans of the fossil, the researchers could essentially look inside the egg and determine what this hatchling looked like -- and the peculiar face looking back at them wasn't what they expected.
But, Kundrát speculated, given that there is no evidence of parental care in titanosaurian dinosaurs, these babies were likely on their own for food and defense once they hatched.

The image above is an illustration from Adventures Overland, depicting what the bus might look like.
Agarwal tells CNN Travel the idea was inspired by an incredible solo drive from London to Delhi he did back in 2010.
Since founding Adventures Overland, Agarwal and Madan have organized three India-to-London expeditions, in which travelers bring their own cars and travel in a convoy.

These items are meant to help visitors contextualize what happiness looks like for others in different parts of the globe.
Denmark, for example, frequently lands near the top of surveys ranking the world's happiest nations, including the United Nations' annual World Happiness Report.
Wiking says that, if his studies at the Happiness Research Institute have shown him anything, it's that humans are incredibly resilient.

在黑暗时代，红红的嘴唇被视为与魔鬼混在一起的标志。
然后，费尔德（Felder）的书解释说，当美国选举权运动大行其道时，国际同行也是如此。
费尔德说，阿道夫·希特勒“非常讨厌红色唇膏”。
他们对激进分子周润发（MarlénChow）做出反应，周润发通过涂红色口红来挑衅她的审讯者。
戴着红色嘴唇，全世界的抗议者都利用了一个世纪前曾经进行的选举权运动的力量。

In the Dark Ages, red lips were seen as a sign of commingling with the devil.
Then, Felder's book explains, as the American suffrage movement adopted red lips, their international counterparts did, too.
Adolf Hitler "famously hated red lipstick," Felder said.
They were reacting to activist Marlén Chow, who defied her interrogators by applying red lipstick.
By wearing red lips, protesters all over the world have tapped into the same power the suffrage movement once plumbed a century earlier.

这本书收集了政府批准的苏联时代明信片，展示了旅馆，林荫大道，公共房屋和公共建筑，周围是大片蓝天和阳光普照的背景。
明信片-作为国家宣传的一种形式-展现了宏伟的景象，尽管在为社会主义每个人设计的不起眼的城市环境中。
建筑评论家兼作家欧文·赫瑟利（Owen Hatherley）在电话采访中说：“世俗正是这些明信片所要展现的质量。”
“但是很明显的是，在当时的苏联，苏联现代主义贯穿了整个20世纪的城市主义，通常具有鲜明的地区特色。
“我很想知道是谁寄了这些明信片，”海瑟利沉思。

The postcards -- as a form of state propaganda -- offer a vision of grandeur, albeit in an unremarkable urban setting designed for the socialist everyman.
"Mundanity is exactly the quality these postcards wanted to give out," said architecture critic and author Owen Hatherley in a phone interview.
"But what is clear is that, in the then-Soviet Union, Soviet Modernism seeped through most of the 20th century urbanism, often taking distinct regional characteristics.
"I would be curious to know who sent these postcards," Hatherley mused.

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-通过吸引人的飞机制服吸引公众注意力时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常为白色，但并非总是如此（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板应用了最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，合并和收购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
