Doctors in the United States have been sharing the difficulty of obtaining gear to treat patients with Covid-19.

And not so urgent that they can’t harmonise sweetly, and then absurdly, on The Trail of the Lonesome Pine.
The film is a riot of expert slapstick and crosstalk, but it’s the bumbling duo’s unhurried, guileless air which makes it sublime.
The much-anticipated finale of Mantel’s trilogy about King Henry VIII’s right-hand-man Thomas Cromwell has been widely acclaimed.
Mantel’s Cromwell is a complex, consummate player, more powerful in many ways than the king himself.

## Covid-19：病毒在办公室中的传播方式

办公室工作人员的不良卫生状况也会加剧这一情况：2019年英国的一项调查显示，只有61％的英国办公室工作人员上厕所后用温水和肥皂正确洗手。
空气中的病毒肮脏的手指和桌子是一回事，但病毒传播的最大风险是空气中传播的病毒。
“如果一个人生病了，他或她可以通过咳嗽和打喷嚏，触摸表面并紧密接触他人来传播细菌。
办公室的流通空气也可能导致微生物扩散。
这意味着要与生病或接触被感染表面的人接触，然后将其转移到家里的表面。

Poor hygiene from office workers can exacerbate to this, too: a 2019 UK survey showed that only 61% of UK office workers washed their hands properly with warm water and soap after going to the toilet.
A virus in the airDirty fingers and desks are one thing, but the biggest risk for the spread of virus is what’s travelling through the air.
“If one person is sick, he or she could spread the germs through coughing and sneezing, touching surfaces and contacting others closely.
The circulated air of offices can also contribute to the spread of microbes.
That means coming in contact with someone who is sick or touching an infected surface, then transferring it to your surfaces at home.

美国的确诊冠状病毒病例比其他任何国家都要多，有超过100,000个阳性测试。
特朗普先生说，该命令将迫使通用汽车（GM）为联邦政府制造急需的医疗呼吸机。
当天早些时候，特朗普先生在推特上说，通用汽车已承诺“很快”给我们40,000名急需的通风设备。
在经过三个小时的辩论后，民主党领导的众议院的民主党人和共和党人于周五以语音表决方式批准了该刺激计划。

起源于中国的冠状病毒爆发已感染了55万人。
以下是一些地图和图表，可帮助您了解该病毒到目前为止的经济影响。
投资者担心冠状病毒的传播会破坏经济增长，而政府的行动可能不足以阻止这种下降。
美国参议院通过了一项2万亿美元（合170亿英镑）的冠状病毒援助法案，以帮助工人和企业之后，全球市场也有所复苏。
根据经济合作与发展组织（OECD）的报告，由于冠状病毒的爆发，世界经济可能会以今年以来自2009年以来的最低增速增长。

The coronavirus outbreak, which originated in China, has infected more than 550,000 people.
Here is a selection of maps and charts to help you understand the economic impact of the virus so far.
Investors fear the spread of the coronavirus will destroy economic growth and that government action may not be enough to stop the decline.
Global markets did also recover some ground after the US Senate passed a $2 trillion (£1.7tn) coronavirus aid bill to help workers and businesses.
The world's economy could grow at its slowest rate since 2009 this year due to the coronavirus outbreak, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).

But the night before they were due to move, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced wide-ranging restrictions on movement.
"My dream home now hangs in the balance."
Rachel says that, in theory, they could still move, but "in reality, I don't know" whether it will happen.
She works in academia, and her husband works for a firm that supplies accessibility construction services, and they fell they would still be able to pay the mortgage.
Until Thursday, Mehreen Ali's hopes of moving her young family into a new house in April were moving along nicely.

However, the Transport Secretary told MPs he can't rule out the state taking an ownership stake in UK airlines that have been battered by coronavirus.
Grant Shapps told MPs on the Transport Select Committee that nothing had been ruled out in its response to coronavirus for the aviation sector.
Virgin Atlantic had previously suggested the government offer UK carriers £7.5 billion in credit facilities.
You'd be forgiven for being confused about whether the government is going to bailout UK-based airlines, or not.
First ministers indicated that an industry-wide bailout was on the cards.

Arnold在UV Light Technology工作，该公司为英国的医院，制药公司和食品制造商提供消毒设备。
最近，随着全球对Covid-19的担忧达到非同寻常的新高度，他发现自己提出了一些不同寻常的要求。
当前在互联网上泛滥的大量“健康”建议中，可以用紫外线消毒皮肤，衣服或其他物体的想法非常流行。
据报道，在泰国，一所大学甚至建造了一条紫外线隧道，学生可以通过紫外线隧道进行自我消毒。
确实，由于“新的冠状病毒讨厌太阳”，正如社交媒体上的一些报道所声称的那样，阳光会立即杀死太阳吗？

Arnold works for UV Light Technology, a company that provides disinfecting equipment to hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and food manufacturers across the UK.
Recently, as the global anxiety about Covid-19 has reached extraordinary new heights, he’s found himself fielding some unusual requests.
Among the abundant “health” advice currently swarming around the internet, the idea that you can disinfect your skin, clothing or other objects with UV light has proved extremely popular.
In Thailand, a college has reportedly even built a UV tunnel that students can walk through to disinfect themselves.
And is it true that since “the new coronavirus hates the sun”, sunshine will immediately kill it, as some reports on social media have claimed?

本周早些时候，美国的失业保险人数猛增至三百万，这一破纪录的数字远远超过了之前的高点。
由于Covid-19，数百万人被裁员，世界各地的经济体都在经历类似的症状。
当然，对于许多突然失去收入的人来说，这是一个财务挑战，但同时也带来了心理挑战。
在那之前，贝尔主要靠现金小费和每周的工资维持稳定的生活，养活了他的五口之家。
他说：“我没有难受的感觉，但是当您使用工资支票支付支票时很难。”

Earlier this week, unemployment insurance claims in the US soared past three million, a record-breaking number which far surpasses previous highs.
Around the world economies are all experiencing similar symptoms as millions of people are laid off because of Covid-19.
This is, of course, a financial challenge for many who have suddenly lost their income, but it also presents a psychological challenge.
Until then, Bell was making a steady living mostly from cash tips and weekly wages, supporting his family of five.
“I have no hard feelings but it’s hard when you live pay check to pay check,” he says.

随着社会疏离和自我孤立成为我们生活的一部分，有必要在某人的客厅见面。
从好的方面来说，这拓宽了您的潜在邀请清单-另一个镇上的朋友和您的隔壁邻居一样能够加入在线组。
Book Riot的在线读书俱乐部指南介绍了一些选项-他们认为Google Hangouts之类的服务可很好地复制现场小组体验。
（当然也可以使用其他视频聊天应用程序-CNET的最新指南选择了其中的七个收藏夹）。
但是Book Riot还指出，事情不必像IRL那样运行，例如在Facebook上成立私人团体或好读书。

With social distancing and self-isolation becoming a part of all our lives, an alternative to meeting up in someone's living room is necessary.
On the plus side, this widens your potential invitation list - a friend in another town is just as able to join an online group as your next-door neighbour.
Book Riot's online bookclub guide runs through some of the options - they argue that a service like Google Hangouts is good for replicating the live group experience.
(Other video chat applications are of course available - CNET's recent guide selects seven of their favourites).
But Book Riot also makes the point that things don't have to run quite the same way as IRL, for example starting a private group on Facebook or goodreads.

而且，由于自然是自然，汽油会随着时间的推移而降解-通常在三到六个月内消失。
波动性在各种情况下意味着很多事情，并且在很多情况下都与“易燃”混为一谈。
燃料箱装满后，最好的选择是倒入一些燃料稳定剂，以防止燃料蒸发和氧化长达两年，具体取决于制造商。
保持柴油车的油箱充满油，并考虑使用柴油稳定剂，以将水和氧化保持在最低水平。
如果您驾驶电动汽车，请趁此机会为汽车充满电并使其插电。

And, because nature is nature, petrol will degrade over time – generally anywhere from three to six months.
Volatility means a lot of things in various contexts, and has been conflated in a lot of cases with ‘flammable’.
The best bet, once you have a full fuel tank, is to pour in some fuel stabiliser, which protects the fuel against evaporation and oxidisation for up to two years, depending on the manufacturer.
Keep your diesel car’s tank brimmed, and consider a diesel fuel stabiliser, which keeps water and oxidation to a minimum.
If you drive an electric car, take this opportunity to fully charge your car and leave it plugged in.

首先是“婴儿潮一代”：出生于1946年至1964年的战后婴儿潮时期的人。
反对他们的理由是，他们享受了免费的高等教育和负担得起的住房，然后制造了巨额债务和气候变化的混乱局面，供其他所有人清理。
对“千禧一代”（指80年代初期至90年代中期出生的人）的指控是，他们杀死了从蛋黄酱到织物调理剂的所有东西，痴迷自拍照，并在鳄梨和吐司和燕麦拿铁上花了钱。
他们常常被贴上懒洋洋，自我迷恋的“雪花”的标签。千禧一代毫无疑问地面临着经济焦虑，生活成本日益高涨，就业前景pre可危，而婴儿潮一代则厌倦了将这些社会问题归咎于他们。
哦，然后是“ X世代”，坐在中间被人们遗忘了，还有“ Z世代”，它们是在社交媒体上成长的年轻人，他们刚刚加入竞争。

First, there are the “Boomers”: people born in the post-war baby boom between 1946 and 1964.
The case against them is that they’ve enjoyed free higher education and affordable housing, and then created the combined mess of enormous debts and climate change for everyone else to clean up.
The charges against “Millennials” – anyone born between the early 80s and mid-90s – is that they’ve killed off everything from mayonnaise to fabric conditioner, are obsessed with selfies, and fritter their money away on avocado on toast and oatmeal lattes.
They are often labelled as lazy, self-obsessed “snowflakes.”And where Millennials undoubtedly face economic anxiety with increasingly high living costs and precarious employment prospects, Boomers are sick of these societal issues being blamed on them.
Oh, and then there’s “Generation X”, sitting largely forgotten in the middle, and “Generation Z”, the youngsters raised on social media who are just entering the fray…
