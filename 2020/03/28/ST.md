华盛顿（路透社）-美国众议院周五（3月27日）批准了一项2.2万亿美元（3.1万亿新元）的援助计划，这是历史上最大的一揽子计划，以帮助应对日趋严重的冠状病毒大流行所造成的经济衰退，美国总统唐纳德·特朗普迅速将其签署为法律。
民主党领导的众议院中的民主党人和共和党人通过了投票表决批准了该方案，从而回避了共和党代表托马斯·马西（Thomas Massie）提出的程序性挑战，后者试图进行正式的有记录的投票。
到2019年初，众议院议员的平均年龄为58岁，远高于整个美国人口的平均年龄38岁。
但是随着法案的通过，您将看到我们将共同努力，我们将共同赢得胜利。”众议院共和党最高领导人凯文·麦卡锡说。
据路透社统计，上周五，美国的冠状病毒病例数超过了中国和意大利，超过了100,000。

WASHINGTON (REUTERS) – The US House of Representatives on Friday (March 27) approved a US$2.2 trillion (S$3.1 trillion) aid package – the largest in history – to help cope with the economic downturn inflicted by the intensifying coronavirus pandemic, and President Donald Trump quickly signed it into law.
Democrats and Republicans in the Democratic-led House approved the package on a voice vote, turning back a procedural challenge from Republican Representative Thomas Massie, who had sought to force a formal, recorded vote.
The average age of House members was 58 at the beginning of 2019, well above the average age of 38 for the US population as a whole.
But with the passing of the Bill you will see that we will fight it together, and we will win together,” said Kevin McCarthy, the top House Republican.
On Friday, the number of coronavirus cases in the United States surpassed China and Italy at over 100,000, according to a Reuters tally.

TOKYO (REUTERS) - Tokyo has confirmed more than 50 new coronavirus infections, a record daily increase, public broadcaster NHK reported on Saturday (March 28) as the governor of Japan’s capital urged citizens to stay indoors.
Governor Yuriko Koike’s plea followed a surge in coronavirus infections this week that she said put Tokyo on the brink of an emergency.
Infections in Japan have climbed to more than 1,400, with 47 deaths, excluding those from a cruise ship quarantined last month.
People in the Osaka area in western Japan have also been asked to stay at home.
In Setagaya, a popular residential area in western Tokyo, many restaurants and shops were shut, although those that were open were doing brisk business, including an Italian restaurant that was filled with some young families and older couples.

SEOUL (REUTERS) - South Korea reported 146 new coronavirus cases on Friday (March 27), the highest number in a week, its disease control agency said on Saturday, with the country suffering a rise in imported cases from Europe and the United States in recent days.
The Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) did not say how many of Friday’s new cases were imported as it was still investigating.
Of the 9,478, the number of imported cases was at 363 as of Saturday.
The recent surge in imported cases has prompted authorities to toughen entry rules for travellers from Europe and the United States.
People arriving from the United States have to spend two weeks in quarantine and those showing symptoms like fever will be tested.

OAG Aviation的数据显示，中国航空业在2月中旬遭受的打击最大，运力比去年同期下降了70％。
他说：“现在的重点应该是国内复苏。
去年，中国国内市场拥有7.33亿个席位，是亚洲最大的市场。
此外，由于竞争很少，中国的航空公司倾向于依靠政府的支持，StrategicAero Research的分析师Saj Ahmad说。
不能挽救所有人，而现实是中国航空泡沫已在很大程度破裂。”

The Chinese aviation industry was hit hardest in mid-February with capacity down by up to 70 per cent from the same time last year, according to OAG Aviation data.
"The focus is now on a domestic recovery, as it should be.
With 733 million seats last year, China's domestic market is the biggest in Asia.
Furthermore, with little competition, Chinese airlines tend to be reliant on government support, said analyst Saj Ahmad of StrategicAero Research.
It can't save everyone, and the reality is that the bubble of Chinese aviation has burst in a very big way," he said.

## 科学家发现病毒存在于表面可能并不意味着具有传染性：科学家

### Presence of virus on surfaces may not mean it is infectious: Scientists

专家说，在患者留下痕迹后的几天内，可以检测到病毒，但这并不一定意味着它仍然具有传染性。
这是因为大多数检测方法都吸收了病毒遗传物质的存在，即使病毒本身的结构被破坏后，这种遗传物质仍会持续数天。
杜克-国大医学院新兴传染病项目主任王林法教授说，病毒需要完整的结构来感染宿主，例如人。
它的遗传物质位于其中心，被脂质膜包裹着：单链RNA基因组。
例如，病毒表面的尖峰很容易被热或太阳的紫外线破坏或变性。

A virus may be detectable on a surface days after a patient leaves behind traces, but this does not necessarily mean it is still infectious, experts say.
This is because most detection methods pick up the presence of the viral genetic material, which may linger for days even after the structure of the virus itself is broken.
An intact structure is needed for a virus to infect a host, such as a human, said Professor Wang Linfa, director of the emerging infectious diseases programme at Duke-NUS Medical School.
In its centre, encased in a lipid membrane, is its genetic material: a single-strand RNA genome.
For instance, the spikes on the virus' surface are susceptible to being destroyed, or denatured, by heat or the sun's ultraviolet rays.
