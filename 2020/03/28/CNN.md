在过去的80年中，世界上大部分地区都依靠鸡蛋来生产流感疫苗。
目前还没有针对该病毒的疫苗。而且由于它不同于流感病毒，因此使用鸡蛋等传统方法将行不通。
美国最大的流感疫苗生产商赛诺菲·巴斯德（Sanofi Pasteur）的发言人说，这些农场的位置是“专有信息”，并称“对安全性敏感”。
即使是传统上生产基于鸡蛋的流感疫苗的公司也正在加入。赛诺菲·巴斯德（Sanofi Pasteur）在2月份表示正在研发一种非蛋冠状病毒疫苗。
至少已经开始了一项1期冠状病毒疫苗试验。美国研究于3月17日向第一位参与者给药。

For the past 80 years, much of the world has relied on chicken eggs for the production of influenza vaccines.
There is no vaccine yet for the virus; and because it's different than the influenza virus, traditional methods like using eggs won't work.
The farms' locations are "proprietary information," said a spokesperson from Sanofi Pasteur, the biggest flu vaccine manufacturer in the US, citing "security sensitivities."
Even companies that traditionally make egg-based flu vaccines are jumping into the mix; Sanofi Pasteur said in February it was working on a non-egg coronavirus vaccine.
At least one Phase 1 coronavirus vaccine trial has now begun; the US study gave a dose to the first participant on March 17.

（CNN）只有一颗航天器在天王星和海王星附近飞行，这是我们太阳系边缘的神秘冰巨行星。
旅行者2号于1986年由天王星飞行，现在，由于某些数据中发现了一点点斑点，美国宇航局的科学家们知道它也飞过了等离子体。
等离子体是巨大的磁泡，可能夹住了地球大气的一部分，并将其发送到太空。
他们在浏览旧数据时发现了它，以寻找他们想回答的有关将来对天王星的潜在任务的问题。
但是自从旅行者2号于1986年和1989年飞越天王星或海王星以来，没有再执行任何任务。

(CNN) Only one spacecraft has flown near Uranus and Neptune, the mysterious ice giant planets on the edge of our solar system.
Voyager 2 flew by Uranus in 1986, and now, thanks to a little blip discovered in some data, NASA scientists know it also flew through a plasmoid.
A plasmoid is a giant magnetic bubble that likely pinched off part of the planet's atmosphere, sending it out into space.
They found it while looking through old data to find questions they wanted to answer on future potential missions to Uranus.
But no missions have followed up on Uranus or Neptune since the 1986 and 1989 flybys by Voyager 2.

该广告于1843年发布，用于切尔克斯的染发剂，有望将浅色的头发变成“美丽的”棕色或黑色。
直到20世纪初，才出现了我们所知道的染发剂-化学的，彩虹般的颜色，在商店购买或在沙龙上使用的-。
两年后，舒勒（Schueller）创立了自己的公司，法国无害染发剂公司（Hamless Hair Dye Company），这个名称旨在减轻人们对使用人造染发剂的恐惧。
1943年，克莱尔（Clairol）的一项印刷活动“灰发-无情的独裁者”宣称：“没有正义或仁慈，白发就能统治您的生活...

This advertisement for Circassian hair dye published in 1843 promises to change light hair into "beautiful" brown or black.
It wasn't until the early 20th century that hair dye as we know it -- chemical, in a rainbow of colors, shop-bought or salon-applied -- came to be.
Two years later, Schueller founded his business, the French Harmless Hair Dye Company -- a name meant to alleviate people's fears of using manufactured hair color.
A Clairol print campaign from 1943, "Gray Hair -- The Heartless Dictator," declared: "Without justice or kindness, gray hair can rule your life...
While gray coloring might trend on Instagram, natural gray hair still has a complicated reputation for women around the world -- and in China, men.

Su说：“当您是一家技术公司时，决定自己真正真正擅长的领域是非常重要的，因为您必须是最好的，第一名或第二名。”
Su成为芯片制造商AMD的首席执行官时，其股价已接近历史最低点。
短期内，随着越来越多的人购买由AMD技术支持的功能强大的笔记本电脑和游戏系统，以在家中工作和娱乐，冠状病毒甚至可能成为该公司的福音。

When Su took the helm of AMD in 2014, its stock was heading toward an all-time low.
"The most important thing for us back in 2014 was, first, choosing the right markets that were good for technology, " Su said.
"It is really important when you're a technology company to decide what you are really, really good at because you have to be the best, number one or number two," Su said.
When Su became CEO of chip maker AMD, its stock was near an all-time low.
In the short term, coronavirus may even be a boon to the company as more people stock up on powerful laptops and gaming systems powered by AMD technology for work and entertainment at home, Krewell said.

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

长期倡导和设计木制建筑的建筑师Michael Green表示，“现在有很多东西在融合。”
Or Framework是位于俄勒冈州波特兰的一座雄心勃勃的148英尺高的木塔，在去年因成本担忧而被取消之前，该塔被设定为美国最高的木塔。
考虑到在2018年之前，俄勒冈州成为美国第一个允许使用18层木制建筑的州，而在美国，没有任何地方允许任何超过6层的建筑物，这一决定意义重大。
该组织表示，除了担心森林砍伐外，洒水喷头不能有效防止烈焰扩散到木结构建筑中。

Reaching 280 feet in height, Mjøstårnet became the world's tallest timber building upon opening last year.
According to architect Michael Green, a longstanding advocate for -- and designer of -- wooden buildings, there are "a whole bunch of things converging right now."
Or Framework, an ambitious 148-foot-tall timber tower in Portland, Oregon, that was set to be the USA's tallest wooden tower before was canceled amid cost concerns last year.
The decision is significant given that, before 2018, when Oregon became the first US state to allow 18-story wooden buildings, nowhere in America permitted anything higher than six.
In addition to concerns about deforestation, the group says sprinklers are ineffective at preventing blazes from spreading through wood buildings.
