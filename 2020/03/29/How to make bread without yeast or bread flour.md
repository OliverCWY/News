Yorkshire puddings

It’s not bread, we know. But who’s ever sad to see a Yorkie? Whether small Yorkshire puddings with just enough space for a teacup of gravy or this Yorkshire pudding wrap, with a little plain flour to make a batter you’ve got comfort itself. They also freeze brilliantly. Are these unprecedented times not reason enough to throw caution to the wind and try Yorkies for breakfast?

Dumplings

We see your face falling, but it’s ok. You don’t have to have a box of suet in the cupboard to make fluffy dumplings. These use self-raising flour with a bit of butter and yoghurt. Cook on top of a vegetarian casserole or classic beef stew.

Pancakes from odds and ends of different flours

Plain white flour, wholemeal flour, spelt flour, or buckwheat flour – almost anything can be used to make quick and easy savoury pancakes. Fill with vegetables, cheese, beans, fish, it really doesn’t matter. If you can only find unusual flours such as gram flour, you can still make pancakes.
