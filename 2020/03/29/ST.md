特朗普宣布这一消息之际，美国的死亡人数已超过2,100，是两天前水平的两倍多。
纽约州州长安德鲁·库莫（Andrew Cuomo）在美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）上说，该计划与法律和总统要求重启经济的意愿背道而驰。
“我不知道这在法律上如何可执行。
尽管特朗普显然选择不对通往纽约以外的高速公路和机场施加检查站，但一些州还是施加了自己的限制。
在政府严格封锁武汉这一疾病的中心之后，中国新的冠状病毒病例趋于平缓。

Trump’s announcement came as the US death count crossed 2,100, more than double the level from two days ago.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on CNN the plan stood at odds with the law and the president’s desire to restart the economy.
“I don’t know how that could be legally enforceable.
Though Trump has apparently opted not to impose checkpoints on highways and airports leading out of New York, some states have imposed limits of their own.
New coronavirus cases in China levelled off after the government imposed a strict lockdown of Wuhan, the epicentre of the disease.

该部门主任恩戈兹·埃齐克（Ngozi Ezike）在一份声明中说：“从未发生过与Covid-19相关的婴儿死亡事件。”
他说：“我知道这则新闻有多难，尤其是关于这个很小的孩子。”

WASHINGTON (AFP) - A US infant has died from the Covid-19 illness, officials in the state of Illinois said on Saturday (March 28), marking an extremely rare case of juvenile death in the global pandemic.

The state Department of Public Health said the child who died in Chicago was younger than one year old and had tested positive for Covid-19.
"There has never before been a death associated with Covid-19 in an infant," the department's director Ngozi Ezike said in a statement.
"I know how difficult this news can be, especially about this very young child," he said.

So I bought things that felt like home," says Dr Wee, who is single and lives alone.
Still, she "wrestled with the decision of whether to stay or go", especially as she has an 87-year-old mother in Singapore.

24岁的Akhropele女士来自那加兰邦（Nagaland），那加兰邦是印度的八个东北部邦之一，人口众多，与中国人有面部特征。
Akhropele女士和她的同事被带到隔离中心，尽管检查表明他们很健康，但仍留在那里。

特定法律的需要警察无所适从，因为在处理这些种族歧视行为时存在法律真空。
查克马先生说：“我们需要一项类似的反对种族主义的专门法律，这将使警察有权记录种族主义袭击的肇事者。”

Ms Akhropele, 24, is from Nagaland, one of India's eight north-eastern states populated by many ethnic communities that share facial features with people from China.
Ms Akhropele and her colleagues were taken to the quarantine centre and kept there despite check-ups indicating they were healthy.
They were taking videos and it felt so weird," Ms Akhropele told The Sunday Times.
NEED FOR SPECIFIC LAW The police are at a loss, given the legal vacuum that exists when it comes to dealing with these acts of racial discrimination.
"We need a similar specific law against racism that will empower the police to book perpetrators of racist attacks," said Mr Chakma.

They received a delivery of masks from a Chinese manufacturer on March 21, the ministry said in a statement to AFP.
"A second test also revealed that the masks did not meet the quality norms.
The problem with the masks was that they did not close over the face properly, or had defective filters, the station added.
France's Health Minister Olivier Veran has announced that he had ordered more than a billion masks, notably from China, to help the country fight the coronavirus pandemic.

在社会疏离措施和强制性关闭娱乐场所之间，昨日无处可见人群。
在哈吉巷（Haji Lane），当地商店基本上没有购物者，尽管当《星期日泰晤士报》昨天访问时，许多路人正在拍照拍摄标志性的街道或橱窗购物。
商店老板说，他们受到大流行的严重打击-首先是旅行禁令，然后是社会隔离措施。
店主说，昨天的人群仅是大流行前的20％。
他说，尽管政府已经宣布了免除财产税的政策，以帮助遭受大流行的企业，但收益并不一定会流到租户。

Between social distancing measures and the mandatory closure of entertainment outlets, the usual crowds were nowhere to be seen yesterday.
In Haji Lane, local shops were largely devoid of shoppers, although a number of passers-by were taking pictures of the iconic street or window shopping when The Sunday Times visited yesterday.
Shop owners said they have been badly hit by the pandemic - first, with the travel ban, and then, with the social distancing measures.
The crowd yesterday was just 20 per cent of what it used to be before the pandemic, said storekeepers.
While the Government has announced property tax waivers to aid businesses hit by the pandemic, the benefits do not necessarily trickle down to tenants, he said.
