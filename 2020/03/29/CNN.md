Henny Ansell随着各国采取严格的锁定措施和旅行限制来对抗冠状病毒大流行，世界各地的夫妻都面临着类似的困境。
尽管有些人（例如Ansell）选择与他人保持距离，但另一些人则发现冠状病毒将它们拉近了距离。
由于封锁，詹姆斯·马什（James Marsh）和基耶拉·里珀（Kiera Leaper）相隔三个星期。
Hemangay上次采取措施之前，是在两周前与男友最后一次见面时-他们不知道会发生什么。
她说：“我们相遇已经很长时间了，我们已经计划了很长一段时间的婚礼。”

Henny AnsellAs countries impose strict lockdown measures and travel restrictions to combat the coronavirus pandemic, couples all over the world are facing similar predicaments.
While some -- like Ansell -- are choosing to stay apart, others have found coronavirus has brought them closer together.
James Marsh and Kiera Leaper are spending the next three weeks apart due to the lockdown.
Hemangay last saw his boyfriend two weeks ago, before the measures -- and they had no idea what was to come.
"We had been seeing each other for a really long time, we'd been planning this wedding for a really long time," she said.

到目前为止，有13名来自菲律宾的家庭工人在香港的冠状病毒检测结果呈阳性。

（CNN）朝鲜周日上午向日本海岸附近的海域发射了一颗身份不明的弹丸，这是金正恩政权在不到一个月的时间里第六次发射。
日本自卫队在周日的一份声明中说，导弹已降落在该国专属经济区外，该专属区距日本海岸200海里。
声明说：“对于包括日本在内的整个国际社会来说，朝鲜最近屡次发射导弹是一个严重的问题。”
“我们将继续竭尽全力收集和分析信息并保持警惕，以保护日本公民的生命和财产。”
韩国和美国都承认了发射，但无法确定发射的是哪种类型的射弹，只是射程短。

(CNN) North Korea fired an unidentified projectile into the sea off the coast of Japan Sunday morning, the sixth launch by the Kim Jong Un regime in less than a month.
Japan's Self Defense Force said in a statement Sunday that the missile had landed outside the country's Exclusive Economic Zone, which extends 200 nautical miles from Japan's shores.
"It is a serious issue for the whole international society including Japan that North Korea has repeatedly launched the missiles lately," the statement said.
"We continue to put the utmost effort to collect and analyze information and vigilance to protect the life and property of Japanese citizens."
Both South Korea and the US also acknowledged the launch, but were unable to confirm what type of projectile was fired, other than that it was short-range.

（CNN）据监视世界珊瑚礁的美国政府科学家称，澳大利亚的大堡礁可能经历了有史以来最广泛的漂白事件。
2016年10月拍摄的文件照片显示澳大利亚大堡礁的珊瑚褪色。
没有什么比大堡礁更重要了。
他说：“这次的情况并不那么激烈，但它的分布范围要广得多，所以我们在大堡礁上都能看到它。”
Eakin说，要使大堡礁完全从已经发生的漂白中恢复过来，将需要数十年的时间。

(CNN) Australia's Great Barrier Reef has likely experienced its most widespread bleaching event on record, according to a US government scientist who monitors the world's coral reefs.
A file photo taken in October 2016 shows coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.
And none is more vital than the Great Barrier Reef.
"This time it is not as intense, but it's much more widespread, so we're seeing it all over the Great Barrier Reef," he said.
For the Great Barrier Reef to fully recover from bleaching that has occurred would take decades, Eakin says.

等离子体是巨大的磁泡，可能夹住了地球大气的一部分，并将其发送到太空。

但是自从旅行者2号于1986年和1989年飞越天王星或海王星以来，没有再执行任何任务。

Voyager 2 flew by Uranus in 1986, and now, thanks to a little blip discovered in some data, NASA scientists know it also flew through a plasmoid.
A plasmoid is a giant magnetic bubble that likely pinched off part of the planet's atmosphere, sending it out into space.
They found it while looking through old data to find questions they wanted to answer on future potential missions to Uranus.
But no missions have followed up on Uranus or Neptune since the 1986 and 1989 flybys by Voyager 2.

在过去的80年中，世界上大部分地区都依靠鸡蛋来生产流感疫苗。
目前还没有针对该病毒的疫苗。而且由于它不同于流感病毒，因此使用鸡蛋等传统方法将行不通。
美国最大的流感疫苗生产商赛诺菲·巴斯德（Sanofi Pasteur）的发言人说，这些农场的位置是“专有信息”，并称“对安全性敏感”。
即使是传统上生产基于鸡蛋的流感疫苗的公司也正在加入。赛诺菲·巴斯德（Sanofi Pasteur）在2月份表示正在研发一种非蛋冠状病毒疫苗。
至少已经开始了一项1期冠状病毒疫苗试验。美国研究于3月17日向第一位参与者给药。

For the past 80 years, much of the world has relied on chicken eggs for the production of influenza vaccines.
There is no vaccine yet for the virus; and because it's different than the influenza virus, traditional methods like using eggs won't work.
The farms' locations are "proprietary information," said a spokesperson from Sanofi Pasteur, the biggest flu vaccine manufacturer in the US, citing "security sensitivities."
Even companies that traditionally make egg-based flu vaccines are jumping into the mix; Sanofi Pasteur said in February it was working on a non-egg coronavirus vaccine.
At least one Phase 1 coronavirus vaccine trial has now begun; the US study gave a dose to the first participant on March 17.

戈德布拉特将其描述为“一种在日益民族主义的文化中为日本奥运会建立支持的完美观念”。
在这样的背景下，Sandra Collins博士在她的著作《 1940年东京奥运会：失踪的奥运会》中写道，1940年奥运会“在使国际奥委会关于奥林匹克运动具有普遍性的言论合法化方面起到了重要作用。”
1938年7月16日在日本东京的Mantetsu Kaikan决定没收1940年东京奥运会时，对1940年东京奥组委会议的总体看法。
上周，日本副首相甚至在上周告诉议会委员会说，东京2020年被“诅咒了”，他认为奥运会是每40年一次世界大事而停止的。
2020年3月24日拍摄的照片显示了今年在福岛展出的东京奥运会的火焰。

Goldblatt described it as the "perfect notion around which to build support for a Japanese Olympics in an increasingly nationalist culture."
In this context, the 1940 Olympics was "instrumental in legitimizing the IOC rhetoric that the Olympic movement was universal," writes Dr. Sandra Collins in her book "The 1940 Tokyo Games: The Missing Olympics."
A general view of the 1940 Tokyo Olympic Organising Committee meeting, when the forfeiture of the 1940 Tokyo Olympic was decided, at Mantetsu Kaikan, on July 16, 1938 in Tokyo, Japan.
Last week, Japan's deputy prime minister even went as far as to tell a parliamentary committee last week that Tokyo 2020 was "cursed," arguing that the Olympics is stopped by extraordinary world events every 40 years.

## 历史上最致命的空袭发生在二战期间的东京，您可能从未听说过

### History's deadliest air raid happened in Tokyo during World War II and you've probably never heard of it

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
后来空袭被认为是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

## 木摩天大楼革命终于到来了吗？

### Has the wooden skyscraper revolution finally arrived?

Mjøstårnet的高度达到280英尺，于去年开放后成为世界上最高的木材建筑。
长期倡导和设计木制建筑的建筑师Michael Green表示，“现在有很多东西在融合。”
Or Framework是位于俄勒冈州波特兰的一座雄心勃勃的148英尺高的木塔，在去年因成本担忧而被取消之前，该塔被设定为美国最高的木塔。
考虑到在2018年之前，俄勒冈州成为美国第一个允许使用18层木制建筑的州，而在美国，没有任何地方允许任何超过6层的建筑物，这一决定意义重大。
该组织表示，除了担心森林砍伐外，洒水喷头不能有效防止烈焰扩散到木结构建筑中。

Reaching 280 feet in height, Mjøstårnet became the world's tallest timber building upon opening last year.
According to architect Michael Green, a longstanding advocate for -- and designer of -- wooden buildings, there are "a whole bunch of things converging right now."
Or Framework, an ambitious 148-foot-tall timber tower in Portland, Oregon, that was set to be the USA's tallest wooden tower before was canceled amid cost concerns last year.
The decision is significant given that, before 2018, when Oregon became the first US state to allow 18-story wooden buildings, nowhere in America permitted anything higher than six.
In addition to concerns about deforestation, the group says sprinklers are ineffective at preventing blazes from spreading through wood buildings.
