特朗普先生说，最新决定是根据白宫冠状病毒特别工作组的建议做出的。
特朗普在周六早些时候对记者谈到纽约局势时说：“我们希望看到它被隔离，因为这是一个热点...
纽约州州长安德鲁·库莫回答说，隔离纽约州将是“荒谬的”和“反美的”。
星期六，特朗普先生将USNS Comfort看成是一艘海军医院船，船上有1000张床，是从弗吉尼亚州飞往纽约的。
在此之前，特朗普签署了一项2.2万亿美元（1.8tr英镑）的救助法案，这是美国国会上周五通过的，这是美国历史上最大的财政刺激方案。

Mr Trump said the latest decision was taken on the recommendation of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.
Speaking to reporters earlier on Saturday about the situation in New York, Mr Trump said: "We'd like to see [it] quarantined because it's a hotspot...
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo responded by saying that quarantining the state of New York would be "preposterous" and "anti-American".
On Saturday, Mr Trump watched as the USNS Comfort, a navy hospital ship with 1,000 beds aboard, left for New York from Virginia.
It came after Mr Trump signed a $2.2 trillion (£1.8tr) bailout bill passed by Congress on Friday, the largest fiscal stimulus in US history.

Arnold在UV Light Technology工作，该公司为英国的医院，制药公司和食品制造商提供消毒设备。
最近，随着全球对Covid-19的担忧达到非同寻常的新高度，他发现自己提出了一些不同寻常的要求。
当前在互联网上泛滥的大量“健康”建议中，可以用紫外线消毒皮肤，衣服或其他物体的想法非常流行。
据报道，在泰国，一所大学甚至建造了一条紫外线隧道，学生可以通过紫外线隧道进行自我消毒。
确实，由于“新的冠状病毒讨厌太阳”，正如社交媒体上的一些报道所声称的那样，阳光会立即杀死太阳吗？

Arnold works for UV Light Technology, a company that provides disinfecting equipment to hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and food manufacturers across the UK.
Recently, as the global anxiety about Covid-19 has reached extraordinary new heights, he’s found himself fielding some unusual requests.
Among the abundant “health” advice currently swarming around the internet, the idea that you can disinfect your skin, clothing or other objects with UV light has proved extremely popular.
In Thailand, a college has reportedly even built a UV tunnel that students can walk through to disinfect themselves.
And is it true that since “the new coronavirus hates the sun”, sunshine will immediately kill it, as some reports on social media have claimed?

Global markets did also recover some ground after the US Senate passed a $2 trillion (£1.7tn) coronavirus aid bill to help workers and businesses.
The world's economy could grow at its slowest rate since 2009 this year due to the coronavirus outbreak, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).

Stockholm’s public transport company SL says it saw passenger numbers fall by 50% on subway and commuter trains last week.
Polls suggest three-quarters of Swedes are keeping at least a metre away from others at least some of the time.

But she argues that strong support for authorities will help, should the country follow others into lockdown.
But when it comes to day-to-day efforts to keep businesses and society functioning, Swedes’ working practices and passion for technology are two norms that are already playing out well during the corona crisis.

随着社会疏离和自我孤立成为我们生活的一部分，有必要在某人的客厅见面。
从好的方面来说，这拓宽了您的潜在邀请清单-另一个镇上的朋友和您的隔壁邻居一样能够加入在线组。
Book Riot的在线读书俱乐部指南介绍了一些选项-他们认为Google Hangouts之类的服务可很好地复制现场小组体验。
（当然也可以使用其他视频聊天应用程序-CNET的最新指南选择了其中的七个收藏夹）。
但是Book Riot还指出，事情不必像IRL那样运行，例如在Facebook上成立私人团体或好读书。

With social distancing and self-isolation becoming a part of all our lives, an alternative to meeting up in someone's living room is necessary.
On the plus side, this widens your potential invitation list - a friend in another town is just as able to join an online group as your next-door neighbour.
Book Riot's online bookclub guide runs through some of the options - they argue that a service like Google Hangouts is good for replicating the live group experience.
(Other video chat applications are of course available - CNET's recent guide selects seven of their favourites).
But Book Riot also makes the point that things don't have to run quite the same way as IRL, for example starting a private group on Facebook or goodreads.

首先是“婴儿潮一代”：出生于1946年至1964年的战后婴儿潮时期的人。
反对他们的理由是，他们享受了免费的高等教育和负担得起的住房，然后制造了巨额债务和气候变化的混乱局面，供其他所有人清理。
对“千禧一代”（指80年代初期至90年代中期出生的人）的指控是，他们杀死了从蛋黄酱到织物调理剂的所有东西，痴迷自拍照，并在鳄梨和吐司和燕麦拿铁上花了钱。
他们常常被贴上懒洋洋，自我迷恋的“雪花”的标签。千禧一代毫无疑问地面临着经济焦虑，生活成本日益高涨，就业前景pre可危，而婴儿潮一代则厌倦了将这些社会问题归咎于他们。
哦，然后是“ X世代”，坐在中间被人们遗忘了，还有“ Z世代”，它们是在社交媒体上成长的年轻人，他们刚刚加入竞争。

First, there are the “Boomers”: people born in the post-war baby boom between 1946 and 1964.
The case against them is that they’ve enjoyed free higher education and affordable housing, and then created the combined mess of enormous debts and climate change for everyone else to clean up.
The charges against “Millennials” – anyone born between the early 80s and mid-90s – is that they’ve killed off everything from mayonnaise to fabric conditioner, are obsessed with selfies, and fritter their money away on avocado on toast and oatmeal lattes.
They are often labelled as lazy, self-obsessed “snowflakes.”And where Millennials undoubtedly face economic anxiety with increasingly high living costs and precarious employment prospects, Boomers are sick of these societal issues being blamed on them.
Oh, and then there’s “Generation X”, sitting largely forgotten in the middle, and “Generation Z”, the youngsters raised on social media who are just entering the fray…

而且，由于自然是自然，汽油会随着时间的推移而降解-通常在三到六个月内消失。
波动性在各种情况下意味着很多事情，并且在很多情况下都与“易燃”混为一谈。
燃料箱装满后，最好的选择是倒入一些燃料稳定剂，以防止燃料蒸发和氧化长达两年，具体取决于制造商。
保持柴油车的油箱充满油，并考虑使用柴油稳定剂，以将水和氧化保持在最低水平。
如果您驾驶电动汽车，请趁此机会为汽车充满电并使其插电。

And, because nature is nature, petrol will degrade over time – generally anywhere from three to six months.
Volatility means a lot of things in various contexts, and has been conflated in a lot of cases with ‘flammable’.
The best bet, once you have a full fuel tank, is to pour in some fuel stabiliser, which protects the fuel against evaporation and oxidisation for up to two years, depending on the manufacturer.
Keep your diesel car’s tank brimmed, and consider a diesel fuel stabiliser, which keeps water and oxidation to a minimum.
If you drive an electric car, take this opportunity to fully charge your car and leave it plugged in.
