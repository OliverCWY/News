With social distancing and self-isolation becoming a part of all our lives, an alternative to meeting up in someone's living room is necessary.

On the plus side, this widens your potential invitation list - a friend in another town is just as able to join an online group as your next-door neighbour.

Book Riot's online bookclub guide runs through some of the options - they argue that a service like Google Hangouts is good for replicating the live group experience. (Other video chat applications are of course available - CNET's recent guide selects seven of their favourites).

But Book Riot also makes the point that things don't have to run quite the same way as IRL, for example starting a private group on Facebook or goodreads. This approach allows people to more easily read and comment (use spoiler warnings, obviously\!) at their own pace rather than to a pre-arranged deadline of a meet-up time.
