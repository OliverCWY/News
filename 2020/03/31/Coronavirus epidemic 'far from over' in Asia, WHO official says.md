MANILA – The world faces a long battle with the coronavirus pandemic, and even nations that have been gaining ground must not let their guard down, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday (March 31).

“This is a pandemic unlike the world has ever seen, and it has changed our system and put a strain on people’s lives… Let me be clear: the epidemic is far from over,” Dr Takeshi Kasai, WHO’s regional director for the Western Pacific, told reporters.

“It’s unlikely this virus will disappear next week or even next month,” he added. “This battle is going to be a long-term battle.”

He said even nations like Singapore, South Korea, Japan and China, which have seen cases of infections taper off, should not let their guard down.

Dr Matthew Griffith, a technical adviser to WHO, said Singapore in particular was now reporting more cases again.

“Most are imported cases. This is also a concern,” he said.

He added that outbreaks were popping up in new places, with smaller Pacific nations saddled with fragile health systems now the most vulnerable.

Places like Fiji still have to send their samples abroad, and that is hampered further by global travel restrictions, he said.

Dr Takeshi said measures like mass testing, cluster containment, early treatments, social distancing and lockdowns “buy us valuable time to prepare for large-scale community transmission”.

“But we need to be clear that even with all these measures, the risk will not go away, as long as the pandemic continues,” he said.

The confirmed number of cases worldwide continued to grow on Tuesday, nearing 800,000.
