唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）说，就冠状病毒爆发到高峰时可用的呼吸机数量而言，美国将处于“一个非常好的状态”。
美国有超过163,000例确诊病毒病例，超过3,000人死亡。
约翰·霍普金斯大学（Johns Hopkins University）称，纽约市是美国受灾最严重的地方，有914人被确认死亡。
由于该市面临超过33,000起案件，纽约市禁止了不必要的聚会，大多数企业也被关闭。
周日早些时候，特朗普先生指责某些州的医院“ ho积”呼吸机，口罩和其他重要医疗用品。

Donald Trump has said the US will be in "a very good shape" in terms of the number of ventilators available by the time the coronavirus outbreak peaks.
The US has more than 163,000 confirmed virus cases and over 3,000 deaths.
New York City is the worst-hit place in the US, with 914 confirmed fatalities, according to Johns Hopkins University.
Non-essential gatherings in New York City are banned and most businesses are closed as the city faces more than 33,000 cases.
Earlier on Sunday, Mr Trump accused hospitals in some states of "hoarding" ventilators, face masks and other critical medical supplies.

Employees were told in an email this "would allow us to fly through even the worst of potential future scenarios".
Staff will also be offered "enhanced voluntary leave and early retirement options".
Under the massive $2.2tn coronavirus relief bill passed by the US Congress last week, $50bn was set aside for airlines with half given as grants.
American Airlines, the world's biggest by passenger numbers, said it hoped to be back to flying a full schedule by then.

由于冠状病毒大流行导致原油需求暴跌，石油价格已跌至2002年以来的最低水平。
在过去一个月中，随着公司削减或关闭生产，石油价格下跌了一半以上。
该决定之所以发布，是因为世界各地的炼油厂正在加工更少的原油。
生产者感受到的最大影响油价暴跌预示着每升1英镑的汽油将重返市场。
较低的油价通常是通过补油的价格或较低的生活成本来实现的，对英国经济的提振。

在这些奇怪的日子里，社交媒体上流露出一种轻松的情绪：“不要给您的前任发短信”。
新的HBO系列Run正是利用这种普遍的神经症-充满幽默感和情感力量。
（也许更令人惊讶的是，她在《 Run》中饰演的客串是中西部动物标本剥制者和好撒玛利亚人。）
Run确实的确以ex的文字开头。
Run是她才华横溢的真正工具，这在一定程度上吸引了她的注意力，展示了她的多维才能。

In these strange days, one light-hearted refrain has rung out across social media: “don’t text your ex”.
It is this universal neurosis that new HBO series Run taps into – with both comic nuance and emotional force.
(Though more surprising perhaps is her acting cameo in Run as a Midwestern taxidermist and good Samaritan).
Run does indeed begin with a text from an ex.
Run is a real vehicle for her talents, which gives her the spotlight in a part that showcases her gift for multi-dimensionality.

可移动的别具一格的租赁植物“现房是一所房子，无论是否租用，”现居纽约的27岁房客切尔西·布朗（Chelsey Brown）说。
例如，我一直想在家中使用墙板，因此想出了一种安装临时护墙板的方法。
此外，我一直梦想拥有一个白色的大理石厨房，并通过使用可移动的粘手式产品在自己的租金中实现了这种外观。补充。
布朗目前正在为出租人开发一系列可移动产品，例如粘滞地板砖和可移动后挡板，其灵感来自于她对出租物业进行大修的经验。

In the UK this is even lower, with just 34% of people in the same age group owning property (compared to 55% in 1996).
Removable chic, rental plants“A house is a home whether it’s rented or not,” says renter Chelsey Brown, 27, who resides in New York.
For example, I’ve always wanted wall panelling in my home and so I figured out a way to install temporary wainscoting.
Additionally, I’ve always dreamed of having a white, marble kitchen and I achieved that look in my own rental by using removable, peel-and-stick products.”For some young renters, personalising a home can come down to affordable, stylish additions.
Brown is currently working on a range of removable products for renters, such as stick-on floor tiles and removable back splashes inspired by her own experience of overhauling a rental property.
