It’s the South Korean coffee treat that seems to have – almost overnight – gained worldwide popularity. But is it as easy to make as it appears to be?

When you search out a recipe for something that looks this good and find it contains just three ingredients – all of which you probably have in the cupboard – you feel like you’ve won the jackpot, right?

That’s why, over the last few days, people have been sharing their attempts (especially on TikTok) at making Dalgona coffee. A whipped drink that consists of:

Instant coffee granules – yep, got them in stock

Water – yes, there’s the tap for that

Sugar – we’re always baking so, yes to that too

Somehow (don’t question us – yet – on the chemistry of it all), if you mix two tablespoons of each ingredient and then start whipping it, eventually the dark watery paste turns into a thick whipped cream-esq mixture, which you can add to cold or hot milk for an iced coffee or latte-style treat.

But is it as easy as it looks? We tried it out.
