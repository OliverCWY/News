危机初期，特朗普说：“我们完全控制了它。
特朗普总统声称对森林管理到无人机等众多主题都拥有广泛的知识。
在这场危机之前，特朗普一直以惊人的一致性避免问责。
历史学家将最终写成书，详细介绍新闻记者在大流行病袭来时对特朗普政府失职的了解。
历史对特朗普总统的评估也是如此。

Early in the crisis, Trump said "We have it totally under control.
And President Trump has claimed to have extensive knowledge on a vast array of topics from forest management to drones.
Until this crisis, Trump had avoided accountability with remarkable consistency.
Historians will eventually write books detailing what journalists already know about the Trump administration's dereliction of duty when the pandemic hit.
The same is true for history's assessment of President Trump.

在美国，至少有160,698例冠状病毒病例是通过美国公共卫生系统检测和测试的。
星期一有500多起死于冠状病毒的报告，在美国一天之内死亡报告最多。
周一报道，在冠状病毒危机期间，美国报告的每五例死亡中，几乎有一例报告。
白宫冠状病毒反应协调员黛博拉·伯克斯（Deborah Birx）博士说，美国人遵守社会疏远的程度如何可能导致100,000例死亡和数百万例死亡。
“这意味着您被感染的可能性，而在其他州，带回冠状病毒的可能性可能要比我们州高。

There have been at least 160,698 cases of coronavirus that have been detected and tested in the United States through US public health systems.
There were more than 500 reports of deaths from coronavirus on Monday, the most death reports in a single day in the United States.
Almost one out of every five US deaths reported during the coronavirus crisis was reported Monday.
How well Americans obey social distancing could make the difference between 100,000 and millions of deaths, said Dr. Deborah Birx , the White House's coronavirus response coordinator.
"What it means is your likelihood of getting infected and potentially bringing back the coronavirus may be greater in other states than ours.

冠状病毒的死亡率低于先前的估计，考虑了往往未被诊断的可能较轻的病例，但仍远高于被流感杀死的人的0.1％。
如果不考虑未发现的感染，《柳叶刀》研究发现冠状病毒死亡率为1.38％，这与先前的报道更为一致。
该研究表明，对于年龄小于40岁的年龄组，死亡率从未高于0.16％。
在那些死于该病毒的人中，死亡始于人们开始出现症状后约18天。
迈阿密大学数学教授阮仕贵在研究中附带的一篇文章中强调指出，“在流行期间实时估计冠状病毒的死亡率非常具有挑战性”。

That coronavirus death rate, which is lower than earlier estimates , takes into account potentially milder cases that often go undiagnosed -- but it's still far higher than the 0.1% of people who are killed by the flu.
When undetected infections aren't taken into account, the Lancet study found that the coronavirus death rate was 1.38%, which is more consistent with earlier reports.
For age groups younger than 40, the death rate was never higher than 0.16%, according to the study.
Among those who succumbed to the virus, death came about 18 days after people started showing symptoms.
In an article accompanying the research, Shigui Ruan, a professor of mathematics at the University of Miami, emphasized that estimating the coronavirus death rate "in real time during its epidemic is very challenging."

（CNN商业新闻）亚马逊在工人罢工中抗议该公司对新型冠状病毒的反应后，已终止了该公司位于纽约州史坦顿岛仓库的一名员工。
亚马逊AMZN在周一晚上证实了解雇的消息，并在CNN Business的一份声明中告诉员工，克里斯蒂安·史密斯（Christian Smalls）应该被隔离。
“尽管有留下工资的指示，他今天还是在3月30日到现场，使车队处于危险之中。”
此次射击是在Smalls组织的抗议活动之前进行的，Smalls曾呼吁亚马逊关闭史坦顿岛的设施，以便在出现多例冠状病毒的情况下进行深层清洁。
在周日的一次采访中，斯莫斯告诉美国有线电视新闻网，他在过去的一周中一直试图说服高级仓库官员关闭建筑物并对其进行消毒，但无济于事。

(CNN Business) Amazon has terminated an employee based in the company's Staten Island, New York, warehouse after he participated in a worker walkout protesting the company's response to the novel coronavirus.
Amazon AMZN confirmed the firing Monday night, telling CNN Business in a statement that the employee, Christian Smalls, was supposed to be under quarantine.
"Despite that instruction to stay home with pay, he came onsite today, March 30, putting the teams at risk."
The firing follows the protest partly organized by Smalls, who had called on Amazon to shut down the Staten Island facility for deep cleaning after multiple cases of the coronavirus emerged there.
In an interview on Sunday, Smalls told CNN he had spent the past week trying to persuade senior warehouse officials to close the building and sterilize it, but to no avail.

美国汽油需求可能暴跌一半以上。可怕的警告表明，噩梦不会在能源市场很快结束。
全球石油需求波动系数为1。
高盛（Goldman Sachs）大宗商品负责人杰弗里·柯里（Jeffrey Currie）称其为“我们一生中最大的经济冲击”，并警告称，这对油价“极为不利”。
这导致了油价的历史性崩溃-与稳定动荡的市场所需的恰恰相反。
通常，较低的能源价格对美国司机，航空公司和其他能源消费者来说是个好消息。

US gasoline demand could collapse by more than halfThat dire warning suggests the nightmare won't end anytime soon for the energy market.
1 swing factor worldwide for oil demand.
Goldman Sachs head of commodities Jeffrey Currie called it the "largest economic shock of our lifetimes" and warned it is "extremely negative" for oil prices.
That caused an historic collapse in oil prices -- exactly the opposite of what was needed to stabilize the shaken market.
Ordinarily, lower energy prices would be great news for American drivers, airlines and other energy consumers.

As the event was streaming on Vimeo, an online video platform, it abruptly stopped.
"We had set up a site but the site crashed," Chopra said as he re-emerged shortly afterward on Facebook live.
Chopra's global event was set to begin at 12 p.m.
ET and meant to connect people's energy to heal the world at a time when we need it most, the event description says.

The man from Lakewood, Washington, hit two cars on separate occasions and failed to stop both times, leading state troopers on a high-speed chase up Interstate 5, the spokeswoman said.
The suspect was driving "absolutely recklessly," and a pursuit ensued at 109 miles an hour, she said.
One of the troopers attempted to corner the suspect's car, looked inside and realized a pit bull was sitting in the driver's seat while the suspect steered, Axtman said.
As he was trying to evade troopers, the suspect drove onto Centennial Trail, a trail for pedestrians and bicyclists in Snohomish County known for being busy, according to Axtman.

英国电影制片人李·舒尔曼（Lee Shulman）表示，这是他精选的新书《中世纪记忆：匿名项目》中的其中一张，汇集了300幅可追溯至1950年代的Kodachrome幻灯片。
Kodachrome幻灯片是装在纸板中的彩色反转片的矩形块，它们被装入幻灯片放映机中并投射到墙壁上。
自2017年以来，舒尔曼已收集了超过700,000张Kodachrome幻灯片，作为总部位于巴黎的非营利性计划Anonymous Project的一部分，该计划收集，扫描，数字化和分类自20世纪中叶以来生产的彩色负片和幻灯片。
这位电影制片人出于好奇并以很少的钱从eBay买了几把1950年代的Kodachrome盒子后开始收集幻灯片。
舒尔曼说，来自世界各地的人们都给他寄了几箱旧的Kodachrome幻灯片，其中一些在阁楼上已经被遗忘了多年。

British filmmaker Lee Shulman says it's one of his favorite images in " Midcentury Memories: The Anonymous Project ," a new book he curated that brings together 300 Kodachrome slides dating back to the 1950s.
Kodachrome slides are rectangular pieces of color reversal film encased in cardboard that were loaded into slide projectors and beamed onto walls.
Since 2017, Shulman has collected over 700,000 Kodachrome slides as part of The Anonymous Project, a Paris-based non-profit initiative that gathers, scans, digitizes and catalogs color photographic negatives and slides produced since the mid-20th century.
The filmmaker began collecting slides after buying a couple of 1950s Kodachrome boxes from eBay out of curiosity, and for very little money.
Shulman said people from all over the world have sent him boxes of old Kodachrome slides, some of which have been forgotten for years in their attics.

（CNN）将火星过去的故事拼凑在一起的最大谜团之一是一个关键问题：水从何而来？
一项新的研究表明，研究人员可能在掉落到地球的火星陨石的微小切片中找到了一个大线索。
幸运的是，火星陨石包含了行星地壳的样本。
地壳也是最大的水库位于火星的地方，占地表以下总水量的35％。
两种著名的陨石被称为“黑美人”和“艾伦·希尔斯”，研究人员研究了它们的薄片以观察火星的过去，包括行星的形成方式以及水何时进入方程式。

(CNN) One of the biggest mysteries in piecing together the story of Mars' past is a key question: Where did the water come from?
Researchers may have found a large clue in tiny slices from Martian meteorites that fell to Earth, according to a new study.
Fortuitously, Martian meteorites contain samples of the planet's crust.
The crust is also where the largest reservoir is estimated to be on Mars, containing 35% of the total estimated water beneath the surface.
The two well-known meteorites are known as Black Beauty and Allan Hills, and researchers studied thin slices of them to look into Mars' past, including how the planet formed and when water entered into the equation.

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
后来空袭被认为是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

Mjøstårnet的高度达到280英尺，于去年开放后成为世界上最高的木材建筑。
长期倡导和设计木制建筑的建筑师Michael Green表示，“现在有很多东西在融合。”
Or Framework是位于俄勒冈州波特兰的一座雄心勃勃的148英尺高的木塔，在去年因成本担忧而被取消之前，该塔被设定为美国最高的木塔。
考虑到在2018年之前，俄勒冈州成为美国第一个允许使用18层木制建筑的州，而在美国，没有任何地方允许任何超过6层的建筑物，这一决定意义重大。
该组织表示，除了担心森林砍伐外，洒水喷头不能有效防止烈焰扩散到木结构建筑中。

Reaching 280 feet in height, Mjøstårnet became the world's tallest timber building upon opening last year.
According to architect Michael Green, a longstanding advocate for -- and designer of -- wooden buildings, there are "a whole bunch of things converging right now."
Or Framework, an ambitious 148-foot-tall timber tower in Portland, Oregon, that was set to be the USA's tallest wooden tower before was canceled amid cost concerns last year.
The decision is significant given that, before 2018, when Oregon became the first US state to allow 18-story wooden buildings, nowhere in America permitted anything higher than six.
In addition to concerns about deforestation, the group says sprinklers are ineffective at preventing blazes from spreading through wood buildings.
