世界卫生组织（WHO）周二（3月31日）表示，世界正面临着与冠状病毒大流行的漫长斗争，即使是已经取得进展的国家也不能放松警惕。
他说：“这场战斗将是一场长期的战斗。”他说，即使新加坡，韩国，日本和中国这样的国家已经看到感染病例逐渐减少，也不应放松警惕。
世卫组织的技术顾问马修·格里菲斯博士说，特别是新加坡现在再次报告了更多病例。
他补充说，新的地方爆发了疫情，较小的太平洋国家背负着脆弱的卫生系统，现在是最脆弱的国家。
他说：“但我们必须清楚，即使采取了所有这些措施，只要大流行继续下去，风险就不会消失。”

MANILA – The world faces a long battle with the coronavirus pandemic, and even nations that have been gaining ground must not let their guard down, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday (March 31).
“This battle is going to be a long-term battle.”He said even nations like Singapore, South Korea, Japan and China, which have seen cases of infections taper off, should not let their guard down.
Dr Matthew Griffith, a technical adviser to WHO, said Singapore in particular was now reporting more cases again.
He added that outbreaks were popping up in new places, with smaller Pacific nations saddled with fragile health systems now the most vulnerable.
“But we need to be clear that even with all these measures, the risk will not go away, as long as the pandemic continues,” he said.

由于他们的症状含糊不清，甚至可能不存在，因此每天上升的病例数与他们看起来的并不一样。
了解轻度病例可以帮助研究人员掌握该疾病的传播方式-疾病的传播方式以及已经传播的程度。
除发烧外，轻度冠状病毒的症状非常模糊，如果人们感觉正常，则可能无法测量。
他们是否没有症状，是否有症状前或症状较轻并不重要。
这就是为什么仅仅告诉人们如果他们感到不适就留在家里是不够的-不仅仅是因为每个人对“病”的定义都不同，而且因为人们在感到不适之前就具有传染性，而有些人可能根本没有感到不适。

Since their symptoms are vague and possibly non-existent, the case numbers that climb by the day aren't what they seem.
Understanding the mild cases can help researches get a handle on the spread of the disease - how it's spreading and how widespread it's already become.
The symptoms of mild coronavirus are pretty vague except for the fever, which people might not measure if they feel normal.
Whether they had no symptoms, were pre-symptomatic or had mild symptoms isn't important.
That's why telling people to stay home if they feel sick isn't enough - not just because everyone defines "sick" differently, but because people are contagious before they feel sick, and some may not feel sick at all.
