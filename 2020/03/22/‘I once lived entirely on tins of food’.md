Jack advises that you allow yourself plenty of time to learn to cook. After cooking a disastrous lamb stew for the father of her child, she started to really pay attention to cooking. “If I cocked something up I would try to fix it and I would teach myself to cook. It took a month or so before I really hit my stride and then something clicked. No-one gets in a car and instinctively knows how to drive it\! I’ve got no embarrassment that I was an absolutely terrible cook in my teens, because I think we’ve established I’ve learned my way out of that\!”

It’s really important to find a recipe source you can trust, she says. She triple tests her recipes, “I understand that if you have no money you can’t risk trying something that might not work, because you can’t throw it in the bin and make something else. I’ve tried my best to make sure recipes are simple and delicious and that they work – I want to take that risk factor out for people.”
