考虑到世界卫生组织周三宣布冠状病毒已正式达到“大流行”状态，可以设想，过渡到“家庭办公室”对我们许多人来说将是新的常态。
但是，从建立良好的工作空间到与团队交谈的方式，有多种方法可以交付结果并避免疯狂。
加强沟通与否冠状病毒与否，在家工作的关键是与老板进行清晰的沟通-并确切了解您的期望。
波士顿东北大学管理学教授芭芭拉·拉尔森（Barbara Larson）说：“对于日常沟通，人们确实有明确的期望。”
“问问[您的经理]，如果他们不介意打个10分钟的电话就可以开始一天并结束一天。

And it’s realistic to assume that shifting to the ‘home office’ will become the new normal for many of us for a while, given Wednesday’s announcement by the World Health Organization that the coronavirus has officially reached ‘pandemic’ status.
But there are ways to deliver results and avoid going stir-crazy, from setting up a good workspace to the way you talk to your team.
Crank up the communicationCoronavirus or not, the key to working from home is clear communication with your boss – and knowing exactly what’s expected of you.
“Have really clear-set expectations for communications day to day,” says Barbara Larson, a professor of management at Northeastern University in Boston who studies remote working.
“Ask [your manager] if they don’t mind having a 10-minute call to kick off the day and wrap up the day.

随着Covid-19的蔓延，我们对表面的恐惧也随之蔓延。
与许多呼吸道病毒（包括流感）一样，Covid-19可以在感染者咳嗽时从被感染者的鼻子和嘴中释放出来的微小飞沫传播。
因此，尽管我们仍然不知道确切的原因是由受污染的表面直接造成多少例，但专家建议谨慎行事。

As Covid-19 has spread, so has our fear of surfaces.
Like many respiratory viruses, including flu, Covid-19 can be spread in tiny droplets released from the nose and mouth of an infected person as they cough.
So although we still don't know exactly how many cases are being caused directly by contaminated surfaces, experts advise exercising caution.

生命的证据科学家发现，这片被淹没的森林包含松树，al木，橡树和桦树树桩，由于沼泽中缺乏氧气和高碱性物质，这些树桩都得到了保存。
当该地区在大约4,000-5,000年前被海平面上升淹没时，活树逐渐因泥炭生长而变得涝渍。
随着水位上升，自然沉淀形成了厚厚的泥炭毯，树木停止生长并最终死亡。
在这里也发现了古老的动物骨头和一对鹿角，这表明这片土地曾经在海平面较低时以及该地区完全屈服于海洋之前繁荣昌盛。
由于存在人类住区的证据，该地区在媒体上通常被称为“威尔士亚特兰蒂斯”。

Evidence of lifeScientists have found that the submerged forest contains pine, alder, oak and birch tree stumps, which have all been preserved due to the lack of oxygen and high alkaline levels found in the bog.
The living trees became gradually waterlogged with peat growth when the area was inundated by rising sea levels some 4,000-5,000 years ago.
As the water level rose and a thick blanket of peat formed from natural sedimentation, the trees stopped growing and eventually died.
Old animal bones and a pair of deer antlers have been discovered here, too, suggesting that this stretch of land once flourished when the sea level was lower and before the area had completely succumb to the ocean.
Due to this evidence of human settlement, the area is often referred to as “the Atlantis of Wales” in the media.

在英国，这一比例甚至更低，只有34％的同一年龄段的人拥有财产（1996年为55％）。
可移动的别具一格的租赁植物“现房是一所房子，无论是否租用，”现居纽约的27岁房客切尔西·布朗（Chelsey Brown）说。
例如，我一直想在家中使用墙板，所以我想出了一种安装临时护墙板的方法。
此外，我一直梦想拥有一个白色大理石厨房，并通过使用可移动的剥离粘贴产品在自己的房屋中实现这种外观。”对于一些年轻的房客，个性化房屋可以归结为负担得起，时尚的住宅。补充。
布朗目前正致力于为承租人开发一系列可移动产品，例如粘地板砖和可移动后挡板，其灵感来自于她对出租物业进行大修的经验。

In the UK this is even lower, with just 34% of people in the same age group owning property (compared to 55% in 1996).
Removable chic, rental plants“A house is a home whether it’s rented or not,” says renter Chelsey Brown, 27, who resides in New York.
For example, I’ve always wanted wall panelling in my home and so I figured out a way to install temporary wainscoting.
Additionally, I’ve always dreamed of having a white, marble kitchen and I achieved that look in my own rental by using removable, peel-and-stick products.”For some young renters, personalising a home can come down to affordable, stylish additions.
Brown is currently working on a range of removable products for renters, such as stick-on floor tiles and removable back splashes inspired by her own experience of overhauling a rental property.

道格拉斯·费尔班克斯（Douglas Fairbanks）不仅是超人的灵感来源。
蝙蝠侠艺术家鲍勃·凯恩（Bob Kane）借鉴了更加险恶的电影传统，例如令人毛骨悚然的蝙蝠低语者。蝙蝠侠。
克莫德说：“ 1920年的《佐罗印记》（由费尔班克斯主演）的特色是英雄的经典寓言，这不仅影响了超人，还影响了蝙蝠侠，后者的漫画于1939年在报亭上映。
而他的艺术家鲍勃·凯恩（Bob Kane）则借鉴了更加险恶的电影传统，例如令人毛骨悚然的1930年之谜，《蝙蝠低语》及其无声的前身《蝙蝠》，甚至还带有著名的蝙蝠信号版本。
“秘密身份的惯例可以追溯到佐罗（Zorro）和猩红皮珀尔（Scarlet Pimpernel）这样的人物，他们伪装成笨蛋，所以没人怀疑他们在报仇。”

And Douglas Fairbanks wasn't just an inspiration for Superman.
Batman artist Bob Kane drew on a more sinister cinematic tradition, such as the creepy The Bat WhispersWhen DC Comics' bosses were looking for another character to add to their roster alongside the Man of Steel, writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane came up with the Batman.
Kermode says: "1920’s The Mark of Zorro [starring Fairbanks] features the classic trope of a hero with a secret identity, which influenced not just Superman but Batman, whose comics hit newsstands in 1939.
And his artist, Bob Kane, drew on a more sinister cinematic tradition, such as the creepy 1930 mystery, The Bat Whispers and its silent precursor, The Bat, which even features a version of the famous Bat-signal.
"The convention of the secret identity goes back to characters like Zorro and the Scarlet Pimpernel, who posed as foppish idiots so no one suspected they were avenging outlaws."

杰克建议您给自己充裕的时间学习烹饪。
在为孩子的父亲烹制了灾难性的炖羊肉后，她开始真正地重视烹饪。
“如果我把东西塞好，我会尝试修复它，然后我会自学做饭。
我花了一个月左右的时间才真正迈出大步，然后才有东西点击。
我已尽力确保食谱既简单又美味，并且可以使用-我想将这种风险因素排除在人们之外。”

Jack advises that you allow yourself plenty of time to learn to cook.
After cooking a disastrous lamb stew for the father of her child, she started to really pay attention to cooking.
“If I cocked something up I would try to fix it and I would teach myself to cook.
It took a month or so before I really hit my stride and then something clicked.
I’ve tried my best to make sure recipes are simple and delicious and that they work – I want to take that risk factor out for people.”
