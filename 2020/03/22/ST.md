纽约（法新社）-周六（3月21日），全球将近10亿人被限制在家中使用，因为全球冠状病毒死亡人数超过12,000，美国各州已在欧洲范围内实施了留在家中的措施。
全世界的病毒死亡人数超过12,000，其中受灾最严重的意大利报告有793人的死亡人数创历史新高，总枪击人数超过4,800，西班牙报告新死亡人数激增了32％。
据法新社报道，目前将近十亿人被限制在全球35个国家的住房中，其中包括6亿人因政府的强制性封锁令而陷入困境。
意大利这个拥有6000万人口的国家目前占世界冠状病毒死亡人数的36％，其确诊感染病例的死亡率为8.6％，大大高于大多数其他国家。
刚果民主共和国，芬兰，立陶宛和毛里求斯都在周六报告了第一例病毒死亡。

NEW YORK (AFP) - Almost one billion people were confined to their homes worldwide on Saturday (March 21) as the global coronavirus death toll topped 12,000 and US states rolled out stay-at-home measures already imposed across swathes of Europe.
The virus death toll surpassed 12,000 worldwide as worst-hit Italy reported a one-day record numbers of deaths at 793 - the overall total shot past 4,800 - and Spain reported a 32 percent spike in new deaths.
The nearly one billion people are now confined to their homes in 35 countries around the world - including 600 million hemmed in by obligatory government lockdown orders - according to an AFP tally.
Italy, a nation of 60 million now accounts for 36 percent of the world's coronavirus deaths and its death rate of 8.6 per cent among confirmed infections is significantly higher than in most other countries.
The Democratic Republic of Congo, Finland, Lithuania and Mauritius all reported their first virus deaths Saturday.

罗马（法新社，路透社）-意大利周四（3月21日）关闭了所有非必要业务，直到4月3日，该国记录了另一起创纪录的冠状病毒死亡人数，致死人数达到4,825人，占全球死亡人数的三分之一，并提醒人们大流行仍然无法控制。
这位现年55岁的意大利领导人强调，杂货店和药店将保持开放，并没有说明什么是“必不可少”的公司。
孔戴说：“我们将放慢该国的生产力，但我们不会停止它。”
意大利顶级医学专家说：“如果不遵循所有（政府）措施，那么一切都会变得更加困难。”
伦巴第州州长阿蒂里奥·丰塔纳（Attilio Fontana）引述意大利天空电视台TG24的话说：“情况正在恶化。”

ROME (AFP, REUTERS) - Italy on Saturday (March 21) shut all non-essential businesses until April 3 after recording another record coronavirus toll that brought its fatalities to 4,825 – over a third of the world’s total and a grim reminder that the pandemic remains out of control.
The 55-year-old Italian leader stressed that groceries and pharmacies would remain open and did not spell out what “indispensable” companies were.
“We will slow down the country’s productive engine, but we will not stop it,” Conte said.
"If you do not follow all the (government) measures, you make everything more difficult," Italy's top medical expert said.
"The situation is getting worse," Lombardy governor Attilio Fontana was quoted as saying late Saturday by Italy's Sky TG24.

冠状病毒关闭了航空旅行和旅游业，抑制了贸易，并迫使社会发生了变化，这使全球经济陷入困境。
对于一个已经在难以预测的燃料成本，过度监管，民族主义障碍和气候活动家的批评中挣扎的行业来说，冠状病毒是最残酷的打击，甚至可能是致命的打击。

伦敦（路透社）-英国周三（3月21日）敦促150万人被国民健康服务局（NHS）确定为如果感染冠状病毒以留在家中以保护自己，则有更高的严重疾病风险。
该国一直在加强与该病毒作斗争的措施，迄今为止，这些措施的严格性不如欧洲其他地方。
他们的医生将与他们联系，强烈建议他们在家里至少呆12周。
英国卫生部长汉考克（Matt Hancock）上周日表示，将对70岁以上的人进行自我隔离长达四个月的时间，使其免受病毒感染，并在“未来几周内”宣布这一消息。
它说：“已经在当地社区帮助当地抗灾力论坛和地方议会制定其冠状病毒应对计划的武装部队成员将支持这项努力，并且是应对这一危机的地方计划的核心。”

LONDON (REUTERS) - Britain on Saturday (March 21) urged 1.5 million people identified by the National Health Service (NHS) as being at higher risk of severe illness if they contract coronavirus to stay at home to protect themselves.
The country has been stepping up measures to fight the virus that have so far been less stringent than elsewhere in Europe.
They will be contacted by their doctor strongly advising them to stay at home for a period of at least 12 weeks.
British health minister Matt Hancock said last Sunday that people aged over 70 would be shielded from the virus by self-isolating for up to four months, with an announcement "in the coming weeks".
"Members of the armed forces, already in local communities helping Local Resilience Forums and local councils on their coronavirus response plans, will support this effort and are at the heart of local planning in response to this crisis," it said.

就在国内间谍局长发出警告称，来自右翼团体的威胁日益增加的几周后，澳大利亚警方就右翼极端分子涉嫌的阴谋发起了突袭行动。
该机构很少发表公开声明，近几个月来已经发布了两个有关右翼团体的警告。
工党议员克里斯蒂娜·肯尼利说，指定恐怖组织的标准应由议会情报和安全委员会审查。
“澳大利亚政府和所有联邦议员现在必须认真对待右翼极端主义的恐怖主义威胁，并作出适当反应。”
政府已表示，如果阿西欧（Asio）建议，它将考虑列出右翼团体。

Police in Australia have launched raids in connection with an alleged plot by a right-wing extremist, just weeks after the domestic spy chief issued a warning about the rising threat from right-wing groups.
The agency, which rarely makes public statements, has issued two warnings in recent months about right-wing groups.
Labor MP Kristina Keneally said the criteria for designating terror organisations should be reviewed by Parliament's intelligence and security committee.
"The Australian government and all federal parliamentarians must now take the terrorist threat of right-wing extremism seriously and respond appropriately."
The government has said it would consider listing right-wing groups if this was recommended by Asio.

马尼拉-当您已经非常了解的世界突然停止时，小东西被放大了千倍。
自本周以来，三分之一的菲律宾被封锁以检查极具传染性的冠状病毒的袭击，慢慢地变得很明显，至少在接下来的30天里，我们将不得不靠自己来解决。

MANILA - It's the small things that get magnified a thousandfold when the world that you have come to know so well suddenly stops.
Since a third of the Philippines was put in lockdown this week to check an onslaught by a very contagious coronavirus, it is slowly becoming apparent that, at least for the next 30 days, we will have to make it through mostly on our own.
Every tradesman we have come to rely on to keep our houses and cars together - plumbers, electricians, mechanics - are staying home.
She said her boss told her she did not have to come in if she was not able to get a ride.
Policemen and navy men have been guarding this checkpoint along Coast Road, in Paranaque city, south of Manila, since a third of the Philippines was put in lockdown a week ago.
