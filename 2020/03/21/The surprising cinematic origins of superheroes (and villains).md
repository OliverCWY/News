And Douglas Fairbanks wasn't just an inspiration for Superman.

Batman artist Bob Kane drew on a more sinister cinematic tradition, such as the creepy The Bat Whispers

When DC Comics' bosses were looking for another character to add to their roster alongside the Man of Steel, writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane came up with the Batman.

Kermode says: "1920’s The Mark of Zorro [starring Fairbanks] features the classic trope of a hero with a secret identity, which influenced not just Superman but Batman, whose comics hit newsstands in 1939.

"Unlike the colourful Superman, Batman was a darker figure, a costumed vigilante with no actual superpowers, who set out to strike fear in the hearts of his enemies. And his artist, Bob Kane, drew on a more sinister cinematic tradition, such as the creepy 1930 mystery, The Bat Whispers and its silent precursor, The Bat, which even features a version of the famous Bat-signal.

"The convention of the secret identity goes back to characters like Zorro and the Scarlet Pimpernel, who posed as foppish idiots so no one suspected they were avenging outlaws."
