吉隆坡（彭博社）-马来西亚反对党领袖安瓦尔·易卜拉欣说，在两个政治强国之间达成一系列违背诺言之后，他不再相信前总理马哈蒂尔·穆罕默德。
安瓦尔先生与马哈蒂尔博士之间的冲突可以追溯到1990年代，当时安瓦尔先生担任马哈蒂尔博士的代表，被视为他的继任者。
但是马哈迪（Mahathir）博士于1998年解雇了安华（Anwar）先生，随后他因滥用职权和鸡奸而被判入狱六年。
安瓦尔表示，马哈迪博士“看上去很真诚”，在2018年全国大选前夕在监狱和法院里拜访了他。
在2018年大选中获胜后，安瓦尔获得了王室赦免，并被释放出狱。

KUALA LUMPUR (BLOOMBERG) - Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim said he no longer believes former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad following a series of broken promises between the two political stalwarts.
The conflict between Mr Anwar and Dr Mahathir has dated way back to the 1990s, when Mr Anwar served as Dr Mahathir's deputy and was seen as his successor.
But Dr Mahathir fired Mr Anwar in 1998, and then he spent the next six years in prison on convictions for abuse of power and sodomy.
Mr Anwar said Dr Mahathir "seemed quite sincere", visiting him in jail and courthouse in the run-up to the 2018's national election.
After the 2018's election victory, Mr Anwar received a royal pardon and was freed from jail.

## 冠状病毒：恐慌性购买，封锁可能会推动世界粮食通胀

粮农组织资深经济学家和农业分析师表示，尽管主要出口国有大量谷物和油料籽供应，但由于冠状病毒大流行而导致的禁闭和恐慌性食品购买可能会引发世界粮食通货膨胀。
联合国粮食及农业组织（粮农组织）首席经济学家阿卜杜勒扎·阿巴斯安先生说：“您所需要的只是从磨坊主或政府等大型进口商那里紧急购买，以制造危机。”
那可能导致全球粮食供应危机。”
但是，根据美国农业部（USDA）的估计，到6月作物销售年度结束时，全球小麦库存预计将从去年的2.775亿吨增加到2.814亿吨。
预计世界稻米库存为1.823亿吨，而一年前为1.753亿吨。

SINGAPORE (REUTERS) - Lockdowns and panic food buying due to the coronavirus pandemic could ignite world food inflation even though there are ample supplies of staple grains and oilseeds in key exporting nations, a senior FAO economist and agricultural analysts said.
"All you need is panic buying from big importers such as millers or governments to create a crisis," said Mr Abdolreza Abbassian, chief economist at the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).
That is what could lead to a global food supply crisis."
However, global wheat stocks at the end of the crop marketing year in June are projected to rise to 287.14 million tonnes, up from 277.57 million tonnes a year ago, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates.
World rice stocks are projected at 182.3 million tonnes as compared with 175.3 million tonnes a year ago.
