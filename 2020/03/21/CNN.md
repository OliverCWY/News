尽管俄罗斯与中国有着漫长的边境线，并在今年1月记录了第一例病例，但确诊的俄罗斯冠状病毒病例数却令人惊讶地低。
人数正在增加，但俄罗斯这个拥有1.46亿人口的国家，确诊病例少于卢森堡，只有253人被感染。
相比之下，根据《 CIA世界概况》的统计，卢森堡的人口仅为628,000，截至周六，该国已报告670例冠状病毒病例，其中8人死亡。
测试方面的良好记录“世卫组织总干事说'测试，测试，测试'。”世界卫生组织驻俄罗斯代表梅利塔·武伊诺维奇博士周四对CNN说。
一些专家对俄罗斯的测试系统的可靠性提出了疑问，该系统取决于一个实验室。

The number of confirmed Russian coronavirus cases is surprisingly low, despite Russia sharing a lengthy border with China and recording its first case back in January.
The numbers are picking up, but Russia -- a country of 146 million people -- has fewer confirmed cases than Luxembourg, with just 253 people infected.
Luxembourg, by contrast, has a population of just 628,000, according to the CIA World Factbook , and by Saturday had reported 670 coronavirus cases with eight deaths.
A strong record on testing"The director-general of WHO said 'test, test, test,'" Dr. Melita Vujnovic, the World Health Organization's representative in Russia, told CNN Thursday.
And some experts have raised doubts about the reliability of Russia's testing system, which depends on a single laboratory.

医生给国会的信中没有详细说明国土安全部官员如何回应他们提出的担忧。
在此之前，其中一位医生已经提出了对危险拘留条件的担忧。这不是艾伦第一次向国会致函，证明他对ICE拘留条件的担忧。
医生写道，国土安全部至少应“考虑释放所有被拘留者到老年人和慢性病患者等高风险医疗团体中。”

"Currently, no ICE detainees or other staff are symptomatic for COVID-19 at this facility," ICE said in a statement obtained by CNN.

The doctors' letter to Congress does not detail how DHS officials responded to the concerns they raised.
One of the doctors has raised concerns about dangerous detention conditions beforeThis isn't the first time Allen has sent a letter to Congress documenting his concerns over conditions in ICE detention.
At minimum, DHS "should consider releasing all detainees in high risk medical groups such as older people and those with chronic diseases," the doctors write.

但是来自世界其他国家的强劲需求造成了流动性紧缩-本质上是美元短缺。
贾克斯补充说：“他们不欠美国人这些钱没关系……重要的是他们现在需要美元，现在需要美元。”
美联储周五宣布进一步计划，以增加与加拿大银行，英格兰银行，日本银行，欧洲中央银行和瑞士国家银行的美元掉期频率。
强势美元使美国出口商品的价格比外国制造商品的价格更高，因此竞争力也更差。
美元走强也有好处。美元的需求也是一个良好的心理迹象。

But this strong demand from other countries around the world has created a liquidity crunch -- essentially a dollar shortage.
"It doesn't matter that they don't owe these dollars to Americans...what matters is that they need dollars and need them now," Juckes added.
The Fed announced further plans Friday to step up the frequency of dollar swaps with The Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank.
A strong dollar makes US exports more expensive -- and therefore less competitive -- than foreign made goods.
Benefits to a strong dollar as wellStill, the demand for the dollar is also a good psychological sign.

"When people go out and look at the night sky, myself included, it can be overwhelming to be faced with a bunch of science," Eaves said.
On Thursday, she discussed Sirius , the brightest star in the night sky.
The Virtual Telescope Project , for example, offers tours of the cosmos and images of thesky in real-time to everyone in the world.
We can have a shared collective experience and know that we're all looking up at the same night sky, that we're not alone, that we're not isolated.

在星期四晚上的一条推文中，洛夫勒声称她和她的丈夫都没有意识到股票上涨直到他们开始三个星期后的2月16日。
伯尔已要求参议院道德委员会审查其销售情况，当被问及是否会做同样的事情时，洛夫勒（Loeffler）不会在周五发表评论。
周四晚上，保守的福克斯新闻的主持人塔克·卡尔森（Tucker Carlson）呼吁伯尔（Burr）更全面地解释他的交易或辞职。
从某种意义上说，伯尔和洛夫勒是否犯下了任何实际的罪行-再次，目前没有证据表明他们犯了罪。
Burr和Loeffler需要了解这一切对普通人的看法，如果他们想度过难关。

In a tweet Thursday night, Loeffler claimed that neither she nor her husband were aware of the stock moves until February 16, three weeks after they began.
Burr has asked the Senate Ethics Committee to review his sales, Loeffler wouldn't comment Friday when asked if she would do the same thing.
On Thursday night, conservative Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson called on Burr to explain his transaction more fully or resign.
Whether or not Burr and Loeffler committed any actual crime -- and, again, there's no current evidence they did -- is in some ways beside the point.
And Burr and Loeffler need to understand how this all looks to the average person if they want to get through it.

这些标志性图像都有一个共同的线索：粉红色。
“粉红色作为西方提出的脆弱女性气质的代名词，已有150年的历史了。
当时，粉红色不被视为“女孩”色-男女婴儿都穿着白色。
粉色从奢侈到工人阶级，从那时到妓女通常穿着的颜色，从精致到粗俗。
“但是我确实认为粉红色是最具争议的粉红色之一，也是最具分裂性的粉红色之一。

These iconic images all share a common thread: the color pink.
"The 150-year-old notion of pink as synonym with fragile femininity brought forward by the West is being challenged.
Pink was not then considered a "girls" color -- infants of both sexes were dressed in white.
Pink went from luxury to working-class and, as a color often worn by prostitutes at the time, from sophisticated to vulgar.
"But I do think that pink is one of the most controversial ones -- and one of the most divisive, too.

（CNN）甚至吉米·法伦（Jimmy Fallon）在抚养孩子的时候也不得不努力在家工作。
“今晚节目”主持人采访了詹妮弗·加纳，这是他每天10分钟的“在家版”部分的一部分。
但是，当他准备与加纳（Garner）演奏她可信赖的萨克斯管二重奏时，法伦（Fallon）的女儿走进来向他提问。
“你得给我五分钟，芽，”法伦说。
加纳然后开玩笑说，当她进入另一个房间做这个部分时，她的三个孩子想加入。

(CNN) Even Jimmy Fallon is having to juggle working from home while raising his kids.
"The Tonight Show" host interviewed Jennifer Garner as part of his daily 10-minute "At Home Edition" segment.
But while he was gearing up to duet with Garner on her trusty saxophone, Fallon's daughter walked in to ask him a question.
"You've got to give me five minutes, bud," Fallon said.
Garner then joked that when she went into the other room to do the segment, her three kids wanted to join.

“隔离区地图”的第一天。
信用：富勒每天有两个星期，富勒从他590平方英尺的公寓内描绘了他的经历和想法。
结果是一系列名为“检疫图”的14张图纸。
在这张地图上，艺术家展示了绘制的边界，幽默地将与妻子共享的公寓划分为“他的位”和“她的位”。
富勒现在已无法进行检疫，但像世界上许多人一样，富勒的活动受到社会距离疏远的限制。

Fuller is now out of quarantine but, like many people around the world, his movements are limited by the need for social distancing.
