随着世界各地出现有关社会疏远和自我孤立的新建议，一些人可能会问到冠状病毒大流行对亲密关系意味着什么。
东英吉利大学（University of East Anglia）的医学专家保罗·亨特（Paul Hunter）教授试图解释英国政府最新建议对亲密关系的含义。
我们所有人都应远离不必要的与他人的接触，以阻止传播，而且我们知道接吻可以轻易传播病毒。
因此，如果您单身，最好避免约会一段时间-除非在安全距离内完成约会。
来自伦敦的25岁的希拉·霍普（Cilla Hope）在周四分享在线约会的经历时，引起了社交媒体的关注。

With new recommendations about social distancing and self-isolation coming in around the world, some may be asking what the coronavirus pandemic means for intimacy.
Prof Paul Hunter, an expert in medicine at the University of East Anglia, has tried to interpret what the latest UK government advice means for intimacy.
We all should be distancing ourselves from unnecessary contact with others, to help stop the spread, and we know kissing can easily spread the virus.
So if you're single, it's best you avoid dating for a while - unless it's done at a safe distance.
Cilla Hope, a 25-year-old from London, got social media attention when she shared her experience of an online date on Thursday.

罐装番茄也可以是整粒（李子番茄）和过筛（帕萨塔），但是这些选择通常比较昂贵，通用性较差。
番茄酱的诀窍是将它们煮得慢且慢-如果煮足够长的时间，即使是最便宜的番茄也能尝起来很棒。
食用油。
用途最广泛且价格适中的油是一种无味的油，例如植物油或葵花籽油。
像盐一样，胡椒可以增强其他成分的味道。

Tinned tomatoes also come whole (plum tomatoes) and sieved (passata), but these options are typically more expensive and less versatile.
The trick with tomato-based sauces is to cook them low and slow – even the cheapest tomatoes will taste great if you cook them for long enough.
Cooking oil.
The most versatile – and affordable – oil is a flavourless one such as vegetable oil or sunflower oil.
Like salt, pepper enhances the taste of other ingredients.

## 漂亮女人如何从故事中抹去性爱

### How Pretty Woman erased sex from its story

这是一部浪漫浪漫喜剧的肮脏前提，但这并不能阻止Pretty Woman成为1990年最受欢迎的喜剧之一。
在《漂亮女人》中，他没有接Vivian是因为他需要“放松”，而是因为他需要返回贝弗利威尔希尔酒店的路线。
相比较而言，《漂亮女人》的评论则较为审慎：这是一部有关性工作者的电影，主要针对随意性进行审查。
他们做了《漂亮女人》所做的事情，就是让观看者拿到客房服务的草莓并吃掉它们。
薇薇安（Vivian）谈论很多关于安全的性行为，这就是“漂亮女人”（Pretty Woman）的卖点：完全安全的性行为。

It’s a sordid premise for a feel-good romantic comedy, but that didn’t stop Pretty Woman being one of the biggest hits of 1990.
In Pretty Woman, he doesn’t pick up Vivian because he needs to “relax”, but because he needs directions back to the Beverly Wilshire hotel.
Pretty Woman is positively prudish in comparison: a film about a sex worker which is primly censorious about casual sex.
They do what Pretty Woman did, which is to let the viewer have their room-service strawberries and eat them, too.
Vivian talks a lot about safe sex, and that’s what Pretty Woman is selling: sex which is utterly safe.

But there are ways to deliver results and avoid going stir-crazy, from setting up a good workspace to the way you talk to your team.
Crank up the communicationCoronavirus or not, the key to working from home is clear communication with your boss – and knowing exactly what’s expected of you.
“Have really clear-set expectations for communications day to day,” says Barbara Larson, a professor of management at Northeastern University in Boston who studies remote working.

随着Covid-19的蔓延，我们对表面的恐惧也随之蔓延。
与许多呼吸道病毒（包括流感）一样，Covid-19可以在感染者咳嗽时从被感染者的鼻子和嘴中释放出来的微小飞沫传播。
因此，尽管我们仍然不知道确切的原因是由受污染的表面直接造成多少例，但专家建议谨慎行事。

As Covid-19 has spread, so has our fear of surfaces.
Like many respiratory viruses, including flu, Covid-19 can be spread in tiny droplets released from the nose and mouth of an infected person as they cough.
So although we still don't know exactly how many cases are being caused directly by contaminated surfaces, experts advise exercising caution.

生命的证据科学家发现，这片被淹没的森林包含松树，al木，橡树和桦树树桩，由于沼泽中缺乏氧气和高碱性物质，这些树桩都得到了保存。
当该地区在大约4,000-5,000年前被海平面上升淹没时，活树逐渐因泥炭生长而变得涝渍。
随着水位上升，自然沉淀形成了厚厚的泥炭毯，树木停止生长并最终死亡。
在这里也发现了古老的动物骨头和一对鹿角，这表明这片土地曾经在海平面较低时以及该地区完全屈服于海洋之前繁荣昌盛。
由于存在人类住区的证据，该地区在媒体上通常被称为“威尔士亚特兰蒂斯”。

Evidence of lifeScientists have found that the submerged forest contains pine, alder, oak and birch tree stumps, which have all been preserved due to the lack of oxygen and high alkaline levels found in the bog.
The living trees became gradually waterlogged with peat growth when the area was inundated by rising sea levels some 4,000-5,000 years ago.
As the water level rose and a thick blanket of peat formed from natural sedimentation, the trees stopped growing and eventually died.
Old animal bones and a pair of deer antlers have been discovered here, too, suggesting that this stretch of land once flourished when the sea level was lower and before the area had completely succumb to the ocean.
Due to this evidence of human settlement, the area is often referred to as “the Atlantis of Wales” in the media.

杰克建议您给自己充裕的时间学习烹饪。
在为孩子的父亲烹制了灾难性的炖羊肉后，她开始真正地重视烹饪。
“如果我把东西塞好，我会尝试修复它，然后我会自学做饭。
我花了一个月左右的时间才真正迈出大步，然后才有东西点击。
我已尽力确保食谱既简单又美味，并且可以使用-我想将这种风险因素排除在人们之外。”

Jack advises that you allow yourself plenty of time to learn to cook.
After cooking a disastrous lamb stew for the father of her child, she started to really pay attention to cooking.
“If I cocked something up I would try to fix it and I would teach myself to cook.
It took a month or so before I really hit my stride and then something clicked.
I’ve tried my best to make sure recipes are simple and delicious and that they work – I want to take that risk factor out for people.”

道格拉斯·费尔班克斯（Douglas Fairbanks）不仅是超人的灵感来源。
蝙蝠侠艺术家鲍勃·凯恩（Bob Kane）借鉴了更加险恶的电影传统，例如令人毛骨悚然的蝙蝠低语者。蝙蝠侠。
克莫德说：“ 1920年的《佐罗印记》（由费尔班克斯主演）的特色是英雄的经典寓言，这不仅影响了超人，还影响了蝙蝠侠，后者的漫画于1939年在报亭上映。
而他的艺术家鲍勃·凯恩（Bob Kane）则借鉴了更加险恶的电影传统，例如令人毛骨悚然的1930年之谜，《蝙蝠低语》及其无声的前身《蝙蝠》，甚至还带有著名的蝙蝠信号版本。
“秘密身份的惯例可以追溯到佐罗（Zorro）和猩红皮珀尔（Scarlet Pimpernel）这样的人物，他们伪装成笨蛋，所以没人怀疑他们在报仇。”

And Douglas Fairbanks wasn't just an inspiration for Superman.
Batman artist Bob Kane drew on a more sinister cinematic tradition, such as the creepy The Bat WhispersWhen DC Comics' bosses were looking for another character to add to their roster alongside the Man of Steel, writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane came up with the Batman.
Kermode says: "1920’s The Mark of Zorro [starring Fairbanks] features the classic trope of a hero with a secret identity, which influenced not just Superman but Batman, whose comics hit newsstands in 1939.
And his artist, Bob Kane, drew on a more sinister cinematic tradition, such as the creepy 1930 mystery, The Bat Whispers and its silent precursor, The Bat, which even features a version of the famous Bat-signal.
"The convention of the secret identity goes back to characters like Zorro and the Scarlet Pimpernel, who posed as foppish idiots so no one suspected they were avenging outlaws."
