With new recommendations about social distancing and self-isolation coming in around the world, some may be asking what the coronavirus pandemic means for intimacy.

Experts say there is no evidence yet that Covid-19 can be spread sexually but we already know the respiratory illness can transmit through close or direct contact with those who have it.

Prof Paul Hunter, an expert in medicine at the University of East Anglia, has tried to interpret what the latest UK government advice means for intimacy.

He says that if you and your partner have no symptoms there appears to be no reason to avoid sex, but it is probably best to abstain from it and other forms of close contact if anyone feels poorly - especially if one of you is particularly high risk.

Prof Hunter and other experts agree that, right now, everyone should be avoiding having sex with anyone who is not a regular partner in their immediate household.

In fact, Public Health officials in New York have issued new specific advice for what sexual activity they deem safe and unsafe (this page contains details that may not be suitable for younger readers).

We all should be distancing ourselves from unnecessary contact with others, to help stop the spread, and we know kissing can easily spread the virus.

So if you're single, it's best you avoid dating for a while - unless it's done at a safe distance. Cilla Hope, a 25-year-old from London, got social media attention when she shared her experience of an online date on Thursday.
