These six superhero staples should be in every store cupboard.

Tinned tomatoes. Chopped tomatoes are a staple ingredient of many popular recipes – including pasta sauces, curries, soups and chilli con carne. Tinned tomatoes also come whole (plum tomatoes) and sieved (passata), but these options are typically more expensive and less versatile. The trick with tomato-based sauces is to cook them low and slow – even the cheapest tomatoes will taste great if you cook them for long enough. If you like Italian food, consider buying tomatoes flavoured with garlic or basil as they make last-minute sauces super-easy, even if you’re out of garlic.

Stock is used in stews, curries, rice dishes, soups and gravy. It will add extra flavour to couscous and other grains. The cheapest form of stock is cubes. Similar products include jelly pots and concentrated stock in bottles – these are more expensive, but some people prefer the taste. Some readymade stocks are very salty, so choose low-sodium varieties if you are watching your salt intake. If you know a butcher who’ll give you bones for free, you can make your own stock. It takes time, but there’s very little work involved and it can be frozen in batches.

Cooking oil. Many dishes require oil for cooking, but it doesn’t need to be anything fancy. In fact cheaper oils often do the job better. The most versatile – and affordable – oil is a flavourless one such as vegetable oil or sunflower oil. They don’t burn at high temperatures, so are suitable for frying, plus their mild flavour means they can even be used in baking – both for greasing tins and in recipes. Olive oil tastes good, but it’s expensive and has a low burning point, which makes it unsuitable for cooking at high temperatures. If you decide to treat yourself, reserve it for recipes that use it as a flavouring.

Salt. This most basic of seasonings will be required in most savoury recipes and many sweet ones. The aim is to use salt to enhance the other ingredients – not to make food taste salty. There are lots of different types of salt available, but for most people table salt (or coarse sea salt if you have a grinder) is all that's needed. Flaked sea salt is very popular with chefs because it dissolves easily and adds a crunch to finished dishes. If a recipe calls for flaked salt and you only have table salt available, use about half as much as the recipes states. Smaller crystals sit closer together, meaning each pinch contains more actual salt.

Pepper. Like salt, pepper enhances the taste of other ingredients. It adds a spicy warmth and is especially important when cooking creamy dishes and meat. Pepper should be added towards the end of cooking as it loses flavour when cooked. Black and white pepper can be used interchangeably, though they do have a slightly different flavour. Freshly ground pepper has more depth of flavour than ready-ground, so it’s worth investing in a pepper grinder if you don’t already have one. Whole peppercorns can also be much cheaper than ground pepper if you shop around.
