Friday night plans? Well if you’re in Singapore, you better make sure you keep one metre distance from others or you could be fined up to S$10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both.

The latest regulations went into effect at 11:59pm on Thursday.

This is a pretty typical approach by Singapore’s government to make sure people do what they’re told. Penalties work here. You can still head out to restaurants and cafes, as long as you practice these safe social distancing measures. Offices and schools are open too.

The strategy appears to be shaving off salami slice pieces off our social lives bit by bit, so even if it isn’t officially called a lockdown, it certainly feels like one.

How they will enforce these new rules though - is another question altogether. The government’s language on this is ambiguous: it says if you’re caught intentionally sitting next to each other closer than a metre then you could be in violation of the law. But how do you determine what’s intentional?

While Singapore has won plaudits internationally for its efforts to combat the coronavirus, at home many people are frustrated that schools have been kept open. Clusters of infections amongst staff at a pre-school and international school have raised concerns of wider spread of the disease in the community.
