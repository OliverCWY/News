他们说，有必要进一步监测野生穿山甲，以了解它们在未来传播给人类的风险中的作用。
林博士说，在走私的马来穿山甲中发现这种病毒提出了他们在何处感染该病毒的问题。
疫情爆发后，中国已采取行动禁止野生动物食用肉类。
“检测到的冠状病毒的来源确实是未知的-它可能是天然的穿山甲病毒，或者是在捕获和死亡之间从另一种物种中跳出来的。”
牛津大学的Dan Challender博士说，穿山甲已知携带多种冠状病毒。

And they say further surveillance of wild pangolins is needed to understand their role in the risk of future transmission to humans.
Finding the virus in smuggled Malayan pangolins raised the question of where they contracted the virus, said Dr Lam.
China has moved to ban the consumption of meat from wild animals in the wake of the outbreak.
"The source of the detected coronavirus really is unknown - it might have been a natural pangolin virus or have jumped from another species between capture and death."
And Dr Dan Challender, of the University of Oxford, said pangolins are known to host various strains of coronaviruses.

这两种信息都没有与公众一起被冲走，他们一起加重了人们对政府反应的不信任。
目的感在最近的历史中，新西兰总理雅辛达·阿德恩（Jacinda Ardern）对克赖斯特彻奇枪击事件做出的迅速而衷心的反应可能说明一位实现了这五个目标的领导人。
她继续修改该国的枪支法律，并因她的努力而在全球获得广泛好评。
关于冠状病毒，韩国的快速反应可能是有效危机管理原则的典范。
用布恩的话来说，该国已经建立了“感知”局势的基础设施。

Neither message washed with the public and together they only added to its distrust of the government’s response.
Sense of purposeIn recent history, the New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s swift and heartfelt reaction to the Christchurch shootings may illustrate a leader who met these five goals.
She went on to change the country’s gun laws and received widespread acclaim across the globe for her efforts.
Regarding the coronavirus, South Korea’s rapid response may be an exemplary demonstration of the principles of effective crisis management.
In Boin’s terms, the nation had already established the infrastructure for “sense making” of the situation.

She believes that the £36 package of 48 rolls, which was clearly labelled as toilet paper, was stolen.
Avant Garde Brands, which sells household products on Ebay and Wowcher, told one UK customer that it was starting to receive reports of toilet roll deliveries going missing too.

这是新加坡政府采用的一种非常典型的方法，可确保人们按照别人的指示去做。
只要您采取这些安全的社交疏导措施，您仍然可以前往餐馆和咖啡馆。
该策略似乎是在一点一点地减少我们的社交生活中的萨拉米香肠碎片，因此，即使没有正式将其称为“封锁”，也确实让人感觉很像。
尽管新加坡在抗击冠状病毒方面的努力赢得了国际赞誉，但国内许多人对学校的开放感到沮丧。
在一所学前班和国际学校的教职员工中，感染群已引起人们对该疾病在社区中更广泛传播的担忧。

This is a pretty typical approach by Singapore’s government to make sure people do what they’re told.
You can still head out to restaurants and cafes, as long as you practice these safe social distancing measures.
The strategy appears to be shaving off salami slice pieces off our social lives bit by bit, so even if it isn’t officially called a lockdown, it certainly feels like one.
While Singapore has won plaudits internationally for its efforts to combat the coronavirus, at home many people are frustrated that schools have been kept open.
Clusters of infections amongst staff at a pre-school and international school have raised concerns of wider spread of the disease in the community.

像国会一样，白宫也看到了即将到来的经济海啸-以及预示着什么。
尽管这是一个未知的领域，但一个在选举年初期处于经济动荡的国家对总统的政治希望构成了严重威胁。
不过，此举可能使特朗普能够将当前的经济痛苦归咎于某些责任。
总统的政治反对派已经在加强攻击，意识到他在处理病毒爆发方面存在长期脆弱性。
国会的一揽子援助计划是向个人提供一次性付款，并扩大了失业救济金，旨在减轻一些经济上的痛苦并避免大规模的动荡。

Like Congress, the White House has also seen the coming economic tsunami - and what it could portend.
While this is uncharted territory, a nation in economic turmoil early in an election year is a serious threat to a president's political hopes.
The move might allow Trump to deflect some of the blame for the ongoing economic pain, however.
Already the president's political opponents are sharpening their attacks, sensing a long-term vulnerability on his handling of the viral outbreak.
Congress's aid package, with its one-time payments to individuals and expanded unemployment benefits, is aimed at ameliorating some of the economic pain and avoiding massive unrest.

政府因在早期的经济措施中未能为自雇和自由职业者提供支持而受到批评。
与雇员计划不同，自雇人士在获得支持时可以继续工作。
代表许多自雇工人的小型企业联合会对此表示欢迎。他说：“虽然协议并不完美，但今天政府已经走了很长一段路。”
冠状病毒自营职业收入支持计划是另一项数十亿英镑的特殊支持，反映了旨在控制流感大流行的停产对经济的残酷影响。
在英国，尽管实际病例数可能要高得多，但现在已经有超过11,600人的冠状病毒检测呈阳性。

The government had faced criticism for failing to provide support for self-employed and freelance workers in its earlier package of economic measures.
Unlike the employee scheme, the self-employed can continue to work as they receive support.
The Federation of Small Business, which represents many self-employed workers, welcomed the intervention, saying: "Although the deal is not perfect, the government has moved a very long way today."
The Coronavirus Self-Employment Income Support scheme is another extraordinary, multi-billion pound support, reflecting the brutal economic impact of a shutdown designed to keep the pandemic in check.
In the UK, more than 11,600 people have now tested positive for coronavirus - although the actual number of cases is likely to be far higher.

Post offices are among a small group of "essential retailers" the government says are allowed to stay open during the the coronavirus outbreak.
"People are worried, but the managers say they are following government guidelines, that manufacturing can stay open.
I think they are worried they will lose business and that other factories will stay open.

该公司的创始人宣布该公司150,000名在中国的员工中有90％返回工作岗位后的一天，该公司就推出了P40手机。
与去年的机型不同，由于美国的贸易禁令，P40手机缺少Google服务-包括其YouTube，地图和Play商店应用以及Google Assistant。
AI智能手机新手机共有三个版本：屏幕为6.1英寸的标准P40，以及具有6.58英寸显示屏的较大的中档P40 Pro和高端Pro +。
为了弥补YouTube的损失，该公司创建了自己的华为视频应用程序。
P40和P40 Pro将于4月7日开始销售，起价分别为799欧元（742英镑，890美元）和999欧元，P40 Pro +将于6月发布，价格为1399欧元。

The firm unveiled the P40 phones a day after the firm's founder announced that 90% of the company's 150,000 China-based employees had returned to work.
Unlike last year's models, the P40 phones lack Google services - including its YouTube, Maps and Play Store apps, and the Google Assistant - because of a US trade ban.
AI smartsThere are three versions of the new phones: the standard P40, with a 6.1in screen, and a larger mid-range P40 Pro and high-end Pro+, which both have 6.58in displays.
To help make up for the loss of YouTube, the firm has created its own Huawei Video app.
The P40 and P40 Pro go on sale on 7 April, and start from €799 (£742, $890) and €999 respectively, The P40 Pro+ will be released in June, and is priced at €1,399.

If you ever wondered why Australians have such an obsession with the humble meat pie, this inculcation from a very young age is possibly at the heart of it.
Fast forward to the 21th Century and Australians eat an estimated 270 million meat pies every year – nearly 11 per person annually – according to statistics shared in the exhibition.
The Kuhn’s 2019 winning entry, a caramelised pork and pepper pie, went a step further and tapped into the pair’s Phnom Penh roots.
“I struggled a lot for at least two years.”When the opportunity for the brothers to buy the Kyneton pie business came about in 2016, they were hesitant.

街角小店也是流行文化的基石。
我们所知道的英国主要拐角店的历史可以追溯到维多利亚时代。英国首相玛格丽特·撒切尔（Margaret Thatcher）作为杂货店女儿的背景也可以用来做很多事情：街角小店代表着谦虚但坚固的贸易。

His corner shop opened 365 days a year, early until very late at night.
The corner shop is also a cornerstone of pop culture.
The staple British corner shop as we know it dates back to Victorian times; much would also be made of so-called ‘Iron Lady’ UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s background as a grocer’s daughter: the corner shop represented humble yet sturdy trade.
TV newsreader Babita Sharma’s book The Corner Shop is one evocative real-life account, of her own British Asian family running (and living above) a Reading shop.
The local shop frequently becomes a place of confessional, for both customers and owners.

办公室工作人员的不良卫生状况也会加剧这一情况：2019年英国的一项调查显示，只有61％的英国办公室工作人员上厕所后用温水和肥皂正确洗手。
空气中的病毒肮脏的手指和桌子是一回事，但病毒传播的最大风险是空气中传播的病毒。
“如果一个人生病了，他或她可以通过咳嗽和打喷嚏，触摸表面并紧密接触他人来传播细菌。
办公室的流通空气也可能导致微生物扩散。
这意味着要与生病或接触被感染表面的人接触，然后将其转移到家里的表面。

Poor hygiene from office workers can exacerbate to this, too: a 2019 UK survey showed that only 61% of UK office workers washed their hands properly with warm water and soap after going to the toilet.
A virus in the airDirty fingers and desks are one thing, but the biggest risk for the spread of virus is what’s travelling through the air.
“If one person is sick, he or she could spread the germs through coughing and sneezing, touching surfaces and contacting others closely.
The circulated air of offices can also contribute to the spread of microbes.
That means coming in contact with someone who is sick or touching an infected surface, then transferring it to your surfaces at home.

考克斯（Cox）对电视节目主持人吉米·金梅尔（Jimmy Kimmel）表示，她对自己在莫妮卡（Monica）连续十年演出的热门情景喜剧片所知甚少。
“人们非常喜欢这个节目，我决定暴饮暴食观看朋友……这真的很好！”
由于回忆模糊，考克斯说当人们要求她回答有关朋友的问题时，她感到压力很大。
她还确认，由于冠状病毒危机，2月宣布的期待已久的“朋友聚会”特别活动的拍摄已被推迟。

Cox told TV host Jimmy Kimmel she remembered very little about the hit sitcom in which she played Monica for a decade.
"People love the show so much, I decided to binge watch Friends... it's really good\!"
Due to her foggy recollection, Cox said she gets stressed out when people ask her to answer questions about Friends.
She also confirmed that filming for the long-awaited Friends reunion special, which was announced in February, has been postponed due to the coronavirus crisis.
