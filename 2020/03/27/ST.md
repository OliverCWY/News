TOKYO (REUTERS) - Queues formed at supermarkets and stores in Tokyo on Friday (March 27) as residents in the Japanese capital prepared for a weekend at home after the city's governor called on them to stay at home to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
After Governor Yuriko Koike's plea on Wednesday to refrain from non-essential, non-urgent outings through April 12, and especially this weekend, residents were stocking up on everything from instant noodles and rice to toiletries and fresh produce, despite public-service warnings against hoarding.
In one residential neighbourhood, more than a dozen people lined up for toilet paper at a local drug store.
One of them, an elderly woman, leaned on her walker as she held a 10,000-yen (S$131) note in her hand.
Tokyo has seen a surge in coronavirus cases this week, reporting a record 47 cases on Thursday for a total of 259.

北京（路透社）-中国大陆报告在三天之内首次感染本地传播的冠状病毒，并新增了54例进口病例，因为北京下令航空公司大幅削减国际航班，担心旅客可能会重新点燃冠状病毒的爆发。
国家卫生委员会在周五的一份声明中说，周四（3月26日）报告的55例新病例比一天前的67例有所下降。
目前中国大陆确诊病例为81,340例。
进口的冠状病毒病例，主要是中国国民返回家园，现在引起了当局的最大关注。
中国周四下令，当地航空公司仅保留前往任何国家的一条航线，并将从每周日开始的此类航线的航班限制为每周一次。

BEIJING (REUTERS) - Mainland China reported its first locally transmitted coronavirus infection in three days and 54 new imported cases, as Beijing ordered airlines to sharply cut international flights, fearing travellers could reignite the coronavirus outbreak.
The 55 new cases reported on Thursday (March 26) was down from 67 a day earlier, the National Health Commission said in a statement on Friday.
There are now 81,340 confirmed cases in mainland China.
Imported coronavirus cases, mostly Chinese nationals returning home, now pose the biggest concern for the authorities.
China on Thursday ordered local airlines to maintain only one route to any country and limit flights on such routes to one per week, effective from Sunday.

华盛顿（路透社）-美国消费者对鸡蛋的需求增加，导致鸡蛋价格在最近几周飞涨，因为由于冠状病毒关闭，消费者争相购买主食。
专家称，尽管一些杂货店尚未将较高的批发价格转嫁给消费者，但消费者价格也有所提高，尽管涨幅不及批发价格。
Urner Barry的主管Brian Moscoguiri表示，目前的批发价格飙升超过了2015年禽流感爆发期间的水平，这是由于需求增加所致。
“鸡蛋价格上涨是因为需求急剧上升。
拥有4000万只母鸡并控制着美国有壳蛋市场约20％的Cal-Maine Foods没有再三要求发表评论。

WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - Increased demand for eggs in the United States has sent egg prices soaring in recent weeks as consumers scramble to stock up on staples due to coronavirus shutdowns.
Consumer prices have also increased, although not quite as much as wholesale prices, experts said, since some grocery stores have not passed on the higher wholesale prices - at least for now.
Brian Moscoguiri, a director with Urner Barry, said the current spike in wholesale prices exceeded that seen in 2015 during the avian flu outbreak and was due to increased demand.
"Egg prices are up because demand is up sharply.
Cal-Maine Foods, which has over 40 million hens and controls about 20 per cent of the US shell egg market, did not return repeated requests for comment.

罗马（路透社）-希望意大利的冠状病毒流行病可能会在星期四遭受挫折，当时有数据显示，新病例和死亡人数都在上升，突显了遏制该病的难度。
病例数接近于大流行开始的中国记录的81,000例感染。
他说：“我认为两三天内我们将了解我们所采取的措施是否奏效。”
文森佐·德·卢卡（Vincenzo De Luca）写道：“在这一点上，伦巴第的悲剧真正有可能成为南方的悲剧。”
“我们正处于感染的大爆发期，我们可能无法控制。”

ROME (REUTERS) - Hopes that Italy's coronavirus epidemic might be in retreat suffered a setback on Thursday when data showed that both the number of new cases and deaths had ticked higher, underscoring how hard it is to halt the disease.
The number of cases is nudging close to the more than 81,000 infections recorded in China where the pandemic began.
"I think that in two or three days we will understand if the measures we have taken are working," he said.
"At this point there is the real prospect that Lombardy's tragedy is about to become the south's tragedy," Vincenzo De Luca wrote.
"We are on the cusp of a major expansion of infections that we might not be able to manage."

华盛顿—美国在星期四（3月26日）超过中国和意大利，成为确诊Covid-19病例最多的国家，与世界卫生组织先前的警告相一致，它有望成为新的大流行流行中心组织。
官方数字落后，但约翰·霍普金斯大学的追踪者记录，截至周四晚上，美国确诊病例数为85,400例，而《纽约时报》的总数为83,300例。
纽约都会区目前有超过一半的美国冠状病毒病例来自该地区，现在正遭受Covid-19病人激增和死亡的袭击。
但是伯克斯博士在星期四的新闻发布会上也向记者们保证，模型显示，有20％的人口可能受到感染，这些数据与数据不符。
“我非常希望她（伯克斯博士）是对的，因为可以避免很多痛苦。

WASHINGTON – The United States overtook China and Italy to become the country with the most confirmed Covid-19 cases on Thursday (March 26), putting it on course to become the new epicentre of the pandemic, in line with previous warnings from the World Health Organisation.
Official numbers lag behind, but a Johns Hopkins University tracker recorded the number of confirmed cases in the US at 85,400 as of Thursday night, while a New York Times tally totalled up to 83,300 cases.
The New York metropolitan area, where more than half of America’s coronavirus cases are coming from, is now experiencing a surge of Covid-19 patients and deaths.
But Dr Birx also reassured reporters at Thursday’s press conference that models showing that 20 per cent of the population could be infected were not matched by data.
“I desperately hope she (Dr Birx) is right, because much suffering will be avoided.

由于Covid-19大流行严重打击了全球航空旅行业，新加坡航空公司（SIA）计划筹集至多150亿美元，以应对重大财务挑战。
淡马锡目前拥有该航空公司约55％的股份，该公司已承诺将收购未认购的剩余股份和债券。
供股价格为每股3美元，较周三的最新交易价6.50美元折让约54％。
发行将以股东每持有两股现有股份中的三股供股为基础。
在这方面，新航将受益于增强的就业支持计划和增强的航空支持计划，这将减少其运营支出。

SINGAPORE - Singapore Airlines (SIA) aims to raise up to $15 billion amid major financial challenges due to the Covid-19 pandemic which has hit the global air travel sector badly.
Temasek, which now owns about 55 per cent of the airline, has pledged to take up any remaining shares and bonds that are not subscribed.
The rights shares will be offered at $3 per share, a discount of about 54 per cent from the last traded price of $6.50 on Wednesday.
The issue will be on the basis of three rights shares for every two existing shares held by shareholders.
In this regard, SIA will benefit from the enhanced Jobs Support Scheme and the enhanced Aviation Support Package which will reduce its operating expenditure.

亨格告诉众议院：“这是具有里程碑意义的一揽子计划，是对特殊情况的必要回应。”
额外的480亿美元几乎占政府2020年1060亿美元预算的一半。
衡先生称，抗灾预算专注于三个关键领域。
他补充说，作为与全球经济高度融合的开放经济，新加坡将受到全球金融冲击的深刻影响。
他说，他将此补充预算命名为“复原力预算”，以反映该国在面对这些挑战时保持复原力的决心。

Mr Heng told the House: "This is a landmark package, and a necessary response to a unique situation."
The additional $48 billion amounts to nearly half of the Government's $106 billion Budget for 2020.
The Resilience Budget, as Mr Heng calls it, focuses on three key areas, Mr Heng said.
As an open economy that is highly integrated with the global economy, Singapore will be deeply impacted by global financial shocks, he added.
He said he named this Supplementary Budget the "Resilience Budget" to reflect the country's determination to remain resilient in the face of these challenges.

由于冠状病毒大流行压倒了医护人员，人们甚至在入院前就已经死了。
伯纳乌医生在电话中说，重症监护病房泛滥，新规定表明，老年患者会错过存活率更高的年轻人。

自桑切斯先生实施紧急状态以来，本周末将是两周，这是冠状病毒潜伏期的关键里程碑。
伯纳乌博士说：“我们完全不知所措。”

People are dying in waiting rooms before they can even be admitted as the coronavirus pandemic overpowers medical staff.
Intensive-care wards overflowing and new rules dictate that older patients miss out to younger people with a better shot at surviving, Dr Bernabeu said by telephone.
"Colleagues are falling sick around us," Dr Bernabeu said.
This weekend will mark two weeks since Mr Sanchez imposed the state of emergency, a key milestone for the incubation period for the coronavirus.
"We are completely overwhelmed," Dr Bernabeu said.

北京-中国已禁止拥有有效签证和居留许可的外国人进入中国，这是一项猛烈的举动，这几乎等于完全关闭了边境，因为它也严格限制了国际航班。
提供国际运输服务的外国人可获得C签证。
国内航空公司也将仅限于每周飞往一个国家最多一次。
外交部副部长罗朝晖周四表示，其中多达90％是中国公民。
罗先生说：“我们知道一些国外学生急于回家。”

BEIJING - China has banned foreigners with valid visas and residence permits from entering the country in a drastic move that amounts almost to a total shutdown of its borders as it also severely restricts international flights.
C visas are given to foreigners who provide international transportation services.
Domestic airlines, too, will be restricted to flying to only one country no more than once a week.
As many as 90 per cent of these are Chinese nationals, said Vice-Foreign Minister Luo Zhaohui on Thursday.
“We understand some students abroad are anxious to come home,” Mr Luo said.
