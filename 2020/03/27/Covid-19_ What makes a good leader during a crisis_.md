As a past example, Boin and his co-authors point to the UK’s ‘Mad Cow’ crisis more than two decades ago, after it became clear that eating beef with BSE could lead to Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, a form of neurodegeneration. One of the agriculture ministers tried to increase morale by eating a burger in front of TV cameras; his successor declared that the “British beef has never been safer” – even though potentially contaminated meat was still in circulation. Neither message washed with the public and together they only added to its distrust of the government’s response.

Overall, Boin and his colleagues argue that the initial message should be delivered quickly, to avoid other contrasting narratives “filling the vacuum”, and with five aims. “It offers a credible explanation of what happened, it offers guidance, it instils hope, shows empathy and suggests that leaders are in control.” If you fail on any one of those, you will begin to lose the public’s confidence.

Sense of purpose

In recent history, the New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s swift and heartfelt reaction to the Christchurch shootings may illustrate a leader who met these five goals. Her message showed compassion for the victims, clarified the hate-filled ideology that had caused the shootings while reaffirming New Zealand’s values as an open and tolerant country, and underlined the additional security measures to prevent further tragedy without underplaying the future risk. She went on to change the country’s gun laws and received widespread acclaim across the globe for her efforts.

Regarding the coronavirus, South Korea’s rapid response may be an exemplary demonstration of the principles of effective crisis management. The country had apparently started to stockpile coronavirus testing kits long before an outbreak had occurred on its own shores, allowing testing of 10,000 people a day when the infection rate started to climb, and a mobile app kept citizens constantly updated with the evolving situation. In Boin’s terms, the nation had already established the infrastructure for “sense making” of the situation. (This was partly the result of the previous MERS outbreak, which had already established some of the infrastructure necessary for a quick response to future outbreaks.)

Some of South Korea’s success must also be down to President Moon Jae-in’s messaging, which was clear and consistent along the lines that Boin’s work suggests. The public were primed, from the very beginning, to see the outbreak as a national emergency, with regular television broadcasts and subway announcements reminding citizens of the danger. According to an article by the New York Times’ bureau chief in Seoul, this built on an already high level of public trust to create a “wartime sense of purpose”.
