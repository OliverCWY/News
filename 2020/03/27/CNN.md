3月18日，西奥多·罗斯福号航空母舰。
美国海军现在有25名水手在西奥多·罗斯福号航空母舰上测试了冠状病毒的阳性结果，就在五角大楼宣布三名船员对病毒进行了阳性测试的两天后，一位海军官员向CNN证实。
海军表示，他们期望船员中还会有更多的正面测试，一位官员告诉CNN可能会出现“数十种”新案件。
海军作战司令官迈克·吉尔迪（Mike Gilday）表示，尽管爆发了疫情，但“我们相信，我们的积极反应将使西奥多·罗斯福号航空母舰能够应对该地区的任何危机。”
当天早些时候，代理海军部长托马斯·莫迪（Thomas Modly）曾表示，船上还有“更多”案件，但没有给出具体数字。

U.S. NavyThere are now 25 sailors who have tested positive for the coronavirus aboard the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, just two days after the Pentagon announced that three sailors aboard the ship had tested positive for the virus, a Navy official has confirmed to CNN.
The Navy says they expect there to be additional positive tests among the crew, with one official telling CNN there could possibly be "dozens" of new cases that emerge.
Despite the outbreak, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday said in a statement, "we are confident that our aggressive response will keep USS Theodore Roosevelt able to respond to any crisis in the region."
Earlier in the day, acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly had said there were "several" more cases onboard the ship, but did not give a specific number.

With the Covid-19 pandemic striking full force across the globe, it's easy to stare in disbelief at the growing number of deaths.
Not just because many will die, but because the Covid-19 pandemic is offering us a chance to reinvent ourselves.
The perversity of a virulent pandemic is that the affected hosts propagate the disease, accelerating the demise of members of their own species.
Covid-19 will change us as a species.
We must respond not just as nations fighting an enemy, but as a species fighting for survival.

Idlib, Syria (CNN) Everything Fatima Um Ali needs to protect herself and her family from the novel coronavirus is out of reach.
There is no running water, soap is expensive and hand sanitizer is an unaffordable luxury.
COVID-19 is heading toward the war-ravaged province like a "slow moving tsunami," the World Health Organization says, and could claim tens of thousands of lives.
The humanitarian crisis could culminate in an unparalleled health crisis when COVID-19 reaches Syria's northwest, says Dr. Munther Khalil from the opposition-controlled Idlib Health Directorate (IHD).
The World Health Organization has said that it will also deliver some testing kits to opposition-held Syria.

我们都应该向上帝祈祷，以使我们度过难关，我们将度过这场世界危机。”

As the clock neared six in the afternoon, Mintz and Abu Jama realized it may be their only break of the shift.
Abu Jama, an observant Muslim, knelt facing Mecca, his maroon and white prayer rug unfurled underneath him.
Abu Jama, a father of seven from the nearby Bedouin city of Rahat, was one of those volunteers.
If Mintz and Abu Jama see themselves as heroes, they certainly didn't let it show.
We should all pray to God to get us through this, and we will get through this world crisis."

As health care systems around the world are strained to the point of collapse, Cuban health care "brigades" have been invited to assist medical workers in Italy, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Suriname, Jamaica and Grenada.
On Tuesday, Cuban officials released video of a field hospital its health care workers had built in Lombardy, Italy, one of the regions hit hardest by the coronavirus.
But the State Department wants countries to reconsider asking Cuba for help in fighting the coronavirus pandemic.

以前，这种适应性水平仅与同时居住在南部非洲的现代人类有关。
研究人员在研究中写道：“菲格里拉·布拉瓦（Figueira Brava）提供了欧洲尼安德特人中大量海洋资源消耗的第一记录。
对于研究人员而言，这是缩小现代人类与尼安德特人之间差距的另一种方式。
一些研究人员认为，由于Omega-3脂肪酸和其他促进大脑的营养素，将海鲜引入早期现代人的饮食中有助于他们的认知发展。
这是在现代人类到达西欧地区之前。

Previously, this level of adaptability was only associated with modern humans living in southern Africa at the same time.
"Figueira Brava provides the first record of significant marine resource consumption among Europe's Neanderthals," the researchers wrote in the study.
For researchers, it's another way of narrowing the gap between modern humans and Neanderthals.
Some researchers believe that the introduction of seafood into the diet of early modern humans helped their cognitive development because of Omega-3 fatty acids and other brain-boosting nutrients.
This is before the arrival of modern humans in the Western Europe region.

## 从彩虹到灰色：染发剂的演变

### From rainbow to gray: The evolution of hair dye

该广告于1843年发布，用于切尔克斯的染发剂，有望将浅色的头发变成“美丽的”棕色或黑色。
直到20世纪初，才出现了我们所知道的染发剂-化学的，彩虹般的颜色，在商店购买或在沙龙上使用的-。
两年后，舒勒（Schueller）创立了自己的公司，法国无害染发剂公司（Hamless Hair Dye Company），这个名称旨在减轻人们对使用人造染发剂的恐惧。
1943年，克莱尔（Clairol）的一项印刷活动“灰发-无情的独裁者”宣称：“没有正义或仁慈，白发就能统治您的生活...
尽管灰色可能会在Instagram上流行，但自然的白发在世界范围内的女性和中国的男性中仍然享有盛誉。

This advertisement for Circassian hair dye published in 1843 promises to change light hair into "beautiful" brown or black.
It wasn't until the early 20th century that hair dye as we know it -- chemical, in a rainbow of colors, shop-bought or salon-applied -- came to be.
Two years later, Schueller founded his business, the French Harmless Hair Dye Company -- a name meant to alleviate people's fears of using manufactured hair color.
A Clairol print campaign from 1943, "Gray Hair -- The Heartless Dictator," declared: "Without justice or kindness, gray hair can rule your life...
While gray coloring might trend on Instagram, natural gray hair still has a complicated reputation for women around the world -- and in China, men.

但是，如果人们对草坪护理的态度发生了变化，这些草绿色的地块将带来巨大的机会。
面对野生动植物园还是草皮草坪之间的选择-后者在干旱地区也越来越受欢迎-NWW的高级主管玛丽·菲利普斯（Mary Phillips）敦促人们考虑自然。
她提到最近的一项研究，该研究表明野生动植物园可以支持与自然公园媲美的蜜蜂生物多样性，因此，鸟类尤其是鸣禽的数量和种类也更多。

“人们通常试图从草坪上走出来的东西，我们说的是'不，那好在你的草坪上！'”

If attitudes toward lawn care are shifted, however, these grassy green patches represent a gigantic opportunity.
Faced with the choice between a wildlife garden or astroturf -- the latter has also become increasingly popular in drought-hit areas -- Mary Phillips, senior director of NWW, urges people to consider nature.
She refers to recent research that shows wildlife gardens can support bee biodiversity comparable to natural parklands and, as a result, a greater number and diversity of birds, especially songbirds.

## 泰国大象公园承诺将因病毒而报废游客

### Thailand elephant park promises to scrap tourist rides because of virus

她告诉美国有线电视新闻网，泰国北部清迈Maesa大象营的拥有者Anchalee Kalampichit周一关闭了公园，因为游客人数从每天的“数百人”锐减到不足20人。
她说，他的已故父亲于1970年代创立了Maesa Elephant Camp的Kalampichit，在去年“多次”访问泰国北部的大象自然公园后做出了这一决定。
“除了表演和骑象，我不知道在营地还能做什么。
我在大象自然公园与一位以拯救大象和自然而闻名的女士交谈过……她让大象自由地走动。
她说：“我们希望在Maesa大象营做同样的事情，而不是骑马。”

Anchalee Kalampichit, the owner of Maesa Elephant Camp in Chiang Mai, northern Thailand, closed the park on Monday after tourist numbers plummeted from "hundreds" each day to less than 20, she told CNN.
Kalampichit, whose late father founded Maesa Elephant Camp in the 1970s, made the decision after visiting the Elephant Nature Park in northern Thailand "many times" last year, she said.
"I didn't know what else to do in the camp instead of shows and elephant riding.
I talked to one lady who is well known for saving elephants and nature at the Elephant Nature Park... she lets the elephants go around unchained.
"We want to do the same thing at Maesa Elephant Camp instead of riding," she said.

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
后来空袭被估计是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

## 木摩天大楼革命终于到来了吗？

### Has the wooden skyscraper revolution finally arrived?

Mjøstårnet的高度达到280英尺，于去年开放后成为世界上最高的木材建筑。
长期倡导和设计木制建筑的建筑师Michael Green表示，“现在有很多东西在融合。”
Or Framework是位于俄勒冈州波特兰的一座雄心勃勃的148英尺高的木塔，在去年因成本担忧而被取消之前，该塔被设定为美国最高的木塔。
考虑到在2018年之前，俄勒冈州成为美国第一个允许使用18层木制建筑的州，而在美国，没有任何地方允许任何超过6层的建筑物，这一决定意义重大。
该组织表示，除了担心森林砍伐外，洒水喷头不能有效防止烈焰扩散到木结构建筑中。

Reaching 280 feet in height, Mjøstårnet became the world's tallest timber building upon opening last year.
According to architect Michael Green, a longstanding advocate for -- and designer of -- wooden buildings, there are "a whole bunch of things converging right now."
Or Framework, an ambitious 148-foot-tall timber tower in Portland, Oregon, that was set to be the USA's tallest wooden tower before was canceled amid cost concerns last year.
The decision is significant given that, before 2018, when Oregon became the first US state to allow 18-story wooden buildings, nowhere in America permitted anything higher than six.
In addition to concerns about deforestation, the group says sprinklers are ineffective at preventing blazes from spreading through wood buildings.
