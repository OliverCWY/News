New York (CNN) Finding time to celebrate love during a national crisis isn't easy. But one New York couple still found a way.

Reilly Jennings and Amanda Wheeler tied the knot on Friday at a ceremony held on a small street in the Manhattan neighborhood of Washington Heights. Matt Wilson, a friend and a licensed marriage officiant, leaned out of his fourth-floor window to lead the ceremony safely away from anyone who might be carrying coronavirus.

"It was the most New York moment ever and was even more special to share with the entire neighborhood in such a scary and uncertain time," Jennings told CNN. "I love this city."

The couple was supposed to get married in October but decided to have a quick courthouse wedding instead. The decision stemmed from their concerns that the coronavirus pandemic could worsen.

The city has ground to a halt. With more than 10,000 reported cases and dozens of deaths, businesses have closed, and residents are being asked to keep their distance and stay indoors when possible.
