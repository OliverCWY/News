比尔·德·布拉西奥在周日说：“距离普遍短缺大约有10天的路程。”
纽约州已成为美国爆发疫情的中心，占该州病例的近一半。
特朗普在周日在白宫举行的新闻发布会上说，他还批准了华盛顿州的一项重大灾难声明，并将批准加利福尼亚的类似措施。
特朗普总统还表示，许多医疗物资将被送往全国各地，以及受灾最严重的纽约，华盛顿和加利福尼亚的紧急医疗站。
同时，华盛顿州的一家医院-曾经是美国爆发的中心-表示它可能在4月之前耗尽呼吸机。

"We're about 10 days away from seeing widespread shortages," Bill de Blasio said on Sunday.
New York state has become the epicentre of the outbreak in the US and accounts for almost half of the country's cases.
Speaking at a news conference at the White House on Sunday, Mr Trump said he had also approved a major disaster declaration for Washington state and would approve a similar measure for California.
President Trump also said a number of medical supplies were being sent to locations nationwide, as well as emergency medical stations for New York, Washington and California, the worst-hit states.
Meanwhile, a hospital in Washington state - once the centre of the US outbreak - said it could run out of ventilators by April.

2020年东京奥运会将于7月24日开始。国际奥委会正在考虑推迟2020年东京奥运会，并为其作出了4周的最后期限做出决定。
它在一份声明中说：“鉴于全球形势的恶化……执行委员会今天已经开始了国际奥委会的情景计划的下一步。”
这一发展标志着国际奥委会的重大转变，国际奥委会在五天前表示已“完全致力于” 2020年东京奥运会。
英国奥林匹克协会（BOA）主席休·罗伯逊爵士说：“我们欢迎国际奥委会执行委员会决定对推迟2020年东京奥运会的方案进行审查。
“国际奥委会执行委员会强调，取消2020年东京奥运会不会解决任何问题或对任何人有所帮助。”

The Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games are due to start on 24 JulyThe International Olympic Committee is considering a postponement of Tokyo 2020, and has given itself a deadline of four weeks to make a decision.
"In light of the worldwide deteriorating situation... the executive board has today initiated the next step in the IOC's scenario-planning," it said in a statement.
The development marks a significant shift by the IOC, which as recently as five days ago said it was "fully committed" to the Tokyo 2020 Games.
British Olympic Association (BOA) chairman Sir Hugh Robertson said: "We welcome the IOC executive board decision to review the options in respect of a postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.
"The IOC executive board emphasised that a cancellation of the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 would not solve any of the problems or help anybody."

在英国，这一比例甚至更低，只有34％的同一年龄段的人拥有财产（1996年为55％）。
可移动的别具一格的租赁植物“现房是一所房子，无论是否租用，”现居纽约的27岁房客切尔西·布朗（Chelsey Brown）说。
例如，我一直想在家中使用墙板，所以我想出了一种安装临时护墙板的方法。
此外，我一直梦想拥有一个白色大理石厨房，并通过使用可移动的剥离粘贴产品在自己的房屋中实现这种外观。”对于一些年轻的房客，个性化房屋可以归结为负担得起，时尚的住宅。补充。
布朗目前正致力于为承租人开发一系列可移动产品，例如粘地板砖和可移动后挡板，其灵感来自于她对出租物业进行大修的经验。

In the UK this is even lower, with just 34% of people in the same age group owning property (compared to 55% in 1996).
Removable chic, rental plants“A house is a home whether it’s rented or not,” says renter Chelsey Brown, 27, who resides in New York.
For example, I’ve always wanted wall panelling in my home and so I figured out a way to install temporary wainscoting.
Additionally, I’ve always dreamed of having a white, marble kitchen and I achieved that look in my own rental by using removable, peel-and-stick products.”For some young renters, personalising a home can come down to affordable, stylish additions.
Brown is currently working on a range of removable products for renters, such as stick-on floor tiles and removable back splashes inspired by her own experience of overhauling a rental property.

随着Covid-19的蔓延，我们对表面的恐惧也随之蔓延。
与许多呼吸道病毒（包括流感）一样，Covid-19可以在感染者咳嗽时从被感染者的鼻子和嘴中释放出来的微小飞沫传播。
因此，尽管我们仍然不知道确切的原因是由受污染的表面直接造成多少例，但专家建议谨慎行事。

研究人员现在开始更多地了解这如何影响新的冠状病毒的传播。

As Covid-19 has spread, so has our fear of surfaces.
Like many respiratory viruses, including flu, Covid-19 can be spread in tiny droplets released from the nose and mouth of an infected person as they cough.
So although we still don't know exactly how many cases are being caused directly by contaminated surfaces, experts advise exercising caution.

法国政治消息人士还告诉英国广播公司，马克龙总统准备在周五关闭与英国的边界。
上周初，法国总理爱德华·菲利普（ÉdouardPhilippe）也特别提到了英国，以表彰他所谓的“避免围堵措施”以解决冠状病毒大流行。
马克龙总统和总理鲍里斯·约翰逊之间的通话之后，周五下午关闭边界的计划被取消。
约翰逊先生与爱尔兰总理里奥·瓦拉德卡（Leo Varadkar）于周四进行了讨论，他们承诺将使方法尽可能保持一致。
但在上周一向政府介绍了压倒性意大利卫生系统的流行病的证据后，英国的做法确实发生了变化。

French political sources also told the BBC that President Macron was ready to close the border with the UK on Friday.
Early last week, the French Prime Minister Édouard Philippe, also singled out the UK for what he referred to as "avoiding containment measures" around the coronavirus pandemic.
The plan to close the border on Friday afternoon was called off after the call between President Macron and Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
A discussion between Mr Johnson and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar took place on Thursday, where they promised to keep approaches aligned as much as possible.
But the UK approach did change after evidence of the epidemic overwhelming the Italian health system was presented to the government last Monday.

中国根据购买力平价（PPP）的GDP（根据不同国家的价格水平差异进行了调整）来衡量，中国已经是世界上最大的经济体。
预计到2050年，印度将成为世界第二大经济体（超过美国），并将占世界GDP的15％。
“印度不会适应您的需求。”巴西这座南美大国到2050年将成为世界第五大经济体，在此过程中将超过日本，德国和俄罗斯。

ChinaAs measured by GDP by purchasing power parity (PPP), which adjusts for price level differences across countries, China already has the largest economy in the world.

例如，Sungard的Southwark桥路站点通常在大多数日子里都是空的，通常会将其三个入口中的两个锁定。
这样的备份办公室在行业中被称为“热点”，因为它们可以立即使用，而无需先装箱或“热身”。
提供食物通常是一个挑战，因为没人能预测何时使用备用办公室或使用程度。
例如，由于Sungard的建筑物没有食堂，因此公司可能会预购整顿自助午餐。
国际灾难恢复研究所总裁兼首席执行官克洛伊·德姆罗夫斯基（Chloe Demrovsky）指出，大流行是一种非常特殊的危机。

For example, Sungard’s Southwark Bridge Road site, which is practically empty on most days, usually keeps two of its three entrances locked.
Such backup offices are termed “hot sites” in the industry because they can be used immediately and don’t need to be kitted out or “warmed up” first.
Providing food is often a challenge because no one can predict when backup offices will be in use or to what extent.
Firms might, for example, pre-order entire buffets for lunch as Sungard’s buildings don’t have canteens.
Pandemics are a very specific kind of crisis, notes Chloe Demrovsky, president and chief executive of Disaster Recovery Institute International.

道格拉斯·费尔班克斯（Douglas Fairbanks）不仅是超人的灵感来源。
蝙蝠侠艺术家鲍勃·凯恩（Bob Kane）借鉴了更加险恶的电影传统，例如令人毛骨悚然的蝙蝠低语者。蝙蝠侠。
克莫德说：“ 1920年的《佐罗印记》（由费尔班克斯主演）的特色是英雄的经典寓言，这不仅影响了超人，还影响了蝙蝠侠，后者的漫画于1939年在报亭上映。
而他的艺术家鲍勃·凯恩（Bob Kane）则借鉴了更加险恶的电影传统，例如令人毛骨悚然的1930年之谜，《蝙蝠低语》及其无声的前身《蝙蝠》，甚至还带有著名的蝙蝠信号版本。
“秘密身份的惯例可以追溯到佐罗（Zorro）和猩红皮珀尔（Scarlet Pimpernel）这样的人物，他们伪装成笨蛋，所以没人怀疑他们在报仇。”

And Douglas Fairbanks wasn't just an inspiration for Superman.
Batman artist Bob Kane drew on a more sinister cinematic tradition, such as the creepy The Bat WhispersWhen DC Comics' bosses were looking for another character to add to their roster alongside the Man of Steel, writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane came up with the Batman.
Kermode says: "1920’s The Mark of Zorro [starring Fairbanks] features the classic trope of a hero with a secret identity, which influenced not just Superman but Batman, whose comics hit newsstands in 1939.
And his artist, Bob Kane, drew on a more sinister cinematic tradition, such as the creepy 1930 mystery, The Bat Whispers and its silent precursor, The Bat, which even features a version of the famous Bat-signal.
"The convention of the secret identity goes back to characters like Zorro and the Scarlet Pimpernel, who posed as foppish idiots so no one suspected they were avenging outlaws."

杰克建议您给自己充裕的时间学习烹饪。
在为孩子的父亲烹制了灾难性的炖羊肉后，她开始真正地重视烹饪。
“如果我把东西塞好，我会尝试修复它，然后我会自学做饭。
我花了一个月左右的时间才真正迈出大步，然后才有东西点击。
我已尽力确保食谱既简单又美味，并且可以使用-我想将这种风险因素排除在人们之外。”

Jack advises that you allow yourself plenty of time to learn to cook.
After cooking a disastrous lamb stew for the father of her child, she started to really pay attention to cooking.
“If I cocked something up I would try to fix it and I would teach myself to cook.
It took a month or so before I really hit my stride and then something clicked.
I’ve tried my best to make sure recipes are simple and delicious and that they work – I want to take that risk factor out for people.”
