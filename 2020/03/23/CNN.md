在这些案件中，几乎有一半（15,168起）发生在纽约州政府所在地。
加文·纽瑟姆（Gavin Newsom）表示，测试应优先考虑住院患者，免疫系统受损的人，医护人员，老年人和其他高危患者。
罗恩·迪桑蒂斯（Ron DeSantis）说，医护人员和急救人员将接受优先检测。
医护人员将获得生产量的90％，其余的将用于对付冠状病毒大流行至关重要的其他行业。
他说，在纽约州已确认的15,000多个病例中，有53％是18至49岁的人。

Almost half of those cases -- 15,168 -- were in New York state, where Gov.
Gavin Newsom said testing should prioritize hospitalized patients, people with compromised immune systems, health care workers, seniors and other high-risk patients.
Ron DeSantis said health care workers and first responders would receive priority testing.
Health care workers will receive 90% of the production output, while the rest will go to other industries deemed critical to dealing with the coronavirus pandemic.
Of the more than 15,000 confirmed cases in New York state, 53% are people between ages 18 and 49, he said.

## 冠状病毒带来了危险的世界末日预言

### Coronavirus is bringing a plague of dangerous doomsday predictions

但是，冠状病毒大流行已经使布朗的著作“日子的终结：关于世界末日的预测和预言”引起了新的关注。
比尔说，圣经中的世界末日预言也可能导致另一种危险-无所作为。
莱纳说：“启示录不是关于预言的书，而是安慰的书。”
他说，安慰是人们现在应该在社交媒体上传播的东西，而不是世界末日的预测。
他说，但是在您决定与内心的诺查丹玛斯取得联系之前，先分享一个友善的词，而不是世界末日的预言。

But the coronavirus pandemic has brought new attention to Browne's book, "End of Days: Predictions and Prophecies About the End of the World."
Doomsday predictions from the Bible can also lead to another danger -- doing nothing, Beal says.
"The book of Revelation is not a book about predictions but a book of consolation," Lehner says.
Consolation is what people should spread on social media right now -- not doomsday predictions, he says.
But before you decide to get in touch with your inner Nostradamus, share a kind word rather than a doomsday prediction, he says.

对于像艾莉森（Allison's）这样的小型食品银行来说，这是一个真正的问题。
柠檬说：“有心理健康问题的人，单身母亲，残疾人……这些人在食品银行中的人数过多。”
在冠状病毒的情况下，对服务的需求增加以及与食物库一样，对志愿者网络的打击造成了噩梦。

For small food banks like Allison's, it's a real concern.
"People with mental health problems, single mothers, disabled people ... these people are all overrepresented in food banks," says Lemon.
In the context of coronavirus, the combination of an increased demand for services and, as with food banks, a hit on the volunteer network has created a nightmare scenario.

华盛顿（CNN）参议院民主党人周日晚上通过大规模刺激计划阻止了运动，这为立法者是否会以及何时达成两党协议以在灾难性冠状病毒大流行中提供救济提供了新的不确定性。
尚未达成针对冠状病毒传播造成损失的两党最终协议，但预计谈判将持续到周日晚上。
尽管会议尚未达成两党协议，麦康奈尔在会后的新闻发布会上发表了乐观的口吻。
当被问及他是否认为参议院民主党将投票反对在周日的经济刺激法案中采取封闭措施时，伊利诺伊州参议员说，由于谈判仍在进行中，他不会猜测。
如果佩洛西不支持该法案，参议院民主党人可以通过阻止定于周日下午进行表决的程序动议来中止对该法案采取行动。

Washington (CNN) Senate Democrats blocked movement on a massive stimulus package Sunday evening, injecting fresh uncertainty over whether and when lawmakers will reach a bipartisan deal to deliver relief amid the devastating coronavirus pandemic .
A final bipartisan deal to respond to the toll of the spread of coronavirus has not yet been reached, but talks are expected to continue into Sunday evening.
McConnell struck an optimistic tone in a news conference after the meeting, despite the fact that no bipartisan deal has been reached yet.
Asked if he thinks Senate Democrats would vote against cloture on the economic stimulus bill Sunday, the Illinois senator said he's not going to speculate as negotiations are still ongoing.
If Pelosi doesn't support the bill, Senate Democrats could stall action on the bill by blocking a procedural motion set for a vote Sunday afternoon.

But in 1980, after Japan's Supreme Court finalized Iwao's death penalty, he was transferred to a prison exclusively for death row inmates.
Despite the odds, she is committed to clearing her brother's name and to changing people's perceptions of the death penalty.
"But someone who committed a crime, or who finds themselves on death row, is still a human."

Mierzwinski说：“人们应该意识到，可以用很多不同的方式来偿还学生贷款。”
您需要与您的服务商（您要向其进行抵押贷款的公司）联系，并制定切实可行的计划。
他说：“您将其发送给不需要的人，并将其发送给可能决定去冲浪而不是工作的人。”

"I don't have the money in the bank to pay the bills that are coming up," she said.
"I have credit card debt because I'm a single mom and that's what I have to do to survive," she said.
"People should be aware there are a lot of different ways you can pay your student loan," said Mierzwinski.
You need to contact your servicer -- the company you make mortgage payments to -- and work out a realistic plan going forward.
"You're sending it to people who don't need it and you're sending it to people who may decide to go surfing instead of working," he said.

Apple发出的警告2月17日是美国的假期，股票市场已经关闭。
依靠全球供应链和及时交货来保持工厂开放的汽车制造商关闭了欧洲乃至美国的工厂。
凯投宏观（Capital Economics）首席经济学家尼尔·希拉林（Neil Shearing）表示，中央银行在股票市场下设限的能力是有限的。
在这种情况发生之前，我们应该期望股市继续承受压力。”
摩根士丹利说，来自美国，欧洲，日本，英国和中国的支出承诺总计至少为1.7万亿美元。

A warning from AppleFebruary 17 was a holiday in the United States and stock markets were closed.
Carmakers, which rely on global supply chains and timely deliveries to keep their plants open, shuttered factories in Europe and then the United States.
According to Neil Shearing, the chief economist at Capital Economics, the ability of central banks to put a floor under stock markets is limited.
Until this happens, we should expect stock markets to remain under pressure," he said.
Morgan Stanley says spending commitments from the United States, Europe, Japan, the United Kingdom and China add up to at least $1.7 trillion.

In other areas, uncrowded parks and neighborhoods are still considered a fine option for fresh air.
Like social distancing, it may be positioned to be the next phenomenon introduced in the wave of new social behavior norms.
You should drive to the hiking location in separate cars, he says, if the other person isn't someone you live with to maintain social distancing.
Visiting an uncrowded beach in the off-season is a low-risk activity.
It's OK to stretch your legs or curl up on a blanket on an uncrowded stretch of beach.

## 观点：王室离婚很重要

但是在最近的历史中，随着离婚在英国乃至全世界变得越来越普遍，王室已经表明，至少通过这种方式，他们的确与我们其他人一样。
在1990年代三次温莎离婚撼动了王室之后，这种接受程度的转变才发生在过去的三十年中，而且再也不是一样了。
当时，离婚在社会上是不可接受的，而皇家法院是所有法庭中最严格的。
一个人没有，他扬言要与他的妻子哈丽特·莫尔达特（Harriet Mordaunt）离婚-威尔士亲王在离婚案中作证的前景太可怕了。
王室可能已经被迫接受离婚和结婚离婚的念头，但是他们做到这一点至关重要。

But in more recent history, as divorce has become more common in Britain and across the world, the royal family has shown that in this way, at least, they really are just like the rest of us.
This shift in acceptance has happened only in the past three decades, after three Windsor divorces rocked the royal family in the 1990s -- and it was never the same again.
At the time, divorcees were not acceptable in society, and the royal Court was the strictest of all.
One did not, and he threatened to divorce his wife, Harriet Mordaunt -- and the prospect of the Prince of Wales as a witness in a divorce case was too dreadful.
The royal family may have been dragged into accepting divorce and the idea of marrying divorcees, but it is vital that they did.
