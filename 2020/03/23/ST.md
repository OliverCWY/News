世界卫生组织的首席紧急专家周日（3月22日）说，各国不能简单地锁定社会以打败冠状病毒，并补充说需要采取公共卫生措施，以免日后病毒再次流行。
如果我们现在不采取有力的公共卫生措施，那么当这些行动限制和封锁解除后，危险就可能是疾病会再次发作。”
瑞安博士还说，几种疫苗正在开发中，但是只有一种在美国开始试验。
他说：“我们必须确保它绝对安全……我们正在谈论至少一年。”
“疫苗将会来，但是我们需要出去做现在需要做的事情。”

LONDON (REUTERS) - Countries can't simply lock down their societies to defeat coronavirus, the World Health Organisation's top emergency expert said on Sunday (March 22), adding that public health measures are needed to avoid a resurgence of the virus later on.
If we don't put in place the strong public health measures now, when those movement restrictions and lockdowns are lifted, the danger is the disease will jump back up."
Dr Ryan also said that several vaccines were in development, but only one had begun trials in the US.
"We have to make sure that it's absolutely safe... we are talking at least a year," he said.
"The vaccines will come, but we need to get out and do what we need to do now."

雅典（路透社）-国际奥委会将在周日的紧急会议（3月22日）后说，将加强对2020年东京奥运会的“情景规划”，包括可能的推迟。
国际奥委会在一份声明中说：“因此，取消谈判不在议程上。”他补充说，讨论将在未来四个星期内完成。
“国际奥委会将……开始详细讨论，以完成对世界卫生状况的迅速发展及其对奥运会的影响的评估，包括推迟的情况。
BOA主席休·罗伯森说：“我们欢迎国际奥委会执行局决定推迟东京2020年奥运会的方案。”
他已经获得了奥运会的参赛资格，他周六表示，他正在为其他运动员的安全抵制奥运会。

ATHENS (REUTERS) - The International Olympic Committee is to step-up its "scenario planning" for the Tokyo 2020 Games - including a possible postponement - it said after an emergency meeting on Sunday (March 22).
"Therefore, cancellation is not on the agenda," the IOC said in a statement, adding that the discussions would be completed within the next four weeks.
"The IOC will... start detailed discussions to complete its assessment of the rapid development of the worldwide health situation and its impact on the Olympic Games, including the scenario of postponement.
"We welcome the IOC Executive Board decision to review the options in respect of a postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games," BOA chairman Hugh Robertson said.
Already qualified for the Olympics, he said on Saturday he was boycotting the Games for the safety of other athletes.

迪拜（路透社）-世界最大的长途航空公司之一阿联酋航空周日（3月22日）表示，由于冠状病毒对旅行需求的影响，本周它将停止几乎所有的客运航班，并将员工工资削减多达一半。 。
这家总部位于迪拜的航空公司最初表示将在周三之前停止所有乘客的运营，并将应政府的要求维持飞往13个国家的某些服务，以进行遣返航班。
国际连接对于阿联酋的海湾枢纽模式至关重要，该模式在六年前将迪拜变成了世界上最繁忙的国际机场。
今天，我们决定在2020年3月25日之前暂停大部分乘客的航班。
这一痛苦但务实的举动将帮助阿联酋航空集团保持业务活力并确保全球范围内的工作，避免裁员。

DUBAI (REUTERS) - Emirates, one of the world’s biggest long-haul airlines, said on Sunday (March 22) it would stop nearly all passenger flights this week and cut staff wages by as much as half because of the coronavirus impact on travel demand.
The Dubai based airline, which initially said it was stopping all passenger operations by Wednesday, will maintain some services to 13 countries for repatriation flights at the request of governments.
International connectivity is crucial for Emirates’ Gulf hub model, which transformed Dubai six years ago into the world’s busiest international airport.
Today we made the decision to temporarily suspend most passenger flights by 25 March 2020.
This painful but pragmatic move will help Emirates Group preserve business viability and secure jobs worldwide, avoiding cuts.

新加坡-八名新加坡人登上由马来西亚政府安排的伊朗首都伊朗首都德黑兰的遣返航班后，已抵达吉隆坡。
外交部（MFA）在周日（3月22日）的一份声明中说，新加坡人将按照马来西亚卫生当局的要求在吉隆坡进行为期14天的检疫，然后再返回家园。
我们期待着新加坡人在马来西亚完成检疫后欢迎他们回国。
马来西亚国家灾难管理机构说，亚航的航班是专门为执行任务而包机的，它于周日上午6.35降落。
据报道，总共有46名个人（包括儿童）已在马来西亚驻德黑兰大使馆登记，这是在星期六晚上从德黑兰出发的特别航班上。

SINGAPORE - Eight Singaporeans have arrived in Kuala Lumpur after boarding a repatriation flight from Iran's capital, Teheran, arranged by the Malaysian government for its nationals.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said in a statement on Sunday (March 22) that the Singaporeans will serve a 14-day quarantine in Kuala Lumpur, as required by the Malaysian health authorities before returning home.
We look forward to welcoming the Singaporeans back home once they have completed their quarantine in Malaysia.
An AirAsia flight was chartered specifically for the mission and it landed at 6.35am on Sunday, said Malaysia's National Disaster Management Agency.
A total of 46 individuals, including children, who had registered with the Malaysian Embassy in Teheran were reported to have been on the special flight which departed from Teheran on Saturday night.

悉尼（布隆堡）-澳大利亚全国的冠状病毒病例激增至1000例以上之后，当局正准备关闭非必要服务并关闭州边界，澳大利亚正逐步走向封锁。
人们无视物理隔离建议而感到愤慨，尤其是在悉尼的邦迪海滩。在成千上万的人涌向这座标志性地标后，警察将其关闭。
莫里森周日说：“昨天在邦迪海滩发生的事情还不顺利。”
从塔斯马尼亚岛和北领地已经采取的措施，从星期二进入南澳大利亚和西澳大利亚的任何人都必须隔离自己14天。
莫里森周日表示，澳大利亚政府将向经济注入660亿澳元（合540亿新元），以保护该国免受冠状病毒的财务影响。

SYDNEY (BLOOMBERG) - Australia is edging toward lockdown with authorities preparing to shutter non-essential services and close state borders after the number of coronavirus cases in the nation surged past 1,000.
Authorities have grown exasperated with people ignoring physical-separation advice – not least at Sydney’s Bondi Beach, which was closed by police after thousands flocked to the iconic landmark.
“What happened at Bondi Beach yesterday was not alright,” Morrison said Sunday.
Anyone entering South Australia and Western Australia from Tuesday must isolate themselves for 14 days, measures already taken in Tasmania and the Northern Territory.
Australia’s government will inject A$66 billion (S$54 billion) into the economy to shelter the country from the financial impact of the coronavirus, Morrison said on Sunday.

昨天，来自Rela的军队和志愿军成员在马来西亚街头与警察一起执行了为期两周的政府命令，要求人们留在家中，因为该国又发生了两次死亡事件，总数达到10人。
在一些人继续违反上星期三开始实施的限制措施之后，马来西亚政府召集了军队。
穿制服的人员将在全国的城市和农村地区动员，包括边界，医院，超级市场和湿市场，以确保人们服从命令。
面对公众愤怒的成千上万的Tabligh成员没有出来接受测试，一群团体中的长者Abdullah Cheong先生表示，他们正在与当局合作。
他声称只有12,500人参加了Tabligh聚会，其中包括外国人，而不是政府先前宣布的16,000人。

Members of the army and volunteer corpsmen from Rela yesterday joined police on the streets of Malaysia to enforce a two-week government order for people to stay home, as the country recorded two more fatalities, bringing the tally to 10.
The Malaysian government called in the military after some people continued to disobey restrictions that had kicked in last Wednesday.
The uniformed personnel will be mobilised in cities and rural areas nationwide including at borders, hospitals, supermarkets and wet markets to ensure people obey the order.
Faced with public anger that several thousand Tabligh members have not come forward to be tested, a group elder, Mr Abdullah Cheong, said they are cooperating with the authorities.
He claimed that only 12,500 people attended the Tabligh gathering, including foreigners, and not 16,000 as previously announced by the government.

八打灵再也（星/亚洲新闻网）-据美国新闻网站报道，据报道，逃亡马来西亚商人Low Taek Jho（更名为Jho Low）拥有的洛杉矶物业已以1850万美元（2680万新元）的价格出售。 。
根据《综艺》报道，Low于2012年11月以3900万美元的价格购买了Sunset Strip的房产。
根据这份报告，该物业最初是由演员里卡多·蒙塔尔班（Ricardo Montalban）于1980年代建造的。
他于2009年去世后，又卖给了爱尔兰投资者Paddy McKillen和开发商Nile Niami。
他说：“这座堡垒般的建筑可以看到整个洛杉矶天际线的喷气式飞机景象，随后以市场价格出售给了洛。

PETALING JAYA (THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - A Los Angeles property reportedly owned by fugitive Malaysian businessman Low Taek Jho, better known as Jho Low, has been sold for US$18.5 million (S$26.8 million), a US news site has reported.
According to the Variety, Low bought the Sunset Strip property for US$39 million in November 2012.
The property, according to the report, was originally built in the 1980s by actor Ricardo Montalban.
After his death in 2009, it was then sold to Irish investor Paddy McKillen and developer Nile Niami.
"The fortress-like compound, which has jetliner views of the entire LA skyline, was subsequently sold to Low in an off-market deal.

到2024年，印度的航空业已有望成为第三大航空客运市场，近年来需求增长了两位数，但高速飞行的时代很快就结束了。
去年，国内客运增速下降至仅3.74％，而2018年为18.6％，这一数字使该行业已习惯于令人眼花growth乱的增长。

India's aviation industry had been tipped to become the third largest air passenger market by 2024 with demand growing by double digits in recent years but the high-flying times are fast coming to an end.
Domestic passenger growth fell to just 3.74 per cent last year, compared with 18.6 per cent in 2018, figures that have cast a gloomy outlook on a sector that had become habituated to dizzying growth.

## 联合国说，水是应对气候变化的未充分利用的武器

### Water is an under-used weapon in climate change fight, UN says

他说，使用更少的能源可以进一步减少发电所需的水，从而形成良性循环。
政策“脱节”这些方法的主要障碍之一是从事气候变化工作的政府官员与负责水资源管理的官员之间缺乏合作。
联合国报告指出，例如，2015年《关于气候变化的巴黎协定》没有提到水。
报告说，为适应日益严重的水资源压力并减少用水量而做出的更加具体的努力，将需要气候变化与水利专家之间共同制定计划，并投入更多的资金投入实施。
它指出，2016年在用于气候变化措施的4,550亿美元（6,596亿新元）中，只有2.6％分配给了水资源管理。

Using less energy cuts down further on the water needed to produce electricity, creating a virtuous circle, he said.
POLICY 'DISCONNECT'One of the main barriers to these types of approaches is a lack of cooperation between government officials working on climate change and those tasked with managing water.
For example, the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change does not mention water, the UN report noted.
More concrete efforts to adapt to rising water stress and cut emissions from water use will require joint planning between climate change and water specialists, as well as greater investment to put them into practice, the report said.
In 2016, only 2.6 per cent of US$455 billion (S$659.6 billion) invested in climate change measures was allocated to water management, it noted.

在这些案件中，有18宗是进口案件，这些案件曾前往欧洲，北美，南美和东盟。
几乎所有这些新引入的案件都是回国居民和长期通行证持有人，仅有一名短期访客。
周日宣布的五起本地传播案件中，有三起与以前的案件有关。
新加坡的大多数新患者最近都是外来病例，现在已经超过了本地传播的病例。
迄今为止，在185个国家/地区中有超过260,000例Covid-19病例，约有11,200例死亡。

Of these cases, 18 were imported cases that had travelled to Europe, North America, South America and Asean.
Almost all of these new imported cases are returning residents and long-term pass holders, with only one short-term visitor.
Of the five locally transmitted cases announced Sunday, three are linked to previous cases.
Most of the new patients in Singapore recently have been imported cases, which now outnumber those transmitted locally.
To date, there are more than 260,000 Covid-19 cases across 185 countries, and around 11,200 deaths.
