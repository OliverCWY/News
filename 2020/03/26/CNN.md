新西兰惠灵顿（CNN）据新西兰警方称，该名男子去年被控在两个基督城清真寺谋杀51名信徒，已将其认罪。
去年，澳大利亚公民布伦顿·塔兰特（Brenton Tarrant）对92项指控无罪，其中包括51项谋杀罪，40项未遂谋杀罪和一项根据《制止恐怖主义法》提出的指控，这是该指控首次在澳大利亚境内提出。
但是，塔兰特（Tarrant）通过奥克兰一所监狱的视听链接露面，他在周四早上在基督城高等法院的一次听证会上认罪。
高等法院的听证会是在新西兰进入封锁状态以阻止冠状病毒传播的同时进行的，只有包括法院在内的基本服务才允许开放。

Last year, Australian citizen Brenton Tarrant plead not guilty to 92 charges, including 51 counts of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder and one charge under the Terrorism Suppression Act, the first time such a charge has been laid inside the country.

莫斯科（CNN）俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京（Vladimir Putin）长期以来一直为其他世界领导人提供威权统治的模板。
现在，他面临一个新的考验：他的自上而下的系统能否在冠状病毒大流行中幸存下来。
普京星期三在全国电视讲话中宣布了一系列措施，以应对这种病毒的传播及其扩大的经济影响。
有权获得政府补助来抚养多个孩子的家庭将每月获得额外补助。
但是，冠状病毒对俄罗斯领导人具有政治意义：普京还宣布，原定于4月22日举行的全国性宪法修正案全民公决已推迟至另行通知。

Moscow (CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin has long provided other world leaders with a template for authoritarian rule.
Now he faces a new test: Whether his top-down system can survive the coronavirus pandemic.
In a televised address to the nation Wednesday, Putin announced a sweeping array of measures to cope with the spread of the virus and its widening economic effects.
And families entitled to government payments to support multiple children will receive extra monthly payments.
But coronavirus has taken on a political dimension for the Russian leader: Putin also announced that a nationwide referendum on constitutional amendments scheduled for April 22 has been postponed until further notice.

Some plan to turn hotels into shelters for coronavirus patients with mild symptoms, others as safe houses to isolate those who may have been in contact with confirmed cases.
Ayre Gran Hotel Colón is but one of dozens of hotels across Europe that are now being repurposed to fight the pandemic.
The US Army Corps of Engineers announced Friday it was working to create more than 10,000 hospital beds in hard-hit New York City by converting hotel rooms and college dormitories into makeshift care facilities.

戈德布拉特将其描述为“一种在日益民族主义的文化中为日本奥运会建立支持的完美观念”。
在这样的背景下，Sandra Collins博士在她的著作《 1940年东京奥运会：失踪的奥运会》中写道，1940年奥运会“在使国际奥委会关于奥林匹克运动具有普遍性的言论合法化方面起到了重要作用。”
1938年7月16日在日本东京的Mantetsu Kaikan决定没收1940年东京奥运会时，对1940年东京奥组委会议的总体看法。
上周，日本副首相甚至在上周告诉议会委员会说，东京2020年被“诅咒了”，他认为奥运会每40年就会因世界特殊事件而中止。
2020年3月24日拍摄的照片显示了今年在福岛展出的东京奥运会的火焰。

Goldblatt described it as the "perfect notion around which to build support for a Japanese Olympics in an increasingly nationalist culture."
In this context, the 1940 Olympics was "instrumental in legitimizing the IOC rhetoric that the Olympic movement was universal," writes Dr. Sandra Collins in her book "The 1940 Tokyo Games: The Missing Olympics."
A general view of the 1940 Tokyo Olympic Organising Committee meeting, when the forfeiture of the 1940 Tokyo Olympic was decided, at Mantetsu Kaikan, on July 16, 1938 in Tokyo, Japan.
Last week, Japan's deputy prime minister even went as far as to tell a parliamentary committee last week that Tokyo 2020 was "cursed," arguing that the Olympics is stopped by extraordinary world events every 40 years.

（CNN）据监视世界珊瑚礁的美国政府科学家称，澳大利亚的大堡礁可能经历了有史以来最广泛的漂白事件。
2016年10月拍摄的文件照片显示澳大利亚大堡礁的珊瑚褪色。
没有什么比大堡礁更重要了。
他说：“这次的情况并不那么激烈，但它的分布范围要广得多，所以我们在大堡礁上都能看到它。”
Eakin说，要使大堡礁完全从已经发生的漂白中恢复过来，将需要数十年的时间。

(CNN) Australia's Great Barrier Reef has likely experienced its most widespread bleaching event on record, according to a US government scientist who monitors the world's coral reefs.
A file photo taken in October 2016 shows coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.
And none is more vital than the Great Barrier Reef.
"This time it is not as intense, but it's much more widespread, so we're seeing it all over the Great Barrier Reef," he said.
For the Great Barrier Reef to fully recover from bleaching that has occurred would take decades, Eakin says.

But she was pleasantly surprised by what she found underneath the wallpaper after Zipper tore through it.
As Jackman pulled away pieces of the wallpaper, she uncovered an elaborate mural that covers the entire room.
"I was just amazed at the scope of it," Jackman, who lives in Casa Grande, Arizona, told CNN.
One wall features a Buddha statue, soaking in some sort of tub with mountains and orangey red puffy clouds in the background.

1943年，克莱尔（Clairol）的一项印刷运动“灰发-无情的独裁者”宣称：“没有正义或仁慈，白发就可以统治你的生活...
尽管灰色可能会在Instagram上流行，但自然的白发在世界范围内的女性和中国的男性中仍然享有盛誉。

This advertisement for Circassian hair dye published in 1843 promises to change light hair into "beautiful" brown or black.
It wasn't until the early 20th century that hair dye as we know it -- chemical, in a rainbow of colors, shop-bought or salon-applied -- came to be.
Two years later, Schueller founded his business, the French Harmless Hair Dye Company -- a name meant to alleviate people's fears of using manufactured hair color.
A Clairol print campaign from 1943, "Gray Hair -- The Heartless Dictator," declared: "Without justice or kindness, gray hair can rule your life...
While gray coloring might trend on Instagram, natural gray hair still has a complicated reputation for women around the world -- and in China, men.

CNNItalian考古学家Vittoria Dall'Armellina由Francesca Giuliani-Hoffman撰写，于2017年访问圣拉撒路修道院时是Ca'Foscari大学的一名博士学位学生。
威尼斯Ca'Foscari大学/安德里亚·阿维兹祖（Andrea Avezzu）礼貌“我立即注意到了，”她告诉CNN。
这把剑被贴上了中世纪的文物标签，但达尔·阿尔梅利纳（Dall'Armellina）直觉这件物品比这件物品古老得多。
为了确认圣拉撒路剑的出身，Dall'Armellina和Rova与修道院的档案研究员塞拉菲诺·贾穆里安神父合作。
威尼斯卡·弗斯卡里大学/安德里亚·阿维祖（Andrea Avezzu）礼貌“多年来，我曾多次参观过这座修道院，但从未注意到这把剑。”

Written by Francesca Giuliani-Hoffman, CNNItalian archaeologist Vittoria Dall'Armellina was a PhD student at Ca' Foscari University in 2017 when she visited the Saint Lazarus monastery.
Courtesy of Ca' Foscari University of Venice/Andrea Avezzu"I noticed it immediately," she told CNN.
The sword was labeled as a medieval artifact, but Dall'Armellina had a hunch that the object was much older than that.
In order to confirm the provenance of the Saint Lazarus sword, Dall'Armellina and Rova partnered with Father Serafino Jamourlian, an archival researcher in the monastery.
Courtesy of Ca' Foscari University of Venice/Andrea Avezzu"I had visited the monastery several times throughout the years and never noticed the sword," Rova said.

伦敦（CNN业务）在印度，电动人力车越来越被视为减少空气污染的一种方式。
摩托车和三轮人力车在印度无处不在，印度政府去年宣布，到2025年将只允许电动两轮和三轮电动车行驶。
首席执行官Amitabh Saran表示，该公司将在“下一季度内”推出首款尚未命名的全电动汽车。
印度政府印度政府已采取措施，通过减税和提供补贴来鼓励购买电动汽车。
他认为，由于廉价进口商品的大量涌入不适合印度“高温，基础设施恶劣和坑洼”的“严酷环境”，电动汽车的声誉不佳。

London (CNN Business) In India, electric rickshaws are increasingly seen as a way to cut air pollution.
Motorbikes and three-wheel rickshaws are ubiquitous in the country, and India's government announced last year that only electric two and three-wheel vehicles would be allowed by 2025.
The company will launch its first — as yet unnamed — fully electric vehicle "within the next quarter," according to CEO Amitabh Saran.
Made in IndiaIndia's government has taken steps to incentivize the purchase of electric vehicles by cutting taxes and offering subsidies .
He believes electric vehicles have a poor reputation due to an influx of cheap imports ill-suited to India's "harsh environment" of "high temperatures, poor infrastructure, and potholes."

那是1945年3月10日凌晨，Nihei刚刚度过了人类历史上最致命的轰炸袭击。
东京居民因1945年3月10日进行的美国空袭“行动会议室”而丧生。
后来空袭被估计是历史上的死胡同。
东京空袭中心的创始人胜本早乙女（Katsumoto Saotome）推动建立一个政府资助的专门针对突袭的国家博物馆。
但是，这些空想的姿态对于空袭幸存者来说还不够。

It was the early morning of March 10, 1945, and Nihei had just survived the deadliest bombing raid in human history.
Tokyo residents who lost their homes as a result of the US bombing air raid "Operation Meetinghouse" conducted on March 10, 1945.
That air raid was later estimated to be the deadlist in history.
Katsumoto Saotome, the founder of the Tokyo Air Raids Center, had pushed for there to be a government-funded state museum dedicated to the raids.
But these small gestures of commemoration are not enough for survivors of the air raids.

## 木摩天大楼革命终于到来了吗？

### Has the wooden skyscraper revolution finally arrived?

Mjøstårnet的高度达到280英尺，于去年开放后成为世界上最高的木材建筑。
长期倡导和设计木制建筑的建筑师Michael Green表示，“现在有很多东西在融合。”
Or Framework是位于俄勒冈州波特兰的一座雄心勃勃的148英尺高的木塔，在去年因成本担忧而被取消之前，该塔被设定为美国最高的木塔。
考虑到在2018年之前，俄勒冈州成为美国第一个允许使用18层木制建筑的州，而在美国，没有任何地方允许任何超过6层的建筑物，这一决定意义重大。
该组织表示，除了担心森林砍伐外，洒水喷头不能有效防止烈焰扩散到木结构建筑中。

Reaching 280 feet in height, Mjøstårnet became the world's tallest timber building upon opening last year.
According to architect Michael Green, a longstanding advocate for -- and designer of -- wooden buildings, there are "a whole bunch of things converging right now."
Or Framework, an ambitious 148-foot-tall timber tower in Portland, Oregon, that was set to be the USA's tallest wooden tower before was canceled amid cost concerns last year.
The decision is significant given that, before 2018, when Oregon became the first US state to allow 18-story wooden buildings, nowhere in America permitted anything higher than six.
In addition to concerns about deforestation, the group says sprinklers are ineffective at preventing blazes from spreading through wood buildings.
