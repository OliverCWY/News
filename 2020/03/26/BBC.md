共和党总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）周三表示，他将在法案通过后立即签署该快速法案。
由于对该法案进行了修订，直到周三才通过，共和党多数党参议院最终以96比0的票数一致通过了该法案。
参议院多数党领袖米奇·麦康奈尔（Mitch McConnell）说，他为没有一个参议员投票反对该法案而感到“自豪”。
共和党和民主党领导人在参议院达成的协议包括退税，贷款，用于医院的钱和救援计划。
众议院民主党发言人南希·佩洛西（Nancy Pelosi）表示，她希望该法案可以通过语音表决获得通过。

President Donald Trump, a Republican, said on Wednesday he would sign the fast-tracked bill as soon as it reached his desk.
With revisions being made to the bill late into Wednesday, the Republican-majority Senate finally, and unanimously, approved it with a 96-0 vote.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he was "proud" that not a single senator voted against the bill.
The agreement reached by Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate includes tax rebates, loans, money for hospitals and rescue packages.
The Democratic speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, said she hoped the bill could be passed by voice vote.

## 冠状病毒：为什么有些国家戴口罩而其他国家不戴口罩

自从冠状病毒爆发以来，一些地方已经完全戴上了口罩，任何被捕的人都没有成为社会贱民的风险。
只有两种类型的人应该戴口罩：那些生病并有症状的人，以及那些正在照料患有冠状病毒的人的人。
它们甚至已成为时尚宣言-一方面，Hello Kitty口罩在香港街头市场风靡一时。
在这些地方不戴口罩的人也受到了耻辱，以至于他们被避开商店和建筑物，并被其遮挡。
面罩可能是近期历史，传染病和文化规范经验的产物。

Since the start of the coronavirus outbreak some places have fully embraced wearing face masks, and anyone caught without one risks becoming a social pariah.
Only two types of people should wear masks: those who are sick and show symptoms, and those who are caring for people who are suspected to have the coronavirus.
They've even become fashion statements - at one point Hello Kitty face masks were the rage in the street markets of Hong Kong.
People who do not wear masks in these places have also been stigmatised, to the point that they are shunned and blocked from shops and buildings.
The face mask may be a product of recent history, experience with contagion and cultural norm.

意大利总理朱塞佩·孔戴（Giuseppe Conte）在全国范围内发布紧急措施时说，我们现在就必须这样做。
在这种情况下，意大利对全国\#iorestoacasa（“我待在家里”）运动的集体拥护不容置疑。
目前，意大利死于冠状病毒的人数比任何其他国家都多，并且已成为抗击这种流行病的全球中心。
如果意大利在过去的几周中向世界传授了任何东西，那就是希望总会赢，文化会持久。

For travel information and stories specifically related to coronavirus, please read the latest updates from our colleagues at BBC News.
We have to do it now,” said Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, as he issued his emergency nationwide measure.
Within this context, Italy’s collective embrace of the nationwide \#iorestoacasa (“I’m staying home”) movement is nothing short of remarkable.
Italy now has more coronavirus deaths than any other nation and has become the global epicentre in the fight against this pandemic.
If Italy has taught the world anything in these last few weeks, it’s that hope always wins and culture endures.

Mayor Bill de Blasio said they would be removed at 80 public courts where people were not respecting social-distancing measures.
These ask people not to shoot around with anyone who is not a member of their households.
“There will not be any basketball games because there will not be any basketball hoops,” he said at a City Hall briefing on Wednesday evening.
On Wednesday, New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo said the city would ban basketball and other contact sports in public parks, Reuters news agency reports.

Bahorik博士告诉我：“他们不断报告说我县的病例很少，但是他们没有进行检测。”
来自全国各地的轶事证据，如Bahorik博士的经验一样，说明了无数美国人进行冠状病毒检测的艰巨性。

"They keep reporting that there are so few cases in my county, but they are not testing," Dr Bahorik tells me.
Anecdotal evidence from every part of the nation, like Dr Bahorik's experience, illustrates how difficult it remains for countless Americans to get a coronavirus test.

美国官员怀疑罗伯特·莱文森被伊朗情报部门绑架。前联邦调查局特工罗伯特·莱文森（Robert Levinson）于13年前在伊朗失踪。
总统补充说：“但是杰出的罗伯特·莱文森（Robert Levinson）病了很长时间。
去年11月，特朗普先生发推文呼吁伊朗移交列文森。
列文森家族在周三发表的声明说，他们最近从美国官员那里获得了情报，这使他们得出结论，说他已经在伊朗羁押中去世。
“如果不是因为伊朗政权的残酷，无情的行动，罗伯特·莱文森今天将还活着并成为我们的家。”

The president added: "But Robert Levinson, who was outstanding, has been sick for a long time.
In November, Mr Trump tweeted calling for Iran to turn over Levinson.
The Levinson family statement on Wednesday said they had recently received information from US officials that had led them to conclude he had died in Iranian custody.
"If not for the cruel, heartless actions of the Iranian regime, Robert Levinson would be alive and home with us today."

与贸易有关的城市州现在似乎正走向大约二十年来的首次全年衰退。
这些数字表明，全球经济也将急剧收缩。
国际货币基金组织（IMF）本周警告说，全球经济衰退要比2008年金融危机后的衰退严重。
在全球金融危机之中，这是自2009年以来东南亚国家最大的季度收缩。
世界各国政府为阻止病毒传播而采取的封锁措施和其他措施正在打击全球经济，许多分析家现在预计将出现长期的深度衰退。

The trade-reliant city state now looks to be heading for its first full-year recession in about two decades.
The figures suggest that the global economy is also set for a sharp contraction.
This week the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned of a global recession worse than the one after the 2008 financial crisis.
It marks the biggest quarterly contraction for the southeast Asian nation since 2009, in the midst of the global financial crisis.
Lockdowns and other measures imposed by governments around the world to slow the spread of the virus are battering the global economy, with many analysts now expecting a deep, long recession.

随着消费者在冠状病毒大流行期间寻找健康产品，橙汁的未来价格本月飙升了20％以上。
这推动了所谓的“未来”橙汁价格上涨，这表明其未来几个月的交货成本。
迄今为止，橙汁期货是表现最好的资产。
自2015年10月以来，橙汁期货的月度涨幅最大，当时全球股市受到重创。
在谈到橙汁期货价格的上涨是否意味着商店中橙汁的价格上涨时，因内斯先生补充说：“随着橙汁生产商将价格上涨的价格转嫁给超级市场和其他买家，传递效应将很快。”

Image copyright Getty ImagesThe future price of orange juice has spiked by more than 20% this month as consumers look for healthy products during the coronavirus pandemic.
This has driven a rise in the so-called "futures" price of orange juice, which indicate its cost for delivery in the coming months.
Orange juice futures are the best performing asset so far this year.
Orange juice futures have seen their biggest monthly gain since October 2015, at a time when global stock markets are being battered.
Talking about whether the spike in orange juice futures prices will mean higher prices for orange juice in shop, Mr Innes added: "The pass-on effect will be quick as orange juice producers pass the price rises onto to supermarkets and other buyers".

对于某些公司和部门，我们谈论的不是减少税收，而是零税收，以及对补贴的需求。
基本上发生了金融骚乱，政府债券不再被视为等同于现金。
保险公司和养老基金需要并需要实际现金，因为随着全球股市下跌，他们的客户要求现金。
这些事件分散了传统客户的政府债务-向国库贷款的现金-现在远远不能保证他们会出席会议。
但是上周，州长安德鲁·贝利（Andrew Bailey）表示：“我们确实关注政府融资需求的影响，以及政府对我们所处危机的非常非常明智的反应。

For some companies and sectors we are talking not about less tax but zero tax, and the need for subsidies.
There is basically a financial riot going on, and government bonds are no longer perceived to be equivalent to cash.
Insurance companies and pension funds want and need actual cash, because their customers ask for it as global stock markets fall.
These events have distracted the traditional customers for government debt - lending cash to the Treasury - who are now far from guaranteed to be at the table.
But last week Governor Andrew Bailey said "we do have an eye on what the effect of the government's financing needs are, and the government's very, very sensible responses to the crisis we're in.

这项要求承担了贷款拖欠企业所有者而非银行的大部分风险。
有些人认为这将阻止企业主利用紧急贷款计划，该计划是政府为防止企业在冠状病毒危机期间破产而采取的。
他告诉英国广播公司（BBC）的“今日”节目，他向银行询问了政府的冠状病毒贷款计划，但提供的服务却大不相同。
他告诉该计划，根据政府的冠状病毒贷款计划，没有人需要借用他们的主要私人住宅作为抵押。
个人担保使银行可以放贷更多，因为这意味着它们更有可能取回资金。

The requirement loads most of the risk that the loan goes bad on the business owner, rather than the banks.
And some think that will stop business owners from making use of the emergency loan scheme, which the government put in place to stop businesses from going under during the coronavirus crisis.
He told the BBC's Today programme that he asked his bank about the government's coronavirus loan scheme, but was offered something quite different.
He told the programme that no-one borrowing money under the government's coronavirus loan scheme would be required to use their main private residence as security.
Personal guarantees allow banks to lend more because it means they are more likely to get their money back.

办公室工作人员的不良卫生状况也会加剧这一情况：2019年英国的一项调查显示，只有61％的英国办公室工作人员上厕所后用温水和肥皂正确洗手。
空气中的病毒肮脏的手指和桌子是一回事，但病毒传播的最大风险是空气中传播的病毒。
“如果一个人生病了，他或她可以通过咳嗽和打喷嚏，触摸表面并紧密接触他人来传播细菌。
办公室的流通空气也可能导致微生物扩散。
这意味着要与生病或接触被感染表面的人接触，然后将其转移到家里的表面。

Poor hygiene from office workers can exacerbate to this, too: a 2019 UK survey showed that only 61% of UK office workers washed their hands properly with warm water and soap after going to the toilet.
A virus in the airDirty fingers and desks are one thing, but the biggest risk for the spread of virus is what’s travelling through the air.
“If one person is sick, he or she could spread the germs through coughing and sneezing, touching surfaces and contacting others closely.
The circulated air of offices can also contribute to the spread of microbes.
That means coming in contact with someone who is sick or touching an infected surface, then transferring it to your surfaces at home.

游行不是造成死亡率差异的唯一原因，但数字表明，在大流行期间采取所谓的“社会隔离”措施的重要性。

尽管Covid-19与西班牙的流感在很多方面都有不同之处，尤其是在影响对象和迄今为止的死亡率方面，但有一个非常重要的教训，即社会隔离可以带来的变化。
