“When there’s lots of limitations, I like it because you have to have more creativity,” says Magnum photographer Carl De Keyzer in this video, describing his images that capture life inside the Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea. De Keyzer was one of very few to have been given unprecedented access to sites in the country, including Pyongyang’s Science and Technology Complex – where hundreds of children gather in ‘pioneer dress’, the communist youth uniforms they wear to school.

He was also allowed to photograph the city’s Mansudae Grand Monument – albeit under heavy restrictions. “One of the rules was, when you take pictures of any statue or monument with the leaders involved, even paintings or portraits, you cannot crop – you have to show everything, the head, the feet, the arms.” Instead, he took photos of them in mist.

Produced by Bruno Boelpaep and Alba Jaramillo
