亨格告诉众议院：“这是具有里程碑意义的一揽子计划，是对特殊情况的必要回应。”
额外的480亿美元几乎占政府2020年1060亿美元预算的一半。
衡先生称，抗灾预算专注于三个关键领域。
他补充说，作为与全球经济高度融合的开放经济，新加坡将受到全球金融冲击的深刻影响。
他说，他将此补充预算命名为“复原力预算”，以反映该国在面对这些挑战时保持复原力的决心。

Mr Heng told the House: "This is a landmark package, and a necessary response to a unique situation."
The additional $48 billion amounts to nearly half of the Government's $106 billion Budget for 2020.
The Resilience Budget, as Mr Heng calls it, focuses on three key areas, Mr Heng said.
As an open economy that is highly integrated with the global economy, Singapore will be deeply impacted by global financial shocks, he added.
He said he named this Supplementary Budget the "Resilience Budget" to reflect the country's determination to remain resilient in the face of these challenges.

吉隆坡（路透社，星/亚洲新闻网）-马来西亚周四（3月26日）报告了235例新的冠状病毒病例，这是其最大的每日跃升，使病例总数达到2,031。
卫生部说，死于冠状病毒的人数上升到23人。
马来西亚的案件总数现已在一周内翻了一番。
马来西亚卫生局局长努尔·希瑟姆·阿卜杜拉（Noor Hisham Abdullah）表示，根据初步调查，这235起案件中有60起与2月下旬在吉隆坡一座清真寺举行的宗教聚会有关。
Datuk Seri Noor Hisham说，重症监护病房总共治疗了45例病例，其中32例需要呼吸机。

KUALA LUMPUR (REUTERS, THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Malaysia on Thursday (March 26) reported 235 new coronavirus cases in its biggest daily jump, bringing the total number of cases to 2,031.
The number of deaths from the coronavirus rose to 23, the Health Ministry said.
Malaysia's total number of cases has now doubled in a week.
Malaysia’s director-general of health Noor Hisham Abdullah said based on preliminary investigations, 60 of the 235 cases were linked to a religious gathering held at a mosque in Kuala Lumpur in late February.
Datuk Seri Noor Hisham said that a total of 45 cases were being treated in the intensive care unit, with 32 of those cases needing ventilators.

东京（路透社）-共同社报道，日本政府正准备最早在星期四（3月26日）下午建立一个专门针对冠状病毒的特别总部，这一步骤可能为宣布疫情紧急状态奠定基础。东京都首府本周的案子急剧上升。
据《日刊新闻》报道，日本首都东京于周四连续第二天报告了40例新的冠状病毒感染病例。
东京都知事小池百合子（Yuriko Koike）周三晚间举行了紧急新闻发布会，警告感染呈爆炸性上升的风险，并要求居民在4月12日之前避免不必要的郊游。
这个城市已经成为日本冠状病毒流行的中心，有250多例。
如果宣布进入紧急状态，则受灾地区的州长将不得不采取措施，例如要求人们呆在家里，关闭学校和其他公共设施以及取消大型活动。

TOKYO (REUTERS) - The Japanese government was preparing to set up a special headquarters on coronavirus as early as Thursday (March 26) afternoon, a step that could set the stage for declaring a state of emergency over the outbreak, Kyodo news agency reported, after the capital of Tokyo saw a sharp rise in cases this week.
The Japanese capital of Tokyo reported more than 40 new cases of coronavirus infections on Thursday for the second day running, Jiji News reported.
Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike late on Wednesday held an emergency news conference to warn of the risk of an explosive rise in infections, asking residents to avoid non-essential outings until April 12.
The city has become the centre of Japan’s coronavirus epidemic, with more than 250 cases.
If a state of emergency is declared, governors in hard-hit regions would have to take steps such as asking people to stay home, closing schools and other public facilities and cancelling large events.

马德里（路透社）-西班牙的冠状病毒封锁已于周四（3月26日）延长至至少4月12日，因为欧洲第二大受灾国正努力应对快速增加的死亡人数。
总理佩德罗·桑切斯在议会上说：“扩大紧急状态并不容易。”
然而，其领导人巴勃罗·卡萨多（Pablo Casado）谴责桑切斯（Sanchez），因为他将其描述为对危机的迟来和不足的反应。
无线电网络Cadena Ser进行的分析发现，至少397名此类房屋的居民死于冠状病毒，占该国3434人死亡人数的10％以上。

MADRID (REUTERS) - Spain's coronavirus lockdown was extended on Thursday (March 26) to last until at least April 12 as Europe's second-worst hit country struggled to tackle a fast increase in the death toll.
"It is not easy to extend the state of emergency," Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in Parliament.
However, its leader Pablo Casado chastised Sanchez for what he described as a late and inadequate response to the crisis.
An analysis by radio network Cadena Ser found at least 397 residents of such homes had died from coronavirus, more than 10 per cent of the country's 3,434 death toll.

The authorities said that Falcone leaned in close to the worker to cough and allegedly laughed, telling her that he was infected with the virus.
Falcone later told two other store employees that they were lucky to have jobs, officials said.
Falcone was charged with making a terroristic threat in the third degree and fourth-degree of obstructing administration of law, Grewal said.
The man was also charged with disorderly conduct and harassment, Murphy said.
The woman, who did not have the coronavirus, was also charged with causing a false public alarm, the authorities said.

日内瓦（路透社）-世界贸易组织（WTO）负责人周三（3月25日）表示，预测显示经济下滑，冠状病毒大流行造成的失业将比2008年的经济衰退更为严重。
他补充说：“最近的预测预测，经济衰退和失业人数将比十年前的全球金融危机还要严重。”
他说，尚无具体预测，但世贸组织内部经济学家预计贸易“将急剧下降”。
不过，他说，各国可以采取重要措施，限制眼前的经济损失，为长期复苏奠定基础，并敦促它们共同努力。
阿兹维多称赞政府在没有命名国家的情况下采取的“积极”刺激措施，并敦促世贸组织成员保持透明并分享信息。

GENEVA (REUTERS) - The World Trade Organisation's (WTO's) chief said on Wednesday (March 25) that projections show the economic downturn and job losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic would be worse than the 2008 recession.
"Recent projections predict an economic downturn and job losses that are worse than the global financial crisis a dozen years ago," he added.
He said concrete forecasts were not yet available, but the WTO's in-house economists expected "a very sharp decline in trade".
However, he said countries could take important steps to limit immediate economic damage and lay the foundations for a long-term recovery, urging them to work together.
Azevedo praised stimulus measures taken by governments as"positive", without naming countries, and also urged WTO members to be transparent and share information.

特别是，已知具有免疫力的医护人员可以继续护理重症患者。
在星期二（3月24日），美国食品药品监督管理局（FDA）批准了使用康复患者的血浆来治疗一些重症患者。
他指出，即使在人体停止产生中和抗体后，免疫记忆细胞的一部分也可以有效地重新激活反应。
克拉默博士说：“在您再次变得有症状之前，您可能会产生良好的免疫反应，并且可能真的使疾病的进程变钝。”
库普曼斯博士说，如果这些样品也显示出对新冠状病毒的免疫反应，那么这也许可以解释为什么有些人（例如儿童）只有轻度的症状。

In particular, healthcare workers who are known to be immune could continue to care for the severely ill.
On Tuesday (March 24), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of plasma from recovered patients to treat some severe cases.
Even after the body stops producing neutralising antibodies, a subset of immune memory cells can reactivate a response effectively, he noted.
"You probably would make a good immune response before you even become symptomatic again and might really blunt the course of the disease," Dr Krammer said.
If those samples show some immune response to the new coronavirus, too, Dr Koopmans said, it might explain why some people - children, for example - have only mild symptoms.

库莫先生说，在他所在的州有30,800多人对该病毒进行了阳性检测，仅在纽约市就有17,800多人对该病毒进行了检测。
库莫先生引用了他所在州最近的冠状病毒住院数字，以证明社会疏远措施开始奏效。

At a news conference, Mr Cuomo said the city also would ban basketball and other contact sports in public parks, urging individuals to comply on a voluntary basis.
"Our closeness makes us vulnerable," said Mr Cuomo, who has emerged as a leading voice on the coronavirus.
Mr Cuomo said more than 30,800 people had tested positive for the virus in his state and more than 17,800 in New York City alone.
Mr Cuomo cited recent coronavirus hospitalisation figures in his state as evidence that social distancing measures were starting to work.
