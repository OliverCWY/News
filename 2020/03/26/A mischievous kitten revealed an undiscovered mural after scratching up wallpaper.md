(CNN) Ceejae Jackman doesn't know why her kitten, Zipper, started scratching up the wall in her spare bedroom.

But she was pleasantly surprised by what she found underneath the wallpaper after Zipper tore through it.

As Jackman pulled away pieces of the wallpaper, she uncovered an elaborate mural that covers the entire room.

Zipper is described as a zany, energetic kitten.

"I was just amazed at the scope of it," Jackman, who lives in Casa Grande, Arizona, told CNN.
