（CNN）在社交媒体上播放的一段视频显示，一名萨拉索塔警官在逮捕期间跪在黑人脖子上后，佛罗里达州警察局发起了一项内部调查。
在5月18日事件中一名旁观者拍摄的近90秒的手机视频中，可以看到三名警官试图将一名男性拘留。
然后看到两名警官之一跪在该男子的头和脖子上。
该录像带浮出水面，是因为乔治·弗洛伊德（George Floyd）死后，全国各地都在举行抗议活动，寻求正义和改革。对乔治·弗洛伊德（George Floyd）的死进行了独立的尸检，结果是官员在他被捕期间跪在他身上。
录像显示，一名警官在弗洛伊德的脖子上膝盖将近九分钟。

(CNN) A Florida police department has launched an internal investigation after a video surfaced on social media showing a Sarasota police officer kneeling on a black man's neck during an arrest.
In the nearly 90-second cellphone video taken by a bystander during the May 18 incident, three officers can be seen attempting to take a male individual into custody.
One of the two officers is then seen kneeling on the head and neck of the man.
The video surfaced as protests are underway across the nation seeking justice and reform in the wake of George Floyd's death, which an independent autopsy attributed to officers kneeling on him during his arrest.
Video showed an officer with a knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes.

"It is true that people of China are on the border.
There has been a disagreement over it ... India has done what it needs to do," Singh said during the interview.

尽管如此，灾难响应小组在登陆之前在马哈拉施特拉邦和古吉拉特邦发起了大规模行动，以从沿海地区疏散超过10万人，其中包括冠状病毒患者，并将他们转移到临时避难所和其他设施。
根据马哈拉施特拉邦国家灾难响应部队（NDRF）指挥官Anupam Srivastava的说法，该响应可能避免了更大的灾难，因为据报道只有一个人在风暴中丧生。
这是一场全国性的悲剧，促使印度对灾难响应机制进行了全面改革。自那以后，灾难的后果就可见一斑。
挽救了生命，但破坏依然广泛为了避免重蹈1999年的悲剧，印度建立了新的灾难应对基础设施。
一年后的2006年，印度成立了国家灾难响应部队（NDRF），这是一支由受过良好训练的男女组成的专门小组，专门处理飓风和地震等灾害。

Nevertheless, disaster response teams launched a large-scale operation in Maharashtra and Gujarat states ahead of landfall to evacuate more than 100,000 people -- including coronavirus patients -- from the coast and move them to temporary shelters and other facilities.
The response may have averted a bigger disaster as only one person is reported to have been killed in the storm, according to Anupam Srivastava, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) commandant in Maharashtra.
It was a national tragedy that spurred an overhaul of India's disaster response apparatus -- the results of which have been visible in disasters since.
Lives saved, but damage remains extensiveTo avoid a repeat of the 1999 tragedy, India created a new disaster response infrastructure.
A year later, in 2006, India established a National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), a specialized corps of highly trained men and women focused on disasters such as cyclones and earthquakes.

That confidence does seem to be there, but the quarantine means businesses can't see a way to appeal to UK visitors.

（CNN）天文学家已经证实了Proxima b的存在，Proxima b是一颗地球大小的系行星，围绕着离我们太阳最近的恒星运行。
研究人员确定，Proxima b是地球质量的1.17倍-并每地球11.2天绕其恒星Proxima Centauri绕一次轨道。
恒星Proxima Centauri，离我们的太阳只有4.2光年。
半人马座Proxima是一颗低质量的红矮星，这意味着即使行星靠近该恒星，它也会从地球接收与太阳相似的能量。
但是，半人马座Proxima是一颗活跃的恒星，它用X射线撞击地球-比地球从太阳接收到的光强多400倍。

(CNN) Astronomers have confirmed the existence of Proxima b, an Earth-size exoplanet orbiting the closest star to our sun.
The researchers determined that Proxima b is 1.17 times the mass of Earth — and completes an orbit around its star, Proxima Centauri, every 11.2 Earth days.
The star, Proxima Centauri, is 4.2 light-years from our sun.
Proxima Centauri is a low-mass red dwarf star, which means that even though the planet is close to the star, it receives similar energy that Earth does from the sun.
However, Proxima Centauri is an active star that lashes the planet with X-rays — 400 times more than Earth receives from the sun.

塔玛拉·哈丁汉姆·吉尔（Tamara Hardingham-Gill）刚到意大利时，我们设想每天晚上都在酒吧和夜总会里闲逛。
每一分钱都值钱，值得庆幸的是，这意味着我们可以花更少的钱在行李箱上。
尽管这些年来我已经多次回到意大利，但我从未能够重现这次旅行的魔力。

Mercifully, this was before we owned digital cameras, otherwise we'd have wasted hours of the trip deleting and retaking pictures.
Tamara Hardingham-GillWhen we first arrived in Italy, we'd envisioned hanging out in bars and nightclubs every evening.

## 宝莱坞为什么在电影中使用冒犯性的进攻手段？

### Why does Bollywood use the offensive practice of brownface in movies?

但它也没有那么讨人喜欢的声誉-促进棕脸的进攻实践。
例如，流行的2019年电影《巴拉》（Bala）讲述了一个女人因肤色而遭受歧视的故事。

演员莎·鲁克·汗（Shah Rukh Khan）经常被称为``宝莱坞之王''，多年来一直为男人们提供一种公平的面霜``公平与英俊''。
Hari认为，宝莱坞（Bollywood）名人可能会做更多的事情，以改变全国各地对深色皮肤的态度。

But it also has a far less flattering reputation -- for promoting the offensive practice of brownface.
For example, the popular 2019 film "Bala" featured the story of a woman who suffered discrimination on the basis of her skin tone.

​Often dubbed the "King of Bollywood," actor Shah Rukh Khan ​endorsed "Fair and Handsome," a fairness cream for men, ​for years.
Hari believes that Bollywood celebrities could be doing much more to change attitudes across the country to dark skin.
