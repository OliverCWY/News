KUALA LUMPUR - Umno president Zahid Hamidi's announcement on Tuesday (June 2) that the party is ready to face an election comes after weeks of rapprochement with his predecessor, Najib Razak, and could spell trouble for Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin and his three-month old Perikatan Nasional (PN) government.

Umno had in February backed Tan Sri Muhyiddin, and his Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia, in order to oust the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition led by Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad.
