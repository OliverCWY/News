他说，两国必须制定一项安排，以防止它们在某些领域的竞争损害其他领域的合作。
即使在1978年中国开始对外开放之后，美洲Pax仍继续保持地位，随着亚洲国家与北京建立贸易和经济联系，其影响力也在不断增强。
一个更强大的中国应该尊重全球规则和规范，也应该为维护国际秩序承担更大的责任。
但他也指出，中国的庞大规模使其成为包括新加坡在内的大多数其他亚洲国家的最大贸易伙伴。
他补充说，亚洲国家与美国和中国的关系并非零和-在加强与北京或华盛顿的关系时，各国并未在相反方面进行工作。

The two powers must work out an arrangement that prevents their rivalry in certain areas from poisoning cooperation in others, he said.
Pax Americana continued to hold even after China began to open up in 1978, with its influence growing as Asian countries built trade and economic links with Beijing.
A more powerful China should respect global rules and norms, and also take greater responsibility for upholding the international order.
But he also pointed out that China's sheer size has made it the largest trading partner of most other Asian countries, including Singapore.
He added that Asian countries' relations with the US and China were not zero-sum - in strengthening ties with Beijing or Washington, countries were not working against the opposite side.

香港（路透社）-香港周四（6月4日）通过了一项法案，该法案将不尊重中国国歌定为刑事犯罪。批评者认为，此举是北京加强对半自治城市的控制的最新迹象。
《国歌》法案要求教育香港的中小学生演唱“志愿者行军”及其历史和礼节。
在立宪制立法机构否决了民主党提出的对国歌法案的大部分修正案之后，立法机构遭到了破坏。
投票通过了，当时香港人为在全市点燃蜡烛来纪念1989年的血腥镇压。
汇丰银行和渣打银行违反了通常的政治中立政策，在周三支持了香港的新法律。

HONG KONG (REUTERS) - Hong Kong passed a bill on Thursday (June 4) that would criminalise disrespect of China’s national anthem, a move critics see as the latest sign of Beijing’s tightening grip on the semi-autonomous city.
The national anthem bill orders that primary and secondary school students in Hong Kong be taught to sing the “March of the Volunteers”, along with its history and etiquette.
The disruption in the legislature came after pro-establishment lawmakers vetoed most amendments to the anthem bill proposed by democrats.
The vote was passed as people in Hong Kong commemorated the bloody 1989 crackdown by lighting candles across the city.
Breaking with their usual policy of political neutrality, HSBC and Standard Chartered banks gave their backing to the new law on Hong Kong on Wednesday.

中国民航总局（CAAC）宣布这一消息之前不久，华盛顿以北京对美国航空公司的限制为由，禁止中国客运航空公司飞往美国。
该声明仅指外国承运人。
美国总统唐纳德·特朗普政府已禁止中国客运航空公司从6月16日开始飞往美国，因为它向北京施压，要求其允许美国航空公司恢复飞往该国的航班。
但是由于美国客运航空公司在3月12日之前停止了所有航班，所以他们无法恢复飞往中国的航班。
美国商务部表示，如果民航局调整其影响美国航空公司的政策，它将重新考虑针对中国航空公司的订单。

The announcement by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) comes shortly after Washington barred Chinese passenger carriers from flying to the United States citing Beijing’s restrictions on American airlines.
The statement simply refers to foreign carriers.
US President Donald Trump’s administration has barred Chinese passenger carriers from flying into America, starting June 16, as it pressures Beijing to let US airlines to resume flights to the country.
But because US passenger airlines stopped all flights by March 12, they have been unable to resume flights to China.
The department has said it would reconsider its order against Chinese airlines if the CAAC adjusts its policies affecting US airlines.

吉隆坡-马来西亚副工务大臣沙鲁德·萨勒（Shahruddin Salleh）辞职，声称加入总理穆罕默德·雅辛（Muhyiddin Yassin）的Perikatan Nasional（PN）政府是错误的，而现在该国政府几乎没有执政。
作为纠正这一错误的第一步，我辞职是由总理从国家警察任命的。”
在PN领导下，3月和5月的议会辩论迄今已被推迟，使得Muhyiddin政府的多数人未经测试。
伯萨图（Bersatu）离开PH和敦马哈迪（Tun Mahathir）辞职后，引发了长达一周的政治危机，3月1日，伯萨图（Bersatu）总统穆希丁（Muhyiddin）宣誓就职。
但是，资深政客和议会反对党领袖安瓦尔·易卜拉欣的支持者也把他的主张当成了最高职位。

KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysia's Deputy Works Minister Shahruddin Salleh has resigned, claiming it was a mistake to join Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin's Perikatan Nasional (PN) government that is now barely clinging on to power.
As an early step to correct this mistake, I am resigning as I was appointed by the Prime Minister from PN," he said.
Under PN, parliamentary debates in March and May have so far been postponed, leaving the Muhyiddin administration's majority untested.
Mr Muhyiddin, Bersatu's president, was sworn in as premier on March 1 after a week-long political crisis sparked by Bersatu's departure from PH and Tun Dr Mahathir's resignation as prime minister.
However, supporters of veteran politician and parliamentary Opposition Leader Anwar Ibrahim have also staked his claim to the top job.

香港（路透社法新社）-警方周四（6月4日）向香港示威者发射了胡椒喷雾，他们抗议中国禁止1989年天安门广场民主镇压的禁令，同时谴责北京也扼杀了他们的自由。
这是香港一年一度的天安门守夜活动中第一次动乱，今年警方以冠状病毒危机为由禁止了这一活动。
在香港，这是几周以来首次报告本地传播的冠状病毒病例。警方曾说，群众集会会破坏公共卫生。
欧盟和美国都对香港示威者纪念天安门周年的愿望表示声援。
我祝愿香港一切顺利。”一群民主运动人士在2020年6月4日前往中国驻东京大使馆时高举香港国旗。

HONG KONG (REUTERS, AFP) - Police fired pepper spray at Hong Kong protesters on Thursday (June 4) who were defying a ban to stage candlelit rallies in memory of China’s 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy crackdown while accusing Beijing of stifling their freedoms too.
It was the first time there had been unrest during the annual Tiananmen vigil in Hong Kong, which police had banned this year citing the coronavirus crisis.
In Hong Kong, which just reported its first locally transmitted coronavirus cases in weeks, police had said a mass gathering would undermine public health.
The European Union and United States both expressed solidarity with the Hong Kong demonstrators’ desire to mark the Tiananmen anniversary.
And I wish Hong Kong well.”A group of pro-democracy activists hold a Hong Kong flag as they march to the Chinese embassy in Tokyo, on June 4, 2020.

Umno had in February backed Tan Sri Muhyiddin, and his Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia, in order to oust the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition led by Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad.

马尼拉-5月初，现年25岁的罗纳尔·马斯（Ronnel Mas）先生在Twitter上的帖子中提供了5000万比索（140万新元）的“奖励”，以奖励罗德里戈·杜特尔特总统的“头”。
这是他目睹的政治荒谬的嘲弄。
但是执法人员迅速走到他的家中，无证逮捕了他，并为他录制了哭泣，恳求和乞求杜特尔特先生怜悯的视频。

MANILA - Early in May, Mr Ronnel Mas, 25, a public school teacher, offered in a post on Twitter a 50 million peso (S$1.4 million) "reward" for President Rodrigo Duterte's "head".
It was a tongue-in-cheek jab at the political inanities he was witnessing.
But law enforcers swiftly descended on his home, arrested him without a warrant and took videos of him crying, pleading and begging for Mr Duterte's mercy.

The other officers charged are Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao.
A charge of second-degree murder does not suggest premeditation but carries stiffer penalties.
Court documents show the second-degree murder charge was added to the prior charges.
The three other officers have been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder, documents show.

孟买（法新社）-据报道，至少有三人死亡，因为受到冠状病毒袭击的孟买似乎躲过了尼萨尔加飓风的最严重破坏（周三，6月3日），这是70年来首次威胁印度金融首都的严重风暴。
旋风从附近沿海城镇的建筑物上撕下屋顶，但似乎使蔓延，拥挤的孟买港口大城市基本安然无left。
气象学家说，风暴于周三下午在孟买以南约100公里的沿海城镇阿里巴格附近登陆。
沿海城市是宝莱坞明星和实业家在这里拥有度假屋的青睐的地方。
孟买是印度受灾最严重的城市，占该国20万多例冠状病毒病例的五分之一。

MUMBAI (AFP) - At least three people were reported dead as coronavirus-hit Mumbai appeared to escape the worst of Cyclone Nisarga Wednesday (June 3), the first severe storm to threaten India's financial capital in more than 70 years.
The cyclone ripped roofs off buildings in nearby coastal towns, but appeared to have left the sprawling, crowded port megacity of Mumbai largely unscathed.
The storm made landfall near the coastal town of Alibag, around 100km south of Mumbai, on Wednesday afternoon, meteorologists said.
The coastal town is a favoured haunt of Bollywood stars and industrialists, who own holiday homes there.
Mumbai is India's worst-hit city, home to a fifth of the country's more than 200,000 coronavirus cases.

奥巴马先生的言论针对的是年轻的黑人和妇女，他说这些黑人经常目睹或经历过太多暴力。
奥巴马在与维权人士的网络广播中说：“暴力行为中有些经常来自本应为您服务和保护您的人。”
奥巴马说：“心态正在发生变化，人们更加认识到我们可以做得更好。”
奥巴马并没有直接谈到特朗普对动乱的处理，包括总统的有争议的要求，即当局“主导”抗议者。
但据报道，周一在特朗普走进附近的教堂并举起圣经之前，奥巴马对白宫外的抗议者使用化学分散剂感到愤怒。

Mr Obama directed his comments at young black men and women who he says have often witnessed or experienced too much violence.
"Too often some of that violence has come from folks who were supposed to be serving and protecting you," Mr Obama said in a webcast with activists.
"There is a change in mindset that's taking place, a greater recognition that we can do better," Mr Obama said.
Mr Obama did not directly address Mr Trump's handling of the unrest, including the president's controversial demand that authorities "dominate" protesters.
But Mr Obama was reportedly outraged by the use of chemical dispersants on protesters outside the White House Monday before Mr Trump walked to a nearby church and held up a Bible.

Cha Cha Massage的按摩师Nirun Thongkuntong先生说：“这是因为尚未允许外国游客进入该国。”
日落时分，在Cha Cha按摩中看到一些当地顾客。
由于社会疏远措施，按摩室只能将相隔1.5米的椅子容纳一半。
主人在Charawi按摩院里，在椅子和床之间放上用PVC管和塑料板制成的隔板。
根据泰国公共卫生部的统计，全国有超过15万名按摩治疗师和近10,000家按摩店在该部注册。

"It's because foreign tourists are not allowed into the country yet," said Mr Nirun Thongkuntong, a masseur at Cha Cha massage.
By sunset, a few local customers were seen inside Cha Cha massage.
Because of social distancing measures, the massage parlours are only allowed half their capacity with chairs placed 1.5 metres apart.
At Charawi massage parlour, the owner put up partitions, made from PVC pipes and plastic sheets, between chairs and beds.
According to Thailand's Public Health Ministry, there are over 150,000 massage therapists and nearly 10,000 massage parlours registered with the ministry across the country.
