BEIJING (REUTERS, AFP) - China on Thursday (June 4) said it would allow foreign airlines currently blocked from operating in the country over coronavirus concerns to resume limited flights, lifting a de facto ban on US carriers.

The announcement by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) comes shortly after Washington barred Chinese passenger carriers from flying to the United States citing Beijing’s restrictions on American airlines.

The CAAC said in a statement that qualifying foreign carriers currently barred from operating flights to mainland China will be allowed once-per-week flights into a city of their choosing, starting next Monday. The statement simply refers to foreign carriers. It does not mention US airlines specifically.

Hong Kong and Macau, though part of China, have their own aviation authorities and set their own rules. US President Donald Trump’s administration has barred Chinese passenger carriers from flying into America, starting June 16, as it pressures Beijing to let US airlines to resume flights to the country.

A so-called "Five One" policy allows mainland carriers to fly just one flight a week on one route to any country and foreign airlines to operate just one flight a week to a city in China.

Carriers can also fly no more than the number of flights in a weekly schedule approved by the CAAC on March 12.

But because US passenger airlines stopped all flights by March 12, they have been unable to resume flights to China.

Mr Trump’s administration on Wednesday said it would bar Chinese passenger carriers from flying into America from June 16, pressuring Beijing to let US airlines to resume flights to the country.

The US Department of Transportation could not be immediately reached for comment.

The department has said it would reconsider its order against Chinese airlines if the CAAC adjusts its policies affecting US airlines.

The CAAC said all airlines will be allowed to increase the number of international flights involving China to a maximum of two per week if no passengers on their flights test positive for Covid-19 for three consecutive weeks.

If five passengers or more on one flight test positive for the coronavirus upon arrival, the CAAC would bar the airline from services for a week, it said.

Airlines would be suspended for four weeks if 10 passengers or more test positive.

CAAC deputy director Li Jian said in May that the agency would consider increasing international flights, after public criticisms of its "Five One" policy, which has led to exorbitant ticket prices for many Chinese stranded overseas.

China has also suspended the entry of foreigners with valid Chinese visas or residence permits since late March, meaning only Chinese nationals can travel back to the country on commercial passenger flights.
