Public faith in Swedish authorities has dropped significantly, as the coronavirus crisis continues, according to a new survey by major pollsters Novus.

The proportion of respondents who had very or fairly high confidence in the government’s ability to deal with Covid 19 has slumped to 45% compared with 63% in the company’s last major survey in April.

Confidence in the Swedish Public Health Authority, led by state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has dropped to 65%, down from 73%. However faith in the country’s health care services remain high, with 80% of people surveyed reporting very or fairly high confidence, compared to 84% in April.

Sweden’s unusual response to the virus, which has involved keeping large parts of society open and relying largely on social distancing measures, has sparked debate around the world.

In more recent weeks the government has faced criticism over the high death toll in care homes and failing to test 100,000 people a week as it had promised.
