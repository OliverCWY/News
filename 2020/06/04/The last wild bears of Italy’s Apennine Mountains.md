At daybreak, Ellie Parker regularly skins up the mountain with her father to get some ski runs in. In early May, they ran into some unexpected visitors. Cresting a ridge on Colorado’s Aspen Highlands resort, Parker spotted six mountain goats dotted across the ski slope, calmly gazing at her. After a few moments, the herd meandered over to a red rocky cliff and scaled the boulders. Parker has been skiing here for 24 years, and she’s never seen mountain goats in the middle of the ski resort.

Throughout lockdown, stories have been circulating of wildlife profiting from the hiatus in human activity. In Colorado, bears and coyotes were spotted wandering downtown streets. In the valley, local residents were warned to keep their pets leashed because there have been more reported sightings of mountain lions and black bears.

For activists and scientists concerned about the impact of the ski industry on wildlife, such sightings are bittersweet; as lockdowns ease, these wild animals will again be constrained by human activity.

There is a certain threshold of human activity that many species of wildlife can tolerate. Grooming ski runs has been shown to disturb lizard habitats in Australia. Capercaillie and black grouse in the Alps show elevated levels of stress near ski resorts and off-piste routes. But here in Colorado, there is an attitude to wilderness that might help solve a conservation problem in mountains thousands of miles away – in central Italy

An Apennine problem

A case in point comes not from Colorado but from a ski resort expansion in Italy’s Apennine Mountains, on the doorstep of a critically endangered bear: the Marsican brown bear. The Central Apennines, which run nearly the length of the Italian peninsula, are home to the only 50-60 wild Marsican brown bears known today. Four planned ski resort development projects have been proposed within their habitat.
