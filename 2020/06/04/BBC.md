马蒂斯（Mattis）谴责特朗普（Donald Trump）的“滥用职权”-以及支持前总统巴拉克·奥巴马（Barack Obama）寻求维护美国价值观的抗议者。
特朗普先生一再描述马蒂斯为“高估的将军”。
在特朗普决定将美军撤出叙利亚后，马蒂斯先生于2018年辞职。
关于乔治·弗洛伊德（George Floyd）逝世的更多信息为回应新的批评，特朗普先生发布了一系列推文，其中他声称已解雇了马蒂斯先生。
在发生争吵之际，对在明尼阿波利斯市弗洛伊德先生去世时在场的所有被解职警察提出了新指控。

Mr Mattis berated Mr Trump's "abuse of authority" - and backed protesters seeking to uphold American values, as did ex-President Barack Obama.
Mr Trump has described Mr Mattis repeatedly as an "overrated general".
Mr Mattis quit in 2018 after Mr Trump decided to pull US troops out of Syria.
More on George Floyd's deathIn response to the fresh criticism, Mr Trump posted a series of tweets in which he claimed to have fired Mr Mattis.
The row comes as new charges were brought against all of the sacked police officers present at Mr Floyd's death in the city of Minneapolis.

2020年2月，泰勒（Taylor）参观了位于奥地利萨尔茨卡默古特（Salzkammergut）地区的哈尔施塔特（Hallstatt）村，该村因其美丽的风景而受到Instagram使用者和影响者的喜爱。
每年的这个时候，将近800人的村庄通常会向近10,000名每日游客开放。
哈尔施塔特（Hallstatt）居民索尼亚·卡塔琳娜（Sonja Katharina）说：“这就像住在一个幽灵村庄。”
哈尔施塔特盐矿首席执行官库尔特·雷格（Kurt Reiger）表示：“哈尔施塔特一直是旅游热点，因此很多人失业或减少了工作时间。”
但是对于泰勒来说，哈尔施塔特并没有失去使其特别之处，即使它仍然不受限制。

In February 2020, Taylor visited the village of Hallstatt, located in Austria’s Salzkammergut region, that’s beloved by Instagrammers and influencers for its scenic beauty.
At this time of year, the village of near 800 people would ordinarily open its doors to almost 10,000 daily visitors.
“It was like living in a ghost village,” said Hallstatt resident Sonja Katharina.
“Hallstatt has always been a tourist hot spot, so a lot of people have lost their work or have reduced working hours,” said Kurt Reiger, CEO of the Hallstatt salt mine.
But for Taylor, Hallstatt hasn’t lost what makes it special, even if it remains off limits “Hallstatt is particularly unique,” she said.

帕克在科罗拉多州阿斯彭高地度假胜地的山脊上攀登，发现六只山山羊点缀在滑雪场上，平静地凝视着她。
帕克（Parker）在这里滑雪已有24年了，她从未在滑雪胜地的中间见过山羊。
在山谷中，当地居民被警告要养宠物，因为据报导有更多的山狮和黑熊被目击到。
中亚平宁山脉的长度接近意大利半岛的长度，是今天已知的仅50-60只野生马其顿棕熊的所在地。
已在其栖息地内提出了四个计划中的滑雪胜地开发项目。

Cresting a ridge on Colorado’s Aspen Highlands resort, Parker spotted six mountain goats dotted across the ski slope, calmly gazing at her.
Parker has been skiing here for 24 years, and she’s never seen mountain goats in the middle of the ski resort.
In the valley, local residents were warned to keep their pets leashed because there have been more reported sightings of mountain lions and black bears.
The Central Apennines, which run nearly the length of the Italian peninsula, are home to the only 50-60 wild Marsican brown bears known today.
Four planned ski resort development projects have been proposed within their habitat.

路透社版权：路透社（Reuters）根据主要民意测验机构Novus的一项新调查，随着冠状病毒危机的持续，公众对瑞典当局的信心大大下降。
对政府处理Covid 19的能力抱有非常或相当高的信心的受访者比例已降至45％，而该公司上一次四月份的主要调查中这一比例为63％。
由国家流行病学家安德斯·特涅尔（Anders Tegnell）领导的瑞典公共卫生局的信心从73％下降至65％。
但是，对该国医疗保健服务的信心仍然很高，接受调查的人们中有80％表示非常或相当高的信心，而4月份该数字为84％。
在最近的几周中，政府因养老院的高死亡人数而面临批评，并且未能如承诺的那样每周测试10万人。

Reuters Copyright: ReutersPublic faith in Swedish authorities has dropped significantly, as the coronavirus crisis continues, according to a new survey by major pollsters Novus.
The proportion of respondents who had very or fairly high confidence in the government’s ability to deal with Covid 19 has slumped to 45% compared with 63% in the company’s last major survey in April.
Confidence in the Swedish Public Health Authority, led by state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has dropped to 65%, down from 73%.
However faith in the country’s health care services remain high, with 80% of people surveyed reporting very or fairly high confidence, compared to 84% in April.
In more recent weeks the government has faced criticism over the high death toll in care homes and failing to test 100,000 people a week as it had promised.

抗议活动已经在美国各地进行了数天，预计数百人将在明尼阿波利斯参加为非裔美国人乔治·弗洛伊德（George Floyd）举行的纪念活动。
周三宣布了新的指控，指控在弗洛伊德死后在场的所有四名已被解职的军官。
这项赛事是在弗洛伊德去世的北部城市明尼阿波利斯举行的，是向他致敬的几场比赛中的第一场。
46岁的乔治·弗洛伊德（George Floyd）于5月25日在明尼阿波利斯（Minneapolis）被警方调查以假币购买卷烟而制止。
对于许多人来说，对弗洛伊德之死的愤怒也反映了人们对社会经济不平等和歧视的无奈之情。

New charges were announced on Wednesday against all four of the now sacked officers present at Floyd's death.
The event, in the northern city of Minneapolis where Floyd died, is the first of several to honour him.
George Floyd, 46, was stopped by police investigating the purchase of cigarettes with counterfeit money on 25 May in Minneapolis.
For many, the outrage over Floyd's death also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination.

在第二次世界大战以来最大的经济衰退中，欧洲央行采取了进一步的戏剧性措施，试图提振欧元区经济。
在采取紧急措施仅几个月后，中央银行表示将把其债券购买计划的规模增加6000亿欧元（合5460亿英镑），至13.5亿欧元。
央行还决定将其利率保持在历史最低水平。
购买债券通常被称为量化宽松（QE）。
一些市场评论家想知道可以安全地打印多少钱而不会导致钱币价值下降。

Just months after emergency measures, the central bank said it would increase the size of its bond buying programme by €600bn (£546bn) to €1.35tn.
The central bank also decided to hold its interest rates at record lows.
The bond purchases are often referred to as Quantitative Easing (QE).
Some market commentators wonder how much money can safely be printed without causing the value of money to decrease.

图片由PA Media德国联邦政府同意，一项1300亿欧元（合1140亿英镑）的财政刺激方案削减税收，将每个孩子的300欧元交​​给每个家庭。
此举旨在启动受到冠状病毒危机严重打击的经济。
每个孩子的家庭将获得300欧元的一次性汇款。
新的刺激计划是在三月份商定的1.1万亿欧元救助计划的基础上，该计划包括贷款担保，补贴和缩短工时计划，以避免裁员。
默克尔夫人说，这项支持计划将帮助“经济站稳脚跟，重新成长”。

Image copyright PA MediaGermany's coalition government has agreed a €130bn (£114bn) fiscal stimulus package which cuts tax and hands €300 per child to every family.
The move is designed to kick-start the economy which has been severely hit by the coronavirus crisis.
Families will receive a one-time transfer of €300 for each child.
The new stimulus package comes on top of a €1.1 trillion rescue package agreed in March, which comprised loan guarantees, subsidies and a shorter-hours programme to avoid job cuts.
Mrs Merkel said the support programme would help "the economy to find its feet and grow again".

汇丰银行（HSBC）在中国社交媒体上的一篇文章中表示，“尊重并支持稳定香港社会秩序的所有法律。”
汇丰银行于1993年将总部迁至伦敦，而香港仍然是其最大的市场。
人们还担心有关中国可能在香港设立自己的负责安全的机构的建议。
汇丰银行此前曾卷入香港的反政府抗议活动，其分支机构遭到破坏，总部外的青铜狮子雕像在1月的抗议游行中遭到破坏。

HSBC "respects and supports all laws that stabilise Hong Kong's social order," it said in a post on social media in China.
While HSBC moved its headquarters to London in 1993, Hong Kong is still its biggest market.
People are also worried about suggestions that China could set up its own institutions in Hong Kong responsible for security.
HSBC had been previously caught up in Hong Kong's anti-government protests, with its branches vandalised and bronze lion statues outside its headquarters defaced during a protest march in January.

LVMH去年11月同意收购Tiffany，但冠状病毒引起的金融市场动荡使该交易黯然失色。
经过几天的猜测，LVMH周四表示不会在公开市场上购买蒂芙尼股票。
蒂芙尼（Tiffany）的股价在3月份下跌，原因是人们对其奢侈珠宝的销售预期有所下降。
它补充说：“考虑到最近的市场传闻，LVMH确认这次不考虑在市场上购买蒂芙尼股票。”
蒂芙尼（Tiffany）是纽约的一家机构，其旗舰店毗邻第五大道的特朗普大厦（Trump Tower）。

LVMH agreed to acquire Tiffany last November, but coronavirus-induced turmoil on financial markets has overshadowed the deal.
After days of speculation, LVMH said on Thursday that it would not buy Tiffany shares on the open market.
Tiffany's share price tumbled in March on the back of expectation that sales of its luxury jewellery would fall.
It added: "Considering the recent market rumours, LVMH confirms, on this occasion, that it is not considering buying Tiffany shares on the market."
Tiffany is something of a New York institution and its flagship store is next to Trump Tower on 5th Avenue.

在冠状病毒加剧了业务面临的压力之后，Debenhams在4月的一年中第二次倒台。
但是，在解除冠状病毒锁定限制后，将永久关闭17家商店。
Debenhams董事总经理史蒂文·库克（Steven Cook）表示：“我们很高兴在接下来的几周内欢迎客户回到我们的商店。
“我们的重新开设计划是在成功完成120家商店的租赁谈判之后的，这意味着我们的绝大多数商店都将重新开业。”
当德本汉姆斯（Debenhams）倒台后，该公司欠债权人1.55亿英镑，其中包括许多供应商。

Debenhams collapsed into administration for the second time in a year in April after coronavirus ramped up the pressures facing the business.
However, 17 stores will remain closed for good when coronavirus lockdown restrictions are lifted.
Steven Cook, managing director of Debenhams, said: "We are delighted to be welcoming customers back to our stores in the coming weeks.
"Our reopening plans follow the successful conclusion of lease negotiations on 120 stores, meaning that the vast majority of our stores will be reopening."
When Debenhams collapsed into administration, the business owed £155m to creditors, including many suppliers.
