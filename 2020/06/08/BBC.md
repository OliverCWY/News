特朗普总统的回应是称鲍威尔先生“被高估了”。
鲍威尔周日在美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）的国情咨文中说：“我们有一部宪法。

Referring to President Trump, the retired four-star general said: "He lies about things, and he gets away with it because people will not hold him accountable."
Mr Powell, who is seen as a moderate Republican, did not vote for Mr Trump in the 2016 poll.

1967年11月7日，《海峡时报》的标题大喊“不要害怕科罗”。
成千上万的人自发地相信自己的阴茎正在缩小-并且这种损失最终会杀死他们。
街上有话说，突然的阴茎枯萎是由男人吃的东西引起的。
Koro的历史可以追溯到数千年前，但最近一次爆发是在2015年，发生在印度东部。
几十年来，像这样的“不可翻译的”疾病被当作纯粹的科学好奇心进行研究，这种疾病存在于世界上人们显然不了解的地方。

“DO NOT FEAR KORO,” screamed the headline in the Straits Times newspaper on November 7, 1967.
Thousands of men had spontaneously become convinced that their penises were shrinking away – and that the loss would eventually kill them.
The word on the street was that the sudden penis withering was caused by something the men had eaten.
Koro has a history stretching back thousands of years, but the most recent outbreak occurred in 2015, in eastern India.
For decades, “untranslatable” disorders like these were studied as mere scientific curiosities, which existed in parts of the world where people apparently didn’t know any better.

Our pickup truck turned onto a dusty two-track road heading away from the Nile River in north-eastern Sudan.
Wondering if it was the desert playing tricks on me, my doubts dissipated when we rounded a corner and stopped.
Surrounding us, on every exposed surface of rock, were thousands of ancient petroglyphs depicting scenes of elephants, giraffes, ostriches and boats.
“Sabu has a large diversity of figures,” said archaeologist Dr Bruce Williams, who worked in Sudan for more than 50 years.
“Most big outcrops, especially those with caves, are often spectacularly developed.” While the imagery is widespread across Sudan, Sabu remains one of the largest known concentrations in the country.

英国制药业警告过英国，冠状病毒大流行已“完全用完”了医疗用品的库存。
英国广播公司（BBC）看到的一份备忘录建议政府购买和储存用于治疗该病毒的“关键”药物。
大流行导致对以前没有用于重症监护和呼吸道药物的药物（如吸入器）的需求大量增加。
长期以来，制药行业一直期待无交易的英国退欧会导致多佛和加来港口的交通拥挤，这是90％的欧盟进口药物和药品到达英国的途径。
鉴于预计在英国退欧过渡期结束时边境中断，制药行业预计将重新建立无交易的政府特许货运渡轮和飞机系统。

Image copyright Getty ImagesThe UK has been warned by the pharmaceutical industry that stockpiles of medical supplies have been "used up entirely" by the coronavirus pandemic.
A memo seen by the BBC advises the government to buy and store "critical" medicines to treat the virus.
The pandemic has led to a massive increase in demand for medicines not previously stockpiled for critical care and respiratory medicines, such as inhalers.
The pharmaceutical industry has long anticipated that a no-deal Brexit could cause congestion at the ports of Dover and Calais, which is the route that 90% of imported drugs and medicines from the EU take to get to the UK.
The pharmaceutical industry is expecting the system of no-deal government-chartered freight ferries and aeroplanes to be re-established, given that border disruption is expected at the end of the Brexit transition period.

华为正在发起报纸和互联网运动，以纪念在英国开展20年的业务。
在进行新的安全审查之前，英国政府可能会禁止使用华为的5G网络套件。
华为当地老板表示，他希望英国为国家利益行事。
这项举措是在周六的《每日电讯报》（Daily Telegraph）上报道的。该报称，总部位于伦敦的汇丰银行（HSBC）担心，如果英国对华为采取行动，它将在中国遭到报复。
张建宗告诉英国广播公司：“我们认为这一决定将严重影响半导体产业的全球供应链。”

It comes amid a new security review that could lead the UK government to ban use of Huawei's 5G network kit.
Huawei's local boss said he expects the UK to act in the nation's interests.
The initiative follows a report in Saturday's Daily Telegraph, which said London-headquartered bank HSBC fears it could face reprisals in China, if the UK acts against Huawei.
"We think this decision will heavily impact on the global supply chain of the semiconductor industry," Mr Zhang told the BBC.

美国前财政部长表示，随着世界从冠状病毒危机的经济影响中复苏，公共投资将是关键。
“公共投资政策将发挥更大的作用。”
但关键的是，低通胀，低利率和低收益率使政府在这场危机后能够维持更高水平的借款。”
但是伦敦大学学院（UCL）创新与公共目标研究所所长Mariana Mazzucato教授表示，任何公共支出项目都必须重点突出。
政府有“上手”。“如果问题一经出现就一直解决问题，那么从一场危机到另一场危机-金融危机，气候危机，健康危机-我们将不会摆脱困境。这种持续的危机模式。”她说。

"And public investment policies are going to play a larger part."
But the key thing is that low inflation, low rates and low yields allows the government to sustain a much higher level of borrowing after this crisis."
But Professor Mariana Mazzucato, Director of the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose at University College London (UCL), says it is vital that any public spending project is well-focused.
Government has the 'upper hand'"If we keep just arriving to the problem once the problem presents itself, so from one crisis to another - the financial crisis, the climate crisis, the health crisis - we're not going to get out of this constant crisis mode," she said.

飞行员工会巴尔帕（Balpa）指责英国航空公司威胁要解雇并根据新合同重新雇用其成员，从而破坏了拟议的失业计划。
与一些工会（包括Unite和GMB）不同，Balpa一直在与该公司举行会议，BA表示拒绝参加谈判。
但是巴尔帕秘书长布赖恩·斯特顿（Brian Strutton）周六晚说，这些谈话现在“挂在嘴边”。
“然后，在星期三晚上，广管局的一封信又增加了125个工作岗位，而且如果我们未就条款和条件的变更达成协议，这也是第一次威胁要解雇和重新聘用4300名广管局飞行员。
“我对英国航空公司对巴尔帕代表及其飞行员所表现出的勇敢态度感到震惊。

Image copyright Getty ImagesThe pilots' union Balpa has accused British Airways of undermining talks over proposed job losses by threatening to dismiss and re-hire its members under new contracts.
Balpa has been meeting with the company, unlike some unions, including Unite and GMB, which BA says have refused to enter talks.
But Balpa general secretary Brian Strutton said on Saturday night that those talks now hung "by a thread".
"Then, on Wednesday evening, a letter from BA added another 125 job losses and also for the first time threatened all 4,300 BA pilots with dismissal and reengagement if we did not reach agreement on changes to terms and conditions.
"I'm appalled at the cavalier attitude shown by BA towards the Balpa reps and to its pilots.
