A coal mine in Poland is behind a recent spike in the country's confirmed virus cases.

Over the weekend 1,151 new infections were recorded nationally. An outbreak among miners and their families at the Zofiowka colliery in southern Poland accounted for two-thirds of that figure.

Poland introduced a strict lockdown early in March, and has avoided the comparatively large numbers of deaths seen in Western Europe.

Overall, 1,157 people have died from Covid-19 - and 26,561 have been infected.
