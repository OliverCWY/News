但是，在警务和刑事司法方面，美国是一个明显的异常地区，黑人受到的影响尤其严重。
在发达国家，有关逮捕，死亡和监狱人口的数据并不统一，因此很难准确地确定美国与每个国家相比的票价。
英国内政部称，这些措施是与美国逮捕相关死亡人数最准确的比较。
在被警察面对或逮捕的人中，美国黑人更有可能受到武力-这是抗议者在美国游行的主要抱怨。
黑人美国人占美国监狱人口的三分之一，尽管仅占该国总人口的八分之一左右。

But when it comes to policing and criminal justice, the US is a noticeable outlier, and black Americans are disproportionately affected.
Data on arrests, deaths and prison populations do not exist uniformly across developed countries, so it can be difficult to pinpoint exactly how the US fares in comparison to every nation.
Those measures are the most accurate comparison to the US's figure of arrest-related deaths, according to the UK Home Office.
Of those confronted or arrested by police, black Americans are more likely to be subjected to force -- a key complaint of the protesters marching across the US.
Black Americans make up a third of the US prison population, despite only making up around an eighth of the country's total population.

## 消极思维与以后的痴呆症有关，但您可以学会变得更积极

### Negative thinking linked to dementia in later life, but you can learn to be more positive

一项新的研究发现，在以后的生活中重复性的负面思考与认知能力下降和导致阿尔茨海默氏病的两种有害蛋白质的大量沉积有关。
在过去的两年中，对超过350名55岁以上的人进行了负面思考，例如对过去的反思和对未来的担忧。
马尔坎特说：“与其他将抑郁症和焦虑症与痴呆症风险联系在一起的研究一起，我们期望长期的长期消极思维方式会增加痴呆症的风险。”
研究人员建议，诸如冥想之类的心理训练方法可能有助于促进积极思考，同时减少消极思想，并且他们计划进行进一步的研究以检验其假设。
Inserm /卡昂－诺曼底大学的合著者GaelChételat博士说：“我们的思想会对我们的身体健康产生生物学影响，可能是积极的，也可能是消极的。

A new study found that repetitive negative thinking in later life was linked to cognitive decline and greater deposits of two harmful proteins responsible for Alzheimer's disease.
Negative thinking behaviors such as rumination about the past and worry about the future were measured in over 350 people over the age of 55 over a two-year period.
"Taken alongside other studies, which link depression and anxiety with dementia risk, we expect that chronic negative thinking patterns over a long period of time could increase the risk of dementia," Marchant said.
The researchers suggest that mental training practices such as meditation might help promoting positive thinking while reducing negative thoughts, and they plan future studies to test their hypothesis.
"Our thoughts can have a biological impact on our physical health, which might be positive or negative, said coauthor Dr. Gael Chételat of Inserm/ Université de Caen-Normandie.

纽约（CNN商业资讯）在Covid-19封锁期间，美国经济正在重新开放，劳动力市场在经历了巨大损失之后反弹。
参加6月美国国家商业经济学协会经济展望展望调查的经济学家最多（87％）认为，第二波感染可能会危害反弹，并成为今年美国经济的最大危险。
企业关门大吉，裁员数百万人，导致4月份有记录的最大失业人数为2070万。
但是，经济的缓慢重启可能会导致高度传染性病毒重新传播。
反过来，这可能导致第二次锁定，这将带来更多的经济痛苦。

New York (CNN Business) The US economy is reopening and the labor market is bouncing back after dramatic losses during the height of the Covid-19 lockdown.
The lion's share of economists participating in the June National Associate of Business Economics Outlook Survey — 87% — believe a second wave of infections could imperil a rebound and become the biggest danger to America's economy this year.
Businesses shuttered and laid off millions of people, leading to the steepest job losses on record — 20.7 million — in April.
But the staggered restart of the economy could lead to renewed spreading of the highly contagious virus.
This could, in turn, lead to a second lockdown that would bring yet more economic pain.

在这张由航拍视频拍摄的图像中，喷气式滑雪板经过了一条鲨鱼，沿着一条鲨鱼在澳大利亚新南威尔士州金斯克里夫海岸游泳，2020年6月7日星期日。
据新南威尔士州冲浪救生组织称，这名来自昆士兰州的男子在新南威尔士州最北海岸的金斯克里夫附近的盐滩冲浪时被杀死。
周日上午10点后不久，警方和紧急响应人员被告知，一名男子在海滩上遭到袭击。
Kingscliff镇和Cabarita镇之间的海滩将关闭24小时。

Shortly after 10 a.m. on Sunday, police and emergency responders were notified that a man had been attacked on the beach.
Beaches between the towns of Kingscliff and Cabarita will close for 24 hours.

（CNN）美国卫生与公共服务部官员罗伯特·卡德莱茨（Robert Kadlec）博士对CNN表示，美国政府目前提供的唯一可对抗Covid-19的药物remdesivir将于本月底用完。
政府的最后一批毒品将于6月29日当周运出。
生产这种药物的公司吉利德科学公司（Gilead Sciences）正在加大产量，但目前尚不清楚今年夏天将有多少可用。
上个月，美国食品和药物管理局（FDA）紧急批准了remdesivir（一种用于研究埃博拉病毒的静脉抗病毒药物，现已用于住院的Covid患者）。
一项不是重磅炸弹的药物，一项研究表明，它可以将住院时间从15天缩短至11天，减少4天。

(CNN) The US government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against Covid-19, will run out at the end of the month, Dr. Robert Kadlec, a US Department of Health and Human Services official, told CNN.
The government's last shipment of the drug will go out the week of June 29.
Gilead Sciences, the company that makes the drug, is ramping up to make more, but it's unclear how much will be available this summer.
Last month, the US Food and Drug Administration gave emergency authorization for remdesivir, an intravenous antiviral medication studied to treat Ebola but now used on hospitalized Covid patients.
While not a blockbuster drug, a study shows it shaves four days off a hospital stay, from 15 to 11 days.

那不可能实现，因为医生不会开绿灯，如果没有药物，那将是缓慢而痛苦的死亡。
大卫告诉我，如果他患了辛迪的所有疾病，那么几年前他会一直在寻找出路。
她认为助人死亡与精神指南针“契合”。对于她来说，她所祈求的温和，和平的死亡在田纳西州完全是非法的。
辛迪告诉我，这样的陈述使她意识到死亡的帮助“与我的精神指南针相符”。
在大卫的最后一个早上，一名司机于上午9:30从他们的旅馆接了大卫和辛迪，大卫后来告诉我。

That couldn't come to fruition because doctors wouldn't greenlight what would have still been a slow and painful death without the meds.
David told me that if he had suffered all the diseases Cindy had, he would have been looking for a way out years ago.
She believed assisted death 'aligned' with her spiritual compassFor her, the gentle, peaceful death she prayed for was simply unlawful in Tennessee.
Statements like that, Cindy told me, helped her realize that assistance with dying "was something that aligned with my spiritual compass."
On her final morning, a driver picked up David and Cindy from their hotel at 9:30 a.m., David told me later.

创立寻宝活动的89岁的艺术和古物收藏家福雷斯特·芬恩（Forrest Fenn）周日在其网站上宣布了这一消息。
芬恩在声明中写道：“它落在洛矶山脉茂密，森林茂密的植被中的星冠下，并没有移到我藏匿它的地方十多年前。”
“我不知道发现它的人，但我书中的诗将他引到了确切的位置。”
芬恩告诉圣达菲《新墨西哥人》，几天前，一个不愿透露姓名的人发现了这件宝藏。

(CNN) Thousands of brave souls have ventured into the Rocky Mountains for the past decade, searching for a treasure chest filled with gold, rubies, emeralds and diamonds.
Forrest Fenn, the 89-year-old art and antiquities collector who created the treasure hunt, made the announcement Sunday on his website.
"It was under a canopy of stars in the lush, forested vegetation of the Rocky Mountains and had not moved from the spot where I hid it more than 10 years ago," Fenn wrote in his announcement.
"I do not know the person who found it, but the poem in my book led him to the precise spot."
The treasure was found a few days ago by a man who did not want to be named, Fenn told the Santa Fe New Mexican .

布什政府对难民入境持敌对态度。”

Abshir's family is one of many families who continue to stay separated, with no date on when refugee admissions to the US will resume, after the coronavirus pandemic halted refugee resettlement around the world.
But refugee admissions to the US had already been on the decline before the virus paralyzed the world.
The nearly four-year uphill battle appeared to be reaching a conclusion when the coronavirus pandemic shut down arrivals.
Abshir, whose husband also lost his job because of the pandemic, has remained hopeful, but extended separations often weigh on families.
This administration is hostile to refugee admissions," she said.

如果您不是种族主义者，那么您就很好，您很好，而且胸怀开阔。

Q: The theme of your book "White Fragility" is how white people are perpetuating racism by being too fragile to discuss the subject openly and honestly.
One of the most important white pillars is what I call the good/bad binary -- you're either racist or you're not.
If you're racist, you're bad.
And if you're not racist, you're good, you're nice and you're open minded.

“红色代表资本主义，这也许就是为什么朝鲜社会不允许您戴它。”
她说，韩国化妆品的价格比朝鲜或中国制造的产品贵两到三倍。
朝鲜的美容行业尽管缺乏国际认可的朝鲜化妆品品牌，但朝鲜的官方媒体KCNA声称其化妆品行业正在蓬勃发展。
Nam办公室展示的朝鲜化妆品与韩国产品的包装相似。
继韩国对服装，化妆和头发的影响之后，人们的日常期望受到破坏，并可能导致人们对朝鲜政权不满和怀疑。

South Korean cosmetics were two to three times more expensive than North Korean or Chinese-made products, she says.
North Korea's beauty industryDespite the absence of internationally-recognized North Korean cosmetics brands, North Korea's state media KCNA claims its cosmetics industry is thriving.

## 宝莱坞为什么在电影中使用冒犯性的进攻手段？

### Why does Bollywood use the offensive practice of brownface in movies?

但它也没有那么讨人喜欢的声誉-促进棕脸的进攻实践。
例如，流行的2019年电影《巴拉》（Bala）讲述了一个女人因肤色而遭受歧视的故事。
宝莱坞明星赫里希克·罗珊（Hrithik Roshan）在2019年宝莱坞电影《超级30》的预告片中的屏幕截图。
演员莎·鲁克·汗（Shah Rukh Khan）经常被称为``宝莱坞之王''，多年来一直为男人们提供一种公平的面霜``公平与英俊''。
Hari认为，宝莱坞（Bollywood）名人可能会做更多的事情，以改变全国各地对深色皮肤的态度。

But it also has a far less flattering reputation -- for promoting the offensive practice of brownface.
For example, the popular 2019 film "Bala" featured the story of a woman who suffered discrimination on the basis of her skin tone.

​Often dubbed the "King of Bollywood," actor Shah Rukh Khan ​endorsed "Fair and Handsome," a fairness cream for men, ​for years.
Hari believes that Bollywood celebrities could be doing much more to change attitudes across the country to dark skin.
