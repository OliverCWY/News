新加坡-Covid-19大流行是人类长期以来所面临的最危险的危机，它将带来巨大挑战，但李显龙总理认为，新加坡可以从中崛起，变得更强大，更好。
国际贸易将受到打击。
李光耀说，新加坡尤其如此，新加坡靠与世界其他地方的联系来谋生。
它与全球贸易，投资，资本和人员流动高度相关，尽管国际贸易和投资可能减少，但它们不会完全消失。
他说：“让我们共同安全地度过这场危机，使新加坡精神在世界上蓬勃发展。”

SINGAPORE - The Covid-19 pandemic is the most dangerous crisis that humanity has faced in a very long time, and it will throw up immense challenges, but Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong believes that an even stronger and better Singapore can emerge from it.
International trade would be hit.
This was especially true of Singapore, which makes a living by connecting itself to the rest of the world, said Mr Lee.
It is highly connected to global flows of trade, investment, capital and people, and while international trade and investments may shrink, they will not disappear entirely.
"Together, let us take Singapore safely through this crisis, and make the Singapore spirit flourish in the world."

SINGAPORE - Tensions between the United States and China have risen during the pandemic, creating a more dangerous world for Singapore, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Sunday (June 7).
Covid-19 has worsened relations with the two global powers taking actions and counter-actions daily, he noted, as he described a challenging global strategic landscape.
It will be a more dangerous world for a small country like Singapore," warned Mr Lee.
"We must ensure our security, and protect and advance our interests when dealing with other countries, big and small," said Mr Lee.
Mr Lee said retrenchments and unemployment will go up, some jobs will disappear for good, and workers will have to learn new skills to stay employed.

伦敦•英国选民决定其国家应离开欧盟的主要原因之一是移民问题。英国人-尤其是那些技术不熟练或富裕的人-显然对开放边界的政策感到厌倦，该政策允许任何欧盟公民在英国定居。
然而上周，英国政府做出了一项重大决定，这可能会引发该国历史上最大的一次移民潮：它宣布，如果他们愿意，最多三百万香港人可以来英国工作，最终永远安定下来。

LONDON • One of the chief reasons why voters in Britain decided that their country should leave the European Union was the question of immigration; Britons - and particularly those less skilled or wealthy - were apparently fed up with the policy of open borders, which allowed any EU citizen to settle in the United Kingdom.
Yet last week, the British government made a momentous decision which could lead to the biggest single wave of immigration in the country's history: It announced that up to three million people from Hong Kong could, if they wish, come to Britain to work and ultimately settle forever.

随着Covid-19大流行和2016年美国总统大选，虚假新闻的威胁重新受到关注。

惠灵顿（彭博）-新西兰在报告Covid-19活跃病例为零之后，将消除对社会隔离的要求，这表明新西兰已经实现了消除病毒的目标。
阿德恩女士在惠灵顿的新闻发布会上说：“我们以前所未有的方式联合起来粉碎了这种病毒。”
新西兰已经采取了明确的消除策略，而不是仅仅抑制病毒的传播。
奥塔哥大学公共卫生专业的迈克尔·贝克教授说，迈向1级“表明我们已经实现了从该国消除Covid-19病毒的目标”。
但是，尚不能得出结论，阿登女士将在9月19日的投票中获得胜利，而失业率预计将在未来几个月内飙升。

WELLINGTON (BLOOMBERG) - New Zealand will remove social distancing requirements after reporting zero active cases of Covid-19, indicating it has achieved its aim of eliminating the virus.
“We united in unprecedented ways to crush the virus,” Ms Ardern said at a press conference in Wellington.
We now have a head-start on our economic recovery.”New Zealand has pursued an explicit elimination strategy rather than seeking to merely suppress transmission of the virus.
Moving to level 1 “is a statement that we have achieved the goal of eliminating the Covid-19 virus from this country”, said Prof Michael Baker, who specialises in public health at the University of Otago.
But it is not a foregone conclusion that Ms Ardern will sweep to victory at the Sept 19 vote, with unemployment expected to soar in coming months.

明尼阿波利斯（法新社法新社）-美国国会议员周日晚（6月7日）表示，在乔治·弗洛伊德（George Floyd）羁押后去世引发全国范围内抗议执法种族主义的抗议活动后，市议员表示，美国明尼阿波利斯市的警察局将被拆除和重建。
市议会的多数票具有否决权，早前曾承诺要“开始拆除警察部队”。
理事会成员Alondra Cano在推文中表示，这项决定是通过“ MPLS市议会的否决权多数”做出的，该议会一致认为警察局“不可改革，我们将结束当前的警务系统”。
班德女士告诉美国有线电视新闻网（CNN），她正在寻求将警察资金转向基于社区的策略，市议会将讨论如何替换现任警察部门。
尽管周六人群众多，但纽约市和美国首都的逮捕人数却有所减少。

MINNEAPOLIS (BLOOMBERG, AFP) - The police department in the US city of Minneapolis will be dismantled and rebuilt, city councilors said late on Sunday (June 7) after the death in custody of Mr George Floyd sparked nationwide protests about racism in law enforcement.
A veto-proof majority of the city council had earlier pledged to "begin the process" of dismantling its police force.
Council member Alondra Cano tweeted that the decision came through “a veto-proof majority of the MPLS City Council”, which agreed that the police department “is not reformable and that we’re going to end the current policing system”.
Ms Bender told CNN she was looking to shift police funding toward community-based strategies, and that the city council would discuss how to replace the current police department.
Despite the crowds' size on Saturday, fewer arrests were reported in New York City and in the nation's capital.

圣保罗（路透社）-卫生部周日（6月7日）的数据表明，巴西政府共记录了37,312例冠状病毒死亡，而该国的整体病例达到685,427例，批评政府处理这一大流行病。
与前一天不同，政府在周日发布了累积数据，而不是过去24小时内的死亡人数和新感染人数。
根据周日的数据，巴西在过去24小时内登记了1,382例新死亡和12,581例新病例。
上周末，由于总统贾尔·博尔索纳罗（Jair Bolsonaro）为世界第二大冠状病毒爆发的正式记录保持时间的延误和变化辩护，该报告已从公众视野中删除了数月的国家流行数据。
上周六，巴西共记录了35,930例冠状病毒死亡和672,846例确诊病例。

SAO PAULO (REUTERS) - Brazil registered 37,312 total coronavirus deaths while overall cases in the country reached 685,427, according to data from the health ministry on Sunday (June 7), amid criticism of the government's handling of the pandemic.
Unlike in the previous day, the government released cumulative figures on Sunday and not a tally of deaths and new infections in the last 24 hours.
Based on Sunday's data, Brazil registered 1,382 new deaths and 12,581 new cases in the last 24 hours.
Over the weekend it removed from public view months of national data on the epidemic as President Jair Bolsonaro defended delays and changes to official record-keeping of the world's second-largest coronavirus outbreak.
On Saturday Brazil registered 35,930 total coronavirus deaths and 672,846 confirmed cases.

华盛顿（法新社）-在数天抗议警察杀死乔治·弗洛伊德的抗议活动之后，美国总统唐纳德·特朗普周日（6月7日）命令国民警卫队从华盛顿街头撤离。

WASHINGTON (AFP) - US President Donald Trump on Sunday (June 7) ordered the withdrawal of National Guard troops from the streets of Washington after days of protests over the police killing of George Floyd.
"I have just given an order for our National Guard to start the process of withdrawing from Washington, DC, now that everything is under perfect control," he tweeted.
Far fewer protesters showed up last night than anticipated\!"
Tens of thousands of people protested peacefully Saturday in many US cities.
In Washington, no significant incidents were reported as protesters took to the streets near the White House, which was surrounded on all sides by fences and security barricades.

吉隆坡-马来西亚将从星期三（6月10日）开始进一步放宽对冠状病毒的限制，几乎所有的社会，经济和宗教活动都将重新开始，同时遵守严格的社会疏远协议和安全措施。
印度总理雅辛周日宣布，政府将允许家庭旅行和小规模的社会活动，并根据“恢复运动控制令”（RMCO）阶段分阶段重新开放学校，该阶段从周三至8月31日。
在严格遵守社会隔离协议的情况下，大多数企业可以在五月重新开业。
但是，学校仍然关闭，同时禁止举行大型社交聚会和州际旅行。
截至4月份，吉隆坡推出了2600亿林吉特（合850亿新元）的刺激计划，以缓解冠状病毒大流行带来的经济打击。

KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysia will further ease its coronavirus restrictions from Wednesday (June 10), with nearly all social, economic and religious activities set to restart while adhering to strict social distancing protocols and safety measures.
Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced on Sunday that the government would allow domestic travel and small-scale social activities, and reopen schools in stages under the "recovery movement control order" (RMCO) phase, which runs from Wednesday until Aug 31.
Most businesses were allowed to reopen in May, with strict social distancing protocols in place.
However, schools remain shut, while large social gatherings and inter-state travel are banned.
Kuala Lumpur had, as at April, rolled out RM260 billion (S$85 billion) in stimulus packages to cushion the economic blow from the coronavirus pandemic.
