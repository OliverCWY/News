The boys’ mission is a sort of superhero pest control – anti-heroism in the precise sense. They go about it in a bumbling, extraordinarily gory, madcap fashion. Eric Kripke, the producer/writer/director, translates the comic books into a nastily satirical universe that is reminiscent of Paul Verhoeven’s films Robocop (1987) and Starship Troopers (1997), two films that throw acid on so many Hollywood pieties that it’s a wonder they got made. Here, life isn’t worth much; characters are suddenly turned into red smears, and the plot races on without a backward glance.

Ultimately, the show asks: what do you do when confronted with people who, for pretty good reasons (money, power, both mostly ill-gotten or accidents of fate) have god complexes? This is a topical question in our current moment of the super-rich and populist leaders, but maybe it has always been high on the human agenda. King Lear complained that we are like flies to the gods. Possibly we have always been flies to someone or other powerful. And what a morbid fascination we bugs have with the beings who squash us.

A story as old as time

No matter where you look geographically, or when you look historically, it seems that people have always been obsessed with heroes and gods. Choose any ancient body of folklore – Beowulf, the Mahabharata, the story of Gilgamesh, the legends of the Monkey King, the Icelandic sagas, the Greek epics, the Bible, Shintoism – and you find intrepid heroes struggling with the aid of, or despite, gods. The hero is often on a quest to accomplish something everyone knows to be humanly impossible, and when he shocks everyone by succeeding, he is rewarded with great wealth, status, maybe even a measure of divinity himself.
