（CNN）总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）喜欢将自己视为一个硬汉。
这可能有助于解释为什么特朗普不喜欢在公共场合戴口罩。
“当我向总统，总理，独裁者，国王，皇后致敬时，戴上口罩-我只是看不到它。”
“我不相信面具，仅此而已，”宾夕法尼亚州集会的特朗普支持者托尼·杰曼（Tony Germaine）周四告诉BuzzFeed。
一言以蔽之，特朗普总统继续对戴口罩的政治化是不可原谅的。

(CNN) President Donald Trump likes to think of himself as a tough guy.
This might help explain why Trump doesn't like to wear a mask in public.
"Wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens -- I just don't see it."
"I don't believe in the mask, that's all," Tony Germaine, a Trump supporter at the Pennsylvania rally on Thursday, told BuzzFeed .
The continued politicization of mask-wearing by President Trump is, in a word, unforgivable.

世卫组织上周的数据显示，在欧洲，所有死亡中几乎有88％是65岁以上的人。
伦敦经济学院的长期护理科维德（LTCcovid）网络显示，全球与Covid-19相关的死亡几乎有一半发生在护理院中。
海尔斯说，牢记老年患者的生活质量，而不仅仅是生存率，这一点很重要。
“灾难性的” LTCcovid上周报告说，在26个国家/地区中，与Covid-19相关的死亡人数平均有47％是养老院居民。
但是霍尔说，在大流行仍在继续的情况下，政府很难大幅改变其对该行业的态度。

WHO figures from last week show that almost 88% of all deaths in Europe were among people aged 65 and over.
And almost half of all deaths linked to Covid-19 globally have taken place in care homes, according to the Long-Term Care Covid (LTCcovid) network at the London School of Economics.
Hailes said it was important to bear in mind elderly patients' quality of life, and not just survival rates.
'Catastrophic'LTCcovid last week reported that on average, across 26 countries, 47% of all Covid-19-linked deaths have been care home residents.
But Hall said it was hard for governments to dramatically change their approach to the sector while the pandemic was still going on.

根据这项研究，中和抗体反应的水平类似于人们从Covid-19自然恢复后的免疫反应。
伦敦卫生与热带医学学院微生物发病机制教授布伦丹·雷恩说：“《柳叶刀》杂志报道的俄罗斯疫苗研究数据令人鼓舞。”
俄罗斯直接投资基金（RDIF）负责人基里尔·德米特里耶夫（Kirill Dmitriev）表示，研究人员已经将疫苗分发给高风险人群，该基金正在为俄罗斯疫苗研究提供资金。
Gamaleya在其Covid-19疫苗中使用腺病毒；这与牛津大学和阿斯利康大学开发的疫苗使用的方法相同。
Bar-Zeev没有参与俄罗斯研究，但同行对其进行了审查。

The levels of neutralizing antibody response were similar to the immune response that people had after naturally recovering from Covid-19, according to the study.
"The data on the Russian vaccine studies reported in The Lancet are encouraging," said Brendan Wren, professor of microbial pathogenesis, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
The researchers are already distributing the vaccine to high-risk groups, according to Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which is financing Russian vaccine research.
Gamaleya is using adenoviruses in their Covid-19 vaccines; this is the same approach used in the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca.
Bar-Zeev was not involved in the Russian study, but peer reviewed it.

亚马尔陨石坑是该地区发现的第一个大洞。
爆炸全部喷出了地冰，在某些情况下，这还留下了孔，巨大的冰冻块落在了表面上。
Bogoyavlensky不相信这些火山口的主要原因是与气候变化有关的温度升高。
同样，纳塔利（Natali）说，她相信气候变化会发挥作用-尽管还需要更多数据来明确说明。
这些漏洞很少，因此可以肯定地说，这很棘手，但是我非常相信气候变化在其中发挥了作用。”

The Yamal Crater was the first of these massive holes to be discovered in the region.
The explosions all ejected ground ice, which in some cases leaves holes where huge frozen blocks have fallen on the surface.
Bogoyavlensky isn't convinced that the primary cause of these craters is warming temperatures linked to climate change.
Likewise, Natali said she believed climate change plays a role -- although more data is needed to say definitively.
There's so few of these holes so it might be tricky to say for certain, but I'm pretty confident climate change is playing a role in this."

来自斯里兰卡和印度的新德里（CNN）消防人员正努力在自周四起一直在燃烧的一艘油轮上扑灭大火，该油轮位于南亚这个岛国的海岸。
斯里兰卡海军说，一名菲律宾机组人员在主机舱内的一台锅炉爆炸后起火死亡。

斯里兰卡空军发布的这张照片显示，新钻石上的大火爆发后，浓烟不断上升。
斯里兰卡海军上校黛西尔瓦（Indika Desilva）在接受美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）采访时说，截至当地时间星期五早上，大火仍在继续。

New Delhi (CNN) Firefighting crews from Sri Lanka and India are working to put out a large blaze aboard an oil tanker that has been burning since Thursday, off the coast of the south Asian island nation.
One Filipino crew member died after a boiler in the main engine room exploded, causing the fire, the Sri Lankan Navy said.
Photos and video showed thick black smoke pouring from one end of the Panamanian-flagged tanker, MT New Diamond, 38 nautical miles (70 kilometers) off Sangamankanda Point in southern Sri Lanka.
This photo released by Sri Lankan Air Force shows smoke rising after the fire broke out on board the New Diamond.
Speaking to CNN, Sri Lankan Navy Captain Indika Desilva said that as of Friday morning local time, the fire was "still on."

"It rattled her, for sure," another White House source tells CNN of Trump's private response to Wolkoff's book.

这位身份不明的乘客正与她的丈夫和孩子一起从乌克兰安塔利亚乘乌克兰国际航空公司的航班飞往乌克兰首都，据闻听到有人说她“太热了”，需要冷静下来。
飞机的机组人员将这名女子召回了里面。
她未经授权在波音737机翼上行走已经被禁止在未来的UIA航班中使用。
根据航空公司的一份声明，机场安全和警察以及医生与现场人员一起确定了该妇女“未受到酒精和/或毒品的影响”。
乌克兰航空公司继续批评该旅客树立了不适当的“父母榜样”，并强调说她可能会受到“罚款的极高罚款”。

The unidentified passenger, who was traveling on a Ukraine International Airlines flight from Antalya, Turkey to the Ukranian capital with her husband and children, was reportedly overheard saying she was "too hot" and needed to cool down.
The woman was summoned back inside by the airplane's crew.
Instagram/boryspilchanyHer unauthorized walk on the wing of the Boeing 737 has seen her banned from all future UIA flights.
According to a statement from the airline, airport security and police attended the scene, along with doctors, who determined the woman "was not under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs."
The Ukraine airline went on to criticize the passenger for setting an inadequate "parental example," stressing that she may be subject to "an exceptionally high financial penalty in the form of a fine."

哥尼利厄斯说，在那顿晚餐中，怀特的一位客人提出了印度种姓歧视的话题。
婆罗门人是印度种姓制的最高阶层，他们传统上是祭司或学者。
印度的宪法禁止种姓歧视，并为边缘化背景的人们制定了平等权利行动计划，从而大大削弱了曾经铁定的分裂，尤其是在城市。
来自边缘种姓的人也报告说在美国的教育机构中面临种姓歧视，并说他们生活在担心种姓“过时”的情况。
进展缓慢，至少有一家美国机构已经采取措施，防止种姓歧视。

During that dinner, the client, who was White, brought up the subject of caste discrimination in India, Cornelius said.
At the top of the Indian caste hierarchy are Brahmins, who were traditionally priests or scholars.
India's constitution outlaws caste discrimination and established affirmative action programs for people from marginalized backgrounds, resulting in significant weakening of once iron-clad divisions, especially in cities.
Those from marginalized castes also reported facing caste discrimination in American educational institutions and said they lived in fear of their caste being "outed."
Slowly, progress is being madeAt least one US institution has already taken steps to protect against caste discrimination.

关于道德时尚和可持续性的广泛误解有时会阻止消费者在生活方式上采取有意义的行动。
误区：从“环保意识”或“可持续”品牌购买商品是减少时尚足迹的最佳方法真相：减少时尚足迹的最佳方法是少买东西。
研究可持续品牌是有帮助的，但是购买新产品应该是最后的选择，而不是第一个选择。
误解：奢侈时尚比快时尚更具可持续性真相：花钱购买奢侈时尚并不能保证可持续性。
麦肯锡（McKinsey）的萨斯基亚·赫德里奇（Saskia Hedrich）告诉美国有线电视新闻网，“评估可持续时尚的客观标准缺失。

Widespread misconceptions about ethical fashion and sustainability can sometimes keep consumers from taking meaningful action when it comes to their lifestyles.
MYTH: Buying from "eco-conscious" or "sustainable" brands is the best way to reduce your fashion footprintTRUTH: The best way to reduce your fashion footprint is to buy fewer things.
Researching sustainable brands is helpful, but buying something new should be the last option, not the first.
MYTH: Luxury fashion is more sustainable than fast fashionTRUTH: Spending money on luxury fashion does not guarantee sustainability.
"Objective criteria for rating sustainable fashion are missing," McKinsey's Saskia Hedrich told CNN.

Big Lots BIG是一家在美国拥有1400多家商店的零售商，近年来销售额停滞不前，但在最近一个季度中，销售额创下了创纪录的增长，赢得了竞争对手的市场份额。
家具是Big Lots最大的业务。
分析师说，这些种类繁多的商品有助于Big Lots与传统的家居装饰和家具销售商以及杂货商区分开。
Big Lots还提供清仓商品，当制造商生产过多的物品或停产生产线时，会从制造商那里获取。
Big Lots商店的平均面积为25,000平方英尺，比典型的超市要小一些。

Big Lots BIG , a retailer with more than 1,400 US stores, saw sales stagnate in recent years but experienced record sales growth during its most recent quarter, gaining market share from rivals.
Furniture is Big Lots' biggest business.
This broad range of items helps Big Lots distinguish itself from traditional home decor and furniture sellers, as well as grocers, analysts say.
Big Lots also offers closeout merchandise, which it scoops up from manufacturers when they produce too much of an item or discontinue a line.
At an average of 25,000 square feet, Big Lots stores are a little smaller than a typical supermarket.

登上匆忙安排的飞机返回达拉斯基地时，科莫开始炖煮一个已经在他脑海中酝酿了多年的想法。
起居室实验室科莫“起居室实验室”的心脏跳动是Gears 3D运动捕捉系统-一套精密的摄像机在房间周围盘旋，记录用户的每一次动作，并生成动作的3D计算机模型。
不仅仅是DeChambeau利用了Como客厅中提供的数据。
科莫客厅的全景。
那么，科莫认为数据和实验室能在多大程度上解开高尔夫挥杆的奥秘呢？

Boarding a hastily arranged flight back to his base in Dallas, Como began to stew on an idea that had been incubating in his mind for years.
Living room laboratoryThe beating heart of Como's "living room lab" is a Gears 3D motion capture system -- a sophisticated set of cameras circling the room which records every movement of the user, and generates a 3D computer model of the action.
It's not just DeChambeau taking advantage of the data on offer in Como's living room.
A general view of Como's living room.
So, how close does Como think the data and the lab can get to unlocking the mystery of the golf swing?

多年来，中国已经超越美国成为全球最大的航空市场。
塞卡托说：“中国商飞C919被设计为“具有中国特色的国际客机”。
它还与中国主要航空公司（如国航和中国东方航空）建立了专门的维护和维修设施。
中国商飞已经建立了由六架C919原型机组成的机队，这些原型机一直在通过飞行测试程序进行调整。
最后，在技术层面上，由于无法预见的故障（开发任何新型客机的一部分），中国商飞C919飞行测试制度和适航性相关认证可能会延迟。

For years, China has been en route to become the world's biggest aviation market, eclipsing the United States.
"The COMAC C919 is designed to be an 'international airliner with Chinese characteristics,'" says Ceccato.
It also has established specialized maintenance and repair facilities with major Chinese airlines such as Air China and China Eastern Airlines.
COMAC has built a fleet of six prototype versions of the C919 that have been pacing through flight testing programs.
Finally, on a technical level, the COMAC C919 flight test regime and associated certification for airworthiness could be delayed due to unforeseen glitches that are part and parcel of developing any new type of airliner.

每个地点都是独一无二的，但斯坦因茨注意到了一个共同的主题-人类正在改变地球。
在2018年《纽约时报》（New York Times）杂志派遣他到各个大洲记录气候变化之后，斯坦梅茨决定整理一本书，收集他整个职业生涯的图像。
“人类星球”记载了我们对环境的影响以及为保护环境而提出的解决方案。
偶然的环保主义者这种鸟瞰世界使Steinmetz能够见证并记录人类改变地球的方式。
这位摄影师说他不打算记录气候变化，但他的工作档案使人类的足迹不可否认。

Each location was unique, but the Steinmetz noticed a common theme -- humans were changing the planet.
After a 2018 New York Times Magazine assignment that sent him to every continent to document climate change, Steinmetz decided to put together a book, collecting images spanning his whole career.
"Human Planet" chronicles our impact on the environment and the solutions we have come up with to try to save it.
The accidental environmentalistThis bird's-eye view of the world allowed Steinmetz to witness -- and document -- the ways humans have changed the planet.
The photographer says he didn't intend to document climate change, but his archive of work made humanity's footprint undeniable.

## 画飞机：为什么每一层都很重要

### Painting an airplane: Why every layer counts

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-通过吸引人的飞机制服吸引公众注意力时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常为白色，但并非总是如此（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板应用了最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，合并和收购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
