伊朗的浓缩铀储量“达到10倍限制”发布时间4小时前相关主题伊朗核交易图片版权EPA图像说明伊朗的低浓缩铀储量远高于2015年核协议中设定的限制伊朗现在的铀储存量是伊朗的10倍多联合国核监督机构说，根据国际协议允许的浓缩铀。
国际原子能机构（IAEA）表示，伊朗浓缩铀储存量已达到2105千克（4640磅），远高于2015年商定的300千克。
在此之前，伊朗向原子能机构视察员提供了进入两个可疑前核电站之一的通道。
这包括生产的浓缩铀数量超过了允许的数量，尽管浓缩水平远远低于原子武器所需的浓缩水平。
全球监管机构在最新的声明中说，伊朗“已向机构检查员提供了进入该地点进行环境采样的通道”。

Iran's enriched uranium stockpile '10 times limit' Published duration 4 hours ago Related Topics Iran nuclear dealimage copyright EPA image caption Iran's stockpile of low-enriched uranium is well above the limit set in a 2015 nuclear agreementIran now has more than 10 times the amount of enriched uranium permitted under an international agreement, the UN's nuclear watchdog says.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Iran's enriched uranium stockpile had reached 2,105kg (4,640lb) - well above the 300kg agreed in 2015.
It comes after Iran gave IAEA inspectors access to one of two suspected former nuclear sites.
This included the production of more enriched uranium than it was allowed - although only at enrichment levels far below that required for use in atomic weapons.
In the latest statement, the global watchdog said Iran had "provided agency inspectors access to the location to take environmental samples".

阿什顿琼脂（Ashton Agar）倒数第二个决赛球用尽，剩下的游客需要从最后六个球中拿出15个。
Marcus Stoinis从Tom Curran的第二回合命中了6分，但最后一球仍需要5分。
早些时候，英格兰曾感激达维德·马兰（Dawid Malan）的66人和乔斯·巴特勒（Jos Buttler）的44人，他们的战绩令人under目结舌的162-7。
即使当芬奇（Finch）击中弓箭手（Archer）跌至46的时候，史密斯（Smith）看起来也很舒服。
澳大利亚队长亚伦·芬奇（Aaron Finch）：“我们知道英格兰会继续努力，我们可能很难在12到18分以上的范围内找到边界。

Ashton Agar was run out off the final ball of the penultimate over, leaving the tourists needing 15 from the final six balls.
Marcus Stoinis hit a six from the second delivery of Tom Curran's over but still needed five from the final ball.
England had earlier been grateful for 66 from Dawid Malan and 44 from Jos Buttler in their underwhelming 162-7.
Even when Finch hit Archer to long-off to fall for 46, Smith looked comfortable.
Australia captain Aaron Finch: "We knew England would keep coming hard and we probably struggled to find the boundary in that 12 to 18-over mark.

它们的特点是脂肪含量高，包括饱和脂肪，单不饱和脂肪酸和多不饱和脂肪酸。
近年来，饱和脂肪含量约为90％的椰子油已成为最新的时尚“超级食品”。
所有的脂肪分子都是由脂肪酸链组成的，这些脂肪酸链通过单键（饱和）或双键（不饱和）结合在一起。
脂肪酸有三种类型：短链，中链和长链。
短链和中链脂肪酸被直接吸收到血液中并用作能量，而长链脂肪酸被运输到肝脏，这会增加血液中的胆固醇水平。

They’re characterised by their high fat content, including saturated fat, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids.
In recent years, coconut oil, which is around 90% saturated fat, has become the latest trendy “superfood”.
All fat molecules are made of chains of fatty acids, which are either held together with single bonds (saturated) or double bonds (unsaturated).
There are three types of fatty acids: short, medium and long chain.
Short and medium chain fatty acids are absorbed directly into the bloodstream and used for energy, but long chain fatty acids are transported to the liver, which raises blood cholesterol levels.

五角大楼官员的命令要求著名军事报纸在9月30日之前停止所有行动。
根据《大西洋》杂志的一篇报道，特朗普先生于2018年取消了对巴黎公墓的访问，因为它“充满了失败者”。
特朗普没有对取消该报纸的计划发表评论。
在那场战争结束之后，它停止了印刷，直到第二次世界大战再次开始，此后一直持续下去。
他们补充说，分配给“星条旗”的1550万美元将对国防部7000亿美元的预算产生“微不足道的影响”。

The order from Pentagon officials calls for the famed military newspaper to cease all operations by 30 September.
According to a report in The Atlantic magazine, Mr Trump cancelled a visit to a US cemetery outside Paris in 2018 because it was "filled with losers".
Mr Trump has not commented on plans to cancel the newspaper.
It ceased printing after that war ended before beginning again in World War Two, and has continued ever since.
They added that the $15.5m allocated to Stars and Stripes would have a "negligible impact" on the Defence Department's $700bn budget.

上个月美国经济增加了更多的工作。由于一些公司开始重新雇用新员工，并且美国人口普查的临时雇用增加了就业人数，美国8月的失业率急剧下降。
自大流行开始以来，企业增加了140万个新工作岗位，失业率首次降至10％以下。
但是，失业率仍然比2月份高得多。
4月份，当美国许多州发布居留令时，失业率达到14.7％的峰值。
“'就业不足'率，包括那些没有寻找但想要工作或更多工作的人，仍然超过14％，下降的速度甚至可能更慢。

Firms added 1.4 million new jobs and unemployment fell below 10% for the first time since the pandemic began.
However, the unemployment rate is still much higher than it was in February.
In April, when many US states issued stay at home orders, the unemployment rate peaked at 14.7%.
"The 'under-employment' rate, which includes those not searching, but wanting to work or work more, still over 14%, may be even slower to fall.
