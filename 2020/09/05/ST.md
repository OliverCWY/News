习近平主席在纪念中国在第二次世界大战中战胜日本周年的活动上发表讲话，概述了中国永远不会接受外国干预的领域。
他特别针对威胁中共继续一党统治的威胁。
习近平说：“中国人民永远不允许任何个人或任何力量将中共与中国人民分开，并使他们相互对抗。”
自第二次世界大战获得控制以来，中国领导人一直强调共产党抵抗外国侵略的能力。
习近平试图加强对国内的控制并面对更加敌对的美国时，他经常转向类似的民族主义主题。

Speaking at an event marking the anniversary of China's victory over Japan in World War II, President Xi outlined areas where China will never accept foreign interference.
He took aim in particular at threats to the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) continued one-party rule.
"The Chinese people will never allow any individual or any force to separate the CCP and Chinese people, and to pitch them against each other," Mr Xi said.
Chinese leaders have stressed the Communist Party's ability to stand up to foreign aggression since they won control after World War II.
As Mr Xi has sought to strengthen his grip at home and confront a more hostile US, he has frequently turned to similar nationalist themes.

他说，根据中国官方新华社发表的评论，许多重大基础设施项目和公共设施将完成，包括川藏铁路。
其中两名消息人士说，川藏铁路最困难的部分（连接成都和拉萨）的建设将在未来几周内开始。
上个月，中国宣布了在未来15年内将其铁路网络扩大三分之一的计划。
两位消息人士说，在西藏地区，计划支出包括公路，道路和风景名胜区的改建和扩建。
在与美国的关系日益恶化的情况下，今年中国对西藏的政策再次受到关注。

He said a number of major infrastructure projects and public facilities would be completed, including the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, according to remarks published by China's official Xinhua news agency.
Construction on the most difficult section of the Sichuan-Tibet railway - linking Chengdu with Lhasa - will begin in coming weeks, said two of the sources.
Last month, China announced plans to expand the country's railway network by one-third over the next 15 years.
Within Tibet, the planned spending covers the revamp and expansion of highways, roads and scenic spots, two of the sources said.
China's policies towards Tibet have come under the spotlight again this year amid worsening ties with the United States.

莫斯科（路透社）-根据《柳叶刀》医学杂志周五（9月4日）发表的结果，俄罗斯的“ Sputnik-V” Covid-19疫苗在早期试验的所有参与者中产生了抗体应答，莫斯科称其为“回应批评者。
《柳叶刀》说：“两项为期42天的试验-每个试验包括38名健康成年人-并未在参与者中发现任何严重的不良反应，并证实了候选疫苗引起了抗体反应。”
没有参与这项研究的巴尔·泽夫博士说：“尚未显示任何Covid-19疫苗的临床疗效。”
《柳叶刀》杂志说，早期试验表明，Sputnik-V疫苗在免疫系统的一个称为T细胞的成分中产生了应答。
俄罗斯已经表示，预计到今年年底，每月将生产150万至200万剂潜在的Covid-19疫苗，并将逐步将产量提高至每月600万剂。

MOSCOW (REUTERS) - Russia's "Sputnik-V" Covid-19 vaccine produced an antibody response in all participants in early-stage trials, according to results published on Friday (Sept 4) by The Lancet medical journal that were hailed by Moscow as an answer to its critics.
"The two 42-day trials - including 38 healthy adults each - did not find any serious adverse effects among participants, and confirmed that the vaccine candidates elicit an antibody response," The Lancet said.
Dr Bar-Zeev, who was not involved in the study, said "clinical efficacy for any Covid-19 vaccine has not yet been shown."
The Lancet said the early-stage trials suggested the Sputnik-V vaccine produced a response in a component of the immune system known as T cells.
Russia has said it expects to produce between 1.5 million and 2 million doses per month of its potential Covid-19 vaccine by the end of the year, gradually increasing production to 6 million doses a month.

堪培拉（彭博社）-澳大利亚总理莫里森表示，大多数州和领地领导人已承诺在12月之前开放经济，但未能立即达成协议，以解除破坏经济复苏的边境限制。
这使引导经济摆脱近30年来的首次衰退的努力变得更加复杂。
在八位州和领地领导人中，有七位再次承诺在圣诞节之前开放经济，这最初是在7月底之前设想的。
西澳州是该州资源产业的重镇，是坚持的条件。
莫里森对记者说：“在没有疫苗的情况下，我们可能不得不这样生活数年。”

CANBERRA (BLOOMBERG) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said most state and territory leaders have recommitted to opening up the economy by December, but failed to secure an immediate agreement to lift border restrictions that are crippling the economic recovery.
That's complicating efforts to steer the economy out of its first recession in almost 30 years.
Seven out of the eight state and territory leaders recommitted to open up the economy by Christmas, something that was originally envisaged by the end of July.
The state of Western Australia, the powerhouse of the nation's resources industry, was the holdout.
"In the absence of a vaccine, we may have to live this way for years," Mr Morrison told reporters.

一些受训者誓言将继续罢工，增加约16,000名实习生和驻地医生，以反对政府采取的措施，例如增加医生人数和建立公立医学院等。
韩国医学会（KMA）高级官员林贤泽（Lim Hyun-taek）说，他已对签署该协议的韩国总统崔大治（Choi Dae-zip）提出不信任动议，理由是他未与成员进行充分磋商。
致电该协会征求意见的电话没有得到答复，但崔刚表示他的决定不是单方面的。
崔在与卫生部长朴能厚签署协议终止罢工后，敦促受训人员重返工作岗位。
崔在声明中说：“改善罢工条件和建​​立合理的医疗体系的共同目标不能仅靠罢工来实现。”

Some of the trainees vowed to continue the walkout by about 16,000 interns and resident doctors to oppose the government measures, such as increasing the number of doctors and building public medical schools, among others.
Lim Hyun-taek, a senior official of the Korean Medical Association (KMA), said he had filed a non-confidence motion against its president, Choi Dae-zip, who signed the pact, for not holding sufficient consultations with members.
Telephone calls to the association to seek comment went unanswered, but earlier Choi said his decision was not unilateral.
Choi had urged the trainees to return to work after he signed the deal with Health Minister Park Neung-hoo to end the strike.
“Our shared goals of improving work conditions and building a reasonable medical system cannot be achieved by a strike alone,” Choi said in a statement.

东京（路透社）-世界上最大的日本金枪鱼市场受到冠状病毒大流行的巨大打击，迫使东京庞大的丰洲鱼市场的餐馆和批发商适应生存。
随着大流行消灭了活动的订单，对新鲜鱼，特别是所谓的“寿司之王”蓝鳍金枪鱼的需求下降。
2018年，全球金枪鱼进口总值为157亿美元（214亿新元），而日本是当年最大的金枪鱼进口国。
但日本经济省的数据显示，大流行对该行业造成了沉重打击，日本的金枪鱼进口在2020年的前六个月比去年同期下降了18％。
东京海洋科学技术大学副教授Toshio Katsukawa博士说，东京的寿司店在其他地区的人们中往往很受欢迎，而从首都以外来的游客却越来越少。

TOKYO (REUTERS) - Japan's tuna market, the world's largest, is taking an outsized hit from the coronavirus pandemic, pressuring restaurants and wholesalers at Tokyo's sprawling Toyosu fish market to adapt to survive.
Demand for fresh fish, especially the so-called "king of sushi" bluefin tuna, has slumped as the pandemic wiped out orders for events.
In 2018, global imports of tuna were valued at US$15.7 billion (S$21.4 billion), while Japan was the biggest tuna importer that year.
But the pandemic has hit the industry hard and Japan's tuna imports fell 18 per cent in the first six months of 2020 from a year earlier, finance ministry data showed.
Tokyo's sushi restaurants, which tend to be popular among people from other regions, are getting fewer visitors from outside the capital, said Dr Toshio Katsukawa, associate professor at the Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology.

吉隆坡-马来西亚总理穆希丁·亚辛（Muhyiddin Yassin）表示，他希望尽快完成允许工人恢复在马来西亚和新加坡之间日常通勤的程序。
9月3日，这是在新加坡高级专员马来西亚大公Vanu Gopala Menon先生在他在布城的办公室的Tan Sri Muhyiddin的礼节性电话中讨论的一些问题。
其中约有100,000名马来西亚人每天往返新加坡和马来西亚之间。
Muhyiddin先生说，他们还谈到了自8月17日起在新加坡与马来西亚边境实施互惠绿色通道（RGL）和定期通勤安排（PCA）的问题。
Muhyiddin先生说：“我们相信这些措施将有助于马来西亚和新加坡逐步恢复经济，以及受Covid-19大流行影响的人们之间的互动。”

KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin has expressed his hope that procedures for allowing workers to resume commuting daily between Malaysia and Singapore can be finalised soon.
This was among some of the issues discussed during a courtesy call by Singapore's High Commissioner to Malaysia, Mr Vanu Gopala Menon, on Tan Sri Muhyiddin at his office in Putrajaya on Thursday (Sept 3).
Among them were about 100,000 Malaysians who commuted daily between Singapore and Malaysia.
Mr Muhyiddin said they had also talked about the implementation of the Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL) and Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) at the Singapore-Malaysia border, which started on Aug 17.
"We are confident that the measures would help Malaysia and Singapore to gradually restore their economies and the interaction of the people affected by the Covid-19 pandemic," said Mr Muhyiddin.

虽然该部门没有披露管理资产（AUM），但它是星展集团2510亿美元财富平台的一部分，该平台是亚洲最大的财富平台之一。
这是一个非常有趣的现象。”
潘先生表示，星展银行预计今年的资产管理规模将以类似的速度增长。
在该地区的其他地方，星展集团有望在2023年之前将其泰国经纪业务的财富资产增加一倍，达到80亿美元。
星展银行私人银行业务负责人潘文said表示，这家私人银行是星展银行更广泛的财富平台的一部分，截至6月底，星展银行的资产较上年同期增长了7％。

While the unit doesn't disclose assets under management (AUM), it's part of DBS' $251 billion wider wealth platform, which is among the largest in Asia.
It's a very interesting phenomenon," said Mr Poon.
DBS expects AUM to grow at a similar rate this year, Mr Poon said.
Elsewhere in the region, DBS is on track to double the wealth assets at its Thai brokerage unit to $8 billion by 2023.
Group Head of DBS Private Bank Joseph Poon said the private bank is part of DBS' wider wealth platform whose assets grew 7 per cent at the end of June from a year earlier.

新加坡-缩编的Axington Inc.董事会表示，拟议的配股将按计划进行，尽管在围绕Bellagraph Nova（BN）集团的争议中，五名董事辞职，该集团由Axington的控股股东和前董事长创立。
他们补充说，一旦更加清楚，董事会将评估对提议的决议案和推迟的临时股东大会（EGM）的影响和变化。
关于供股，他们表示，8月21日宣布的关键事件的时间表没有任何修改，董事会“打算按照时间表进行供股”。
在前美国驻新加坡大使柯克·瓦格（Kirk Wagar）辞职一周后，沉女士于周二辞去了阿克星顿董事长的职务，并与其他三名董事一起辞职。
除其他事项外，供股时间表规定，接受和支付供股的最后一天将是9月9日，预计发行的日期将是9月16日，预计它们将在9月17日开始交易。

SINGAPORE - The much-reduced board of Axington Inc said a proposed rights issue will proceed as planned, despite five directors quitting amid the controversy surrounding the Bellagraph Nova (BN) Group, a company founded by Axington's controlling shareholders and former chairman.
Once it has more clarity, the board will assess the impact and changes, if any, on the proposed resolutions and the postponed extraordinary general meeting (EGM), they added.
On the rights issue, they said there have not been any modifications to the timetable of key events as announced on Aug 21, and the board "intends for the rights issue to proceed as per the timetable".
Ms Shen resigned on Tuesday as Axington's chairman, along with three other directors, a week after former US ambassador to Singapore Kirk Wagar quit from the board.
Among other things, the timetable for the rights issue states that the last day for acceptance and payment for rights shares would be Sept 9, that the expected date for their issuance would be Sept 16 and they were expected to begin trading on Sept 17.

马来西亚已经撤销对高盛集团部门的刑事指控，这是39亿美元（合53亿新元）和解协议中的关键一步，该协议使该银行摆脱了1MDB丑闻。
该银行的和解协议不会影响马来西亚对其他人的债权，包括丑闻的涉嫌策划人Low Taek Jho（也称为Jho Low）以及其他各方。
检察官试图将前美国高盛银行家罗杰·伍（Roger Ng）带到马来西亚，以面对类似的指控。罗格·伍在美国面临与1MDB相关的指控。
高盛向马来西亚支付34亿美元作为1MDB和解协议的一部分Ng的下一次提起诉讼案定于9月10日。
纳吉（Najib）上个月被判犯有腐败罪，并在丑闻的第一次审判中被判处12年徒刑，而Jho Low仍然逍遥法外。

KUALA LUMPUR (BLOOMBERG) - Malaysia has dropped criminal charges against Goldman Sachs Group units, a key step in the US$3.9 billion (S$5.3 billion) settlement agreement that allows the bank to move on from the 1MDB scandal.
The bank's settlement does not affect Malaysia's claims against other people, including the scandal's alleged mastermind Low Taek Jho, also known as Jho Low, and other parties.
Prosecutors seek to bring former Goldman Sachs banker Roger Ng, who is in the US to face 1MDB-related charges, back to Malaysia in November to face similar accusations.
Related Story Goldman pays Malaysia $3.4 billion as part of 1MDB settlementNg's next case mention is set for Sept 10.
Najib was found guilty of corruption last month and sentenced to 12 years in prison in the first trial over the scandal, while Jho Low remains at large.

新西兰卫生部说，上周五，一名五十多岁的男子死于奥克兰一家医院，死于Covid-19。
他的死亡是该国三个多月来首例死亡，使该国与Covid-19相关的死亡人数达到23。
5月24日报道了新西兰最后一次与Covid-19相关的死亡。

封锁大部分是在周日解除的，允许学校和办公室重新开放，尽管全国各地的公共交通都必须戴口罩。

New Zealand’s health ministry said a man in his 50s had died in an Auckland hospital on Friday due to Covid-19.
His death, the first in the country in more than three months, takes the number of Covid-19 related fatalities in the country to 23.
The last Covid-19-related death in New Zealand was reported on May 24.
The ministry also reported five new Covid-19 cases on Friday - three cases of community transmission and two imported cases at managed isolation facilities.
The lockdown was mostly lifted on Sunday, allowing schools and offices to reopen, although masks are mandatory on public transport across the country.

什么时候旅行限制可能会进一步放宽，以及是否会对学生人数和国际学校预算产生持久影响，还有待观察。

As many as 40 per cent of teachers and students due to start the term this month remain abroad, according to the Association of China and Mongolia International Schools which represents 58 schools catering to mostly foreign nationals.
When travel restrictions might ease further and whether there will be a lasting impact on student numbers and international school budgets also remains to be seen.
Chinese-run schools employing foreign teachers are facing similar difficulties.
