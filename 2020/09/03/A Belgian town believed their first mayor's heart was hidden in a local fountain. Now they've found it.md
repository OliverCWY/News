(CNN) Locals in a Belgian city have believed for over a century that the heart of their first mayor was hidden within a public fountain.

And now, the legend has been proven true -- after officials discovered the organ while carrying out renovations.

The heart of Pierre David, the first mayor of Verviers, was discovered locked in a small casket within the fountain in August, city officials have said.

David ran Verviers from 1798 until his death in 1839. In the 1880s officials decided to move his heart from the town hall, where it had been kept, and instead place it in a box within a fountain in the city's center, CNN affiliate RTL reported.

The box has not been opened but is inscribed with David's name.
