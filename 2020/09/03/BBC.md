阿列克谢·纳瓦尔尼（Alexei Navalny）：俄罗斯反对派领袖被诺维奇克毒死-德国发布时间2小时前图片版权Reuters德国有“明确的证据”表明俄罗斯反对派政客阿列克谢·纳瓦尔尼被诺维奇克神经毒剂中毒。
纳瓦尼上个月在西伯利亚的一次航班上生病后因病飞往了柏林，目前仍处于昏迷状态。
Novichok神经毒剂于2018年被用来毒害前俄罗斯间谍Sergei Skripal和他的女儿在英国。
“有人试图让[纳瓦尔尼先生]保持沉默，我以整个德国政府的名义最强烈地谴责这一点。”
但是，由于定罪，他被禁止在普选中反对普京。

Alexei Navalny: Russia opposition leader poisoned with Novichok - Germany Published duration 2 hours agoimage copyright ReutersThere is "unequivocal proof" that Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent, Germany has said.
Mr Navalny was flown to Berlin after falling ill on a flight in Siberia last month, and remains in a coma.
A Novichok nerve agent was used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the UK in 2018.
"Someone tried to silence [Mr Navalny] and in the name of the whole German government I condemn that in the strongest terms."
However, he has been banned from standing against Mr Putin in elections because of a conviction for embezzlement.

她在推特上说，庞培的举动标志着“美国制裁的惊人改变，旨在制裁侵犯权利的人和盗窃者，以那些起诉战争罪的人为目标。”
ICC今年年初开始调查美国和其他国家在阿富汗冲突中所犯的战争罪。

The ICC began investigating alleged war crimes committed by the US and others in the Afghan conflict earlier this year.
Afghanistan is a member of the court but officials there have also expressed opposition to the inquiry.

不过，俄罗斯核工业的安全性和透明度经常受到质疑，最近一次是荷兰当局得出结论认为，6月在北欧发现的放射性碘131起源于俄罗斯西部。
Mayak的后处理设施通过火车从安德烈耶夫湾接收乏燃料，其历史可追溯到1957年世界最严重的核灾难。
尽管需要提高K-159和K-27，俄罗斯绿色和平组织的拉希德·阿里莫夫（Rashid Alimov）有所保留。
他说：“我们担心监测这项工作，公众参与以及[乏燃料]向玛雅克的运输，”。
最后，他们只设法将三分之一的潜艇浮出水面，使中央情报局几乎没有可用的情报。

The safety and transparency of Russia’s nuclear industry has often been questioned, though, most recently when Dutch authorities concluded that radioactive iodine-131 detected over northern Europe in June originated in western Russia.
The Mayak reprocessing facility that received the spent fuel from Andreyev Bay by train has a troubled history going back to the world’s then-worst nuclear disaster in 1957.
While the K-159 and K-27 need to be raised, Rashid Alimov of Greenpeace Russia has reservations.
“We are worried about the monitoring of this work, public participation and the transport [of spent fuel] to Mayak,” he says.
In the end, they only managed to bring a third of the submarine to the surface, leaving the CIA with little usable intelligence.

西班牙独裁者佛朗哥的家人告诉交出颐和园发布时间8小时前图片版权Getty Images图片标题该案在加利西亚被受理，原因是佛朗哥的家人将房产出售。西班牙西北部法院宣布西班牙已故独裁者弗朗西斯科·佛朗哥（Francisco Franco）使用的颐和园属于国家，他的家人应将其移交给国家。
它始建于1893年至1907年，最初是西班牙作家艾米利亚·帕多·巴赞（Emilia PardoBazán）的家族所有。
尽管政府得到了地方和地区政府的支持，但佛朗哥的六个孙子认为1941年的拍卖是有效的。
他的孙子弗朗西斯·佛朗哥（Francis Franco）指责政府试图对弗朗哥（Franco）家族进行“报复”，因为他不支持已故独裁者遗体的争端。
西班牙国王胡安·卡洛斯（Juan Carlos）于1975年在腐败丑闻中帮助指导西班牙走向民主，并于2014年退位。

Spanish dictator Franco's family told to hand back summer palace Published duration 8 hours agoimage copyright Getty Images image caption The case was taken up in Galicia when it emerged that Franco's family had put the property up for saleA court in north-western Spain has declared that a summer palace used by late Spanish dictator Francisco Franco belongs to the state and his family should hand it over.
Built between 1893 and 1907 it was originally owned by the family of Spanish writer Emilia Pardo Bazán.
Although the government was backed by local and regional authorities, Franco's six grandchildren argued that the 1941 sale was valid.
His grandson Francis Franco accused the government of trying to "retaliate" against the Franco family for not backing down over the dispute over the late dictator's remains.
Juan Carlos, the Spanish king who helped guide Spain to democracy in 1975 abdicated in 2014 amid a corruption scandal.

大流行期间，数百家商店关门，但乐高并未关门。乐高今年有望开设120家新店。
这家丹麦玩具公司告诉BBC实体店的前途一片光明，尽管大街上的人流减少了，商店的社交距离也有所减少。
老板尼尔斯·克里斯蒂安森（Niels Christiansen）说：“当我们的商店在封锁后重新开业时，已经排起了长队。”
这家玩具公司宣布，今年上半年的收入为157亿丹麦克朗（合18亿英镑），增长7％，而营业利润增长了11％。

"When our stores have reopened after lockdown, there have been queues," boss Niels Christiansen said.
It comes as the toy firm announced revenues of DKK 15.7bn (£1.8bn) for the first half of the year, up 7%, while operating profit grew by 11%.
"We saw a very positive development during the coronavirus lockdown when families began playing and building Lego sets together."

由于遭受冠状病毒的经济影响，澳大利亚经济近30年来首次陷入衰退。
在2008年全球金融危机期间，澳大利亚是唯一避免衰退的主要经济体-主要是由于中国对其自然资源的需求。
由于家庭在商品和服务上的支出严重收缩，这是61年来最差的经济增长。
从技术上讲，这是澳大利亚在这一年里失去了著名的“幸运国家”的绰号，并在近三十年来首次陷入衰退的一年。
几十年来，澳大利亚经济一直稳定增长，其中煤炭，铁矿石和天然气向强劲的中国出口强劲。

Australia was the only major economy to avoid a recession during the 2008 global financial crisis - mainly due to demand from China for its natural resources.
This is the worst economic growth in 61 years due to a severe contraction in household spending on goods and services.
It's the year Australia technically lost its famous nickname as 'The Lucky Country' and fell into recession for the first time in almost three decades.
Australia has had a steady economy growth for decades with strong coal, iron ore and natural gas exports to a surging China.
