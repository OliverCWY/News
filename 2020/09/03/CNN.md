（CNN）南希·佩洛西（Nancy Pelosi）是民主党中最聪明的政治策略家之一。
这就是为什么她决定在旧金山的一家商店里在室内做头发的决定意义不大的原因。
在福克斯新闻（Fox News）获得的安全录像中，佩洛西（Pelosi）没戴面具就被展示在沙龙内。
（安全录像显示佩洛西的头发似乎很湿。）
问题是佩洛西被告知错误。

(CNN) Nancy Pelosi is one of the -- if not the -- smartest political strategists in the Democratic Party.
Which is why her decision to have her hair done indoors at a shop in San Francisco makes so little sense.
In security footage obtained by Fox News, Pelosi is shown inside the salon without a mask.
(The security footage shows Pelosi with what appears to be wet hair.)
The problem is that Pelosi was told wrong.

（CNN）美国疾病预防控制中心已通知美国各地的公共卫生官员，准备尽快于10月下旬分发潜在的冠状病毒疫苗。
它还提供了计划方案，以帮助各州做好准备。
这些文件是由《纽约时报》发布的，并且CDC向CNN确认已经将它们发送给了市和州的公共卫生官员。
当供应“可能受到限制”时，这些方案提供了有关两种Covid-19疫苗分配的详细信息。
这些文件对疫苗的特定人群进行了优先排序，包括医疗保健专业人员，基本工人，长期护理机构的居民以及工作人员和国家安全人员。

(CNN) The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has told public health officials around the United States to prepare to distribute a potential coronavirus vaccine as soon as late October.
It also provided planning scenarios to help states prepare.
The documents were posted by The New York Times and the CDC confirmed to CNN it has sent them to city and state public health officials.
The scenarios offer details about distribution for two Covid-19 vaccines when supplies "may be constrained."
The documents prioritize particular populations for the vaccines, including health care professionals, essential workers, long-term care facility residents and staff and national security populations.

（CNN）泰勒·佩里（Tyler Perry）喜欢人们有时解释他的成功的方式。
他最近对《福布斯》表示：“当人们说你来自'卑鄙的开端'时，我爱。”
“ [这]意味着你穷得要命。”
佩里在新奥尔良长大，在高中毕业后就辍学了。
这些戏剧使他成为了明星，并开始了他的职业生涯，最终使他成为媒体大亨和第一个独立拥有工作室的非洲裔美国人。

(CNN) Tyler Perry enjoys how people sometimes explain his success.
"I love when people say you come from 'humble beginnings,' " he recently told Forbes.
"[It] means you were poor as hell."
Raised in poverty in New Orleans, Perry dropped out of high school and went through a period of homelessness as he struggled as a playwright.
Those plays turned him into a star and launched a career that would eventually lead him to become a media mogul and first African American to independently own a studio.

离开迪拜的几天后，这位66岁的人权活动家在卢旺达浮出水面，戴着手铐游行，面临与恐怖相关的指控。
但是，阿联酋官员证实，海湾国家和卢旺达之间没有达成引渡罪犯或通缉犯的协议。
家人被绑架的恐惧Rusesabagina的家人告诉CNN，他们认为他被绑架了，但没有任何证据。
一家人告诉美国有线电视新闻网，当天晚上某个时候，鲁塞萨巴吉纳（Rusesabagina）与妻子和女儿通过电话办理了入住手续。
在由胡图族极端分子领导的卢旺达种族大屠杀中，约有80万图西族和温和的胡图族被杀。

Days after his departure from Dubai, the 66-year-old human rights activist surfaced in Rwanda, paraded in handcuffs, facing terror related charges.
However, the UAE official confirmed that there is no agreement between the Gulf state and Rwanda to extradite criminals or wanted people.
Family kidnap fearsRusesabagina's family told CNN that they believe he was kidnapped, but have no proof of this.
Sometime that same evening Rusesabagina checked in by phone with his wife and daughter, the family told CNN.
Around 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed in the Rwandan genocide, which was led by Hutu extremists.

（CNN）比利时城市的当地人相信一个多世纪以来，他们的第一任市长的心脏一直隐藏在公共喷泉中。
如今，这个传说已被证明是正确的-官员在进行翻修时发现了这种器官。
市政官员说，八月，韦尔维耶的第一任市长皮埃尔·大卫的心脏被发现被锁在喷泉内的一个小棺材里。
据美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）的附属机构RTL报道，在1880年代，官员们决定将他的心脏从曾经保存过的市政厅移开，而是将其放在城市中心喷泉中的盒子中。
该盒子尚未打开，但上面刻有大卫的名字。

(CNN) Locals in a Belgian city have believed for over a century that the heart of their first mayor was hidden within a public fountain.
And now, the legend has been proven true -- after officials discovered the organ while carrying out renovations.
The heart of Pierre David, the first mayor of Verviers, was discovered locked in a small casket within the fountain in August, city officials have said.
In the 1880s officials decided to move his heart from the town hall, where it had been kept, and instead place it in a box within a fountain in the city's center, CNN affiliate RTL reported.
The box has not been opened but is inscribed with David's name.

"Every single stunt that I've ever done is about endurance and pushing past what I thought would be possible," Blaine said in a video before the performance .
He began his ascent on Wednesday morning, and the performance took about an hour from lift off to landing.

而且，如果您是一个关心您对地球的影响并希望购买更具可持续性的时尚的大码人，那么您的选择余地会进一步减少。

致力于实现更可持续发展实践的时装品牌和零售商必须找到真正具有包容性的空间-这也意味着包括大码服装。

But despite these promising developments, we are still a long way out from a truly inclusive fashion industry.
And if you're a plus-size person who cares about your impact on the planet and wants to shop for more sustainable fashion, your pool of options shrinks even further.
So, if we apply the idea of allyship to the sustainable fashion movement, then we shouldn't pick and choose, or exclude a significant part of the population.
5 ways you can change your fashion habits to help the planetThe ethical and sustainable fashion movement is still taking shape, and in this nascent trend there is a chance to make the fashion industry more responsible and more responsive to consumers' realities.
Fashion brands and retailers working towards more sustainable practices must find room to be truly inclusive -- and that means including plus-size bodies, too.

如今，我们许多人购买新衣服的次数过多，而对我们已经拥有的衣物的保存时间不够久。
2017年，环境保护署报告称，美国有1,120万吨纺织废料最终被填埋。
因此，在首次穿上衣服时扔掉衣服之前，请考虑如何延长衣柜的使用寿命。
如果您洒了茶或咖啡，请将衣物浸入水和醋中。
升级和重新使用有时，衣服无法保存为当前形式，但可以在壁橱中重生。

Today, many of us are buying new clothes too often, and not holding on to what we already own for long enough.
In 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency reported that 11.2 million tons of textile waste in the US ended up in landfills.
So before throwing out a garment at the first sign of wear, consider how you can extend your wardrobe's lifespan.
If you spilled your tea or coffee, soak the garment in water and vinegar.
Upcycling and repurposingSometimes a garment can't be saved in its current form, but it can have a second life in your closet.

华盛顿（CNN商业）在航空旅行没有反弹或看不到新的联邦帮助的情况下，联合航空表示将在不到一个月的时间里解散约20％的一线员工。
UAL在给员工的新备忘录中说，当联邦救助计划的工资限制于10月1日到期时，将解雇16,370名员工。
美国联合航空公司的高管周三对记者说，这一数字不到该航空公司7月份休假预测的一半，部分原因是有7,400名员工接受了提前退休或自愿离职，还有一个未指定的休无薪假的人数。
曼联的备忘录称休假是“令人心痛的”最后手段，但该航空公司“无法继续大幅超过我们的飞行计划的人员配备”。
备忘录中写道：“很显然，延长延期将是一件事，它将防止在10月1日发生非自愿休假，并希望将对员工的任何潜在影响推迟到2021年初。”

Washington (CNN Business) With no air travel rebound or new federal help in sight, United Airlines says it will furlough about 20% of its frontline employees in less than a month's time.
United UAL In a new memo to its employees,says that 16,370 employees will be furloughed when payroll restrictions attached to a federal bailout expire October 1.
United executives told reporters on Wednesday that the number is less than half of the airline's July furlough forecast , thanks in part to 7,400 employees accepting early retirements or voluntary departures, and an unspecified number taking unpaid leave.
United's memo calls furloughs a "heart-wrenching" last resort, but the airline "cannot continue with staffing levels that significantly exceed the schedule we fly."
"To be clear, an extension would be the one thing that would prevent involuntary furloughs on October 1 and hopefully delay any potential impact on employees until early 2021," reads the memo.

“人类星球”记载了我们对环境的影响以及为保护环境而提出的解决方案。

Each location was unique, but the Steinmetz noticed a common theme -- humans were changing the planet.
After a 2018 New York Times Magazine assignment that sent him to every continent to document climate change, Steinmetz decided to put together a book, collecting images spanning his whole career.
"Human Planet" chronicles our impact on the environment and the solutions we have come up with to try to save it.

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-通过吸引人的飞机制服吸引公众注意力时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常为白色，但并非总是如此（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板应用了最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，合并和收购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
