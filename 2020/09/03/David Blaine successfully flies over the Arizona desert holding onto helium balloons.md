(CNN) David Blaine just managed to do what so many can only dream of -- flying up into the air using a bunch of balloons.

The illusionist floated over the Arizona desert on Wednesday by holding onto about 50 helium balloons.

"Every single stunt that I've ever done is about endurance and pushing past what I thought would be possible," Blaine said in a video before the performance . "I can't imagine that many people would dream of doing it."
