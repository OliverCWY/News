人数下降证明执政党领导人争取早日进行民意调查是合理的，因为他们试图利用政府处理Covid-19的积极情绪。
大多数马来西亚人唯一满意的联盟是PN，其中51％的人表示对协议感到满意。
国阵的幸福感和不满感分别为40％和MN的37％。
然而，对于前总理纳吉布·拉扎克（Najib Razak）来说，这是一个坏消息，他在部分马来支持者中仍然很受欢迎。
纳吉（Najib）正在对判决提出上诉，这将使他无法参加下届选举。

The dip in numbers justify ruling party leaders’ push for early polls, as they seek to capitalise on positive sentiment over the government’s handling of Covid-19.
The only coalition that the majority of Malaysians are satisfied with is PN, with 51 per cent saying they are happy with the pact.
Happiness and dissatisfaction levels for BN are both at 40 per cent and similarly at 37 per cent for MN.
However, there is bad news for former premier Najib Razak, who remains popular among a segment of Malay supporters.
Najib is appealing the verdict, which would rule him out from contesting the next election.

他说，即使新加坡在调整工作准证政策时，也必须谨慎，不要发出错误的信号，即不再欢迎他人。
他指出，自从Covid-19以来，就业准证和S准证持有者的数量有所减少，并且工作准证计划仍在不断调整。
最终，我们的目标是发展经济，为新加坡人创造良好的就业机会，并提高我们的生活水平。”
“因此，即使我们调整了工作准证政策，我们也必须小心，不要给人以错误的印象，即我们正在关闭，不再欢迎外国人。
我们将调整政策以维护新加坡人的工作，但让我们对新加坡人能够在世界上拥有自己的地位充满信心。”

And even as Singapore adjusts its policies on work passes, it must be careful not to send the wrong signal that it is no longer welcoming to others, he said.
He noted that the numbers of Employment Pass and S Pass holders have come down since Covid-19, and work pass schemes continue to be adjusted.
Ultimately, our aim is to grow our economy, create good jobs for Singaporeans and raise our standards of living," he said.
"So even as we adjust our work pass policies, we must be careful not to give the wrong impression that we are now closing up, and no longer welcoming foreigners.
We will adjust our policies to safeguard Singaporean jobs, but let us show confidence that Singaporeans can hold our own in the world."

特朗普先生还承诺投入数百万美元来重振这座城市。
民主党州长托尼·埃弗斯（Tony Evers）曾建议特朗普不要访问，并表示这将加剧紧张局势。
威斯康星州拥有10个最重要的选举学院票，是一个摇摆不定的州，特朗普在2016年以不到25,000票的优势赢得了选举。
所有这些问题都是民主党的城市，”特朗普总统说，指的是动摇了几个城市的动乱。
在周一的新闻发布会上，特朗普总统被问到是否会谴责这名17岁的少年时，似乎为他辩护，暗示他一直在自卫，这是射手律师的论点。

Mr Trump also pledged several million dollars to revive the city.
Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat, had advised Mr Trump not to visit, saying it would exacerbate tensions.
Wisconsin, with 10 all-important Electoral College votes, is a swing state, which Mr Trump won in 2016 by fewer than 25,000 votes.
All these problems are Democrat cities,” President Trump said, referring to the unrest that has roiled several cities.
At a press briefing on Monday, President Trump, when asked whether he would condemn the 17-year-old, seemed to defend him, suggesting that he had been acting in self-defence – which is the shooter’s lawyer’s argument.

曼谷（路透社/亚洲/亚洲新闻网）-宫殿于8月29日在皇家宪报上宣布，泰国国王玛哈·瓦吉拉隆功（Mah Vajiralongkorn）已将Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi女士恢复为王室贵族配偶，并退还了她的王室徽章和军衔。
8月29日在皇家公报上发表的声明说，Sineenat女士“未受污染”，因此有权获得皇家贵族的头衔以及她在宫殿中的所有先前职位。
Bild报纸本周报道说她已经到达德国，泰国国王一年中大部分时间都在德国度过。

台北-台湾星期三（9月2日）揭开了台湾新护照的封面，扩大了拼写“台湾”的字母，并将“中华民国”的名称缩小到几乎看不见的字样，从而将旅行证件与中国护照区分开了。
台湾外交部表示，虽然台湾的正式名称是中华民国（ROC），但其主意是要更多地注意“台湾”一词。
台湾总统蔡英文说：“新护照更加容易识别，并强调台湾元素。
吴邦国说，外交部已向国际航空运输协会和外国政府，机场，航空承运人以及移民当局警告新的护照套设计。
他说：“鉴于对第一个问题的温和务实的解决方案，我预计对华航改名也将采取类似的负责任的态度。”

TAIPEI - Taiwan on Wednesday (Sept 2) unveiled the island's new passport cover, which enlarges the letters spelling out "Taiwan" and shrinks the name "Republic of China" to barely visible print, thus setting the travel document apart from a Chinese passport.
While Taiwan's official name is the Republic of China (ROC), the idea was to give more attention to the word "Taiwan", according to the Foreign Ministry.
Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said: “The new passport is more recognisable and emphasises the Taiwanese elements.
The Foreign Ministry has alerted the International Air Transport Association and foreign governments, airports, air carriers as well as immigration authorities to the new passport cover design, said Mr Wu.
"Given the moderate and pragmatic resolution to this first problem, I anticipate a similar level-headed solution to the China Airlines name change," he noted.

雅加达-专家说，印尼的Covid-19检出率在感染人数最高的国家中是最低的，但距离爆发的高峰还很遥远，他们认为检测结果呈阳性的比例仍然很高。
印尼大学的流行病学家潘都·里诺（Pandu Riono）也怀疑印尼的流行曲线会在下个月开始趋于平缓，并表示会在明年。
印度尼西亚拥有2.67亿人口，应将测试能力提高到每周267,000人。
乔科总统说，印尼的测试率仍然落后于人力限制，并补充说它正在努力培训更多的人。
印度尼西亚记录了180,646例确诊病例，是仅次于菲律宾的东南亚第二大病例，死亡7,616人，是该地区截至9月2日的最高病例。

JAKARTA - Indonesia, whose Covid-19 testing rate is the lowest among countries with the highest infection numbers, is still far from the peak of the outbreak, experts said, arguing that the fraction of tests that come back positive is still high.
University of Indonesia epidemiologist Pandu Riono also doubted Indonesia could see its epidemic curve starting to flatten out next month, saying it would be next year.
With a 267 million population, Indonesia should raise testing capacity to 267,000 persons per week.
President Joko said Indonesia's still lagging testing rate is due to manpower constraints, adding that it is trying to train more people.
Indonesia recorded 180,646 confirmed cases, the second highest in South-east Asia after the Philippines, and 7,616 deaths, the highest in the region as of Sept 2.

分析人士说，急需新的刺激方案以推动印度经济增长，而印度曾经是世界上增长最快的经济体。
周一（8月31日），政府数据显示，印度经济表现最差，自1996年以来，该国首次开始发布季度国内生产总值（GDP）数据。
农业，林业和渔业很少出现正面影响，增长了0.4％，至3.4％。
即使在冠状病毒大流行使经济脱轨之前，印度已经面临着经济放缓和失业增长的逆风。
许多人认为，除非印度控制大流行，否则经济复苏仍将成问题。

Analysts say a fresh stimulus package is much needed to push growth in the Indian economy, once the fastest growing in the world.
On Monday (Aug 31), government data revealed that the Indian economy is performing at its worst since 1996, when the country first started publishing quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) figures.
A rare positive - agriculture, forestry and fishing, which inched up 0.4 per cent to 3.4 per cent.
India was already facing headwinds with a slowing economy and jobless growth even before the coronavirus pandemic derailed the economy.
And many believe that until India gets the pandemic under control, economic recovery would remain problematic.

金边（路透社）-高棉的指挥官杜赫同志（Pol Pot的主要execution子手和安全首长）在臭名昭著的吐斯廉监狱中杀害了至少14,000名柬埔寨人，他于周三死亡。
杜赫死于金边的高棉苏维埃友谊医院的凌晨00.52（格林尼治标准时间1752），死于金边的高棉苏维埃友谊医院。
杜赫（Duch）是高棉胭脂在死前被定罪的少数几个顶尖人物之一。
对于红色高棉而言，这可能意味着从学校老师到孩子，从孕妇到被识别为戴着眼镜的“情报分子”的任何人。
他的父母遭受酷刑折磨，被杀，但陈帕尔先生幸存下来，在2010年杜赫（Duch）的审判中作证。

PHNOM PENH (REUTERS) - The Khmer Rouge commander known as Comrade Duch, Pol Pot’s main executioner and security chief who oversaw the murder of at least 14,000 Cambodians at the notorious Tuol Sleng prison, died on Wednesday.
Duch died at 00.52 a.m. (1752 GMT on Tuesday) at the Khmer Soviet Friendship Hospital in Phnom Penh, said Mr Neth Pheaktra, a spokesman for a tribunal set up to prosecute top Khmer Rouge leaders.
Duch was one of only a handful of top Khmer Rouge figures convicted before they died.
For the Khmer Rouge, that could mean anyone from school teachers to children, to pregnant women and “intellectuals” identified as such for wearing glasses.
His parents were tortured and killed but Mr Chan Phal survived to give testimony at Duch’s trial in 2010.

印度尼西亚班尼万吉（AFP）-卫生部官员说，印尼600多名伊斯兰学校学生的冠状病毒检测呈阳性，这是全国教室重新开放的最新爆发。
在至少664名学生被感染后，东爪哇省Banyuwangi摄政区的达鲁萨兰国Blokagung寄宿学校发起了为期两周的隔离工作，隔离了约6,000名学生。
大多数病例没有轻度或没有症状，但当地警察和军方封锁了学校的通行通道。
据学校称，在一些学生抱怨感觉不适之后，从8月中旬开始进行大规模测试。
印度尼西亚军事学院的近1300人在7月份对该病毒进行了阳性检测后，发生了大规模感染。

BANYUWANGI, INDONESIA (AFP) - More than 600 Islamic school students in Indonesia have tested positive for the coronavirus, a health ministry official said, marking the latest outbreak as classrooms reopen across the country.
The Darussalam Blokagung boarding school in East Java's Banyuwangi regency has initiated a two-week quarantine of some 6,000 students after at least 664 students were infected.
Most of the cases had mild or no symptoms but the local police and the military have blocked access to the school.
Mass testing had been carried out from the middle of August after some students complained of feeling unwell, according to the school.
The mass infection comes after nearly 1,300 people at an Indonesian military academy tested positive for the virus in July.
