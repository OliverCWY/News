(CNN) Sex in a pandemic can be complicated, Canada's lead medical doctor says, and it's best to skip kissing and perhaps wear a mask to prevent spreading Covid-19.

Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, issued a public statement Wednesday on staying safe from the virus when engaging in sexual activities.

"Sexual health is an important part of our overall health. However, sex can be complicated in the time of Covid-19..." the statement says, with risks increasing for partners engaging with people outside their household.

Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said sex should be avoided if either partner had Covid-19 symptoms.

"The lowest risk sexual activity during Covid-19 involves yourself alone," Tam advises. But for Canadians choosing to "engage in an in-person sexual encounter" outside their bubble, she suggests a number of steps to reduce risk including "avoiding face-to-face contact or closeness."

A trusting relationship should first be established and partners should also consider using a mask that covers the nose and mouth, Tam says.
