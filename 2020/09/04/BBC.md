Daniel Prude, who had mental health issues, died after being put in a "spit hood", a device meant to stop those arrested spitting on people.
Announcing the suspension Rochester's mayor, Lovely Warren, said systemic racism led to the death.
Mr Prude died in March but his story has only just been made public.
The move to suspend the seven officers is the first disciplinary action since Mr Prude's death.

拜登说，仍然在医院处于瘫痪状态的布莱克表示，无论他再走还是不走，“他都不会放弃”。
但是，拜登先生指责特朗普煽动种族分裂。
威斯康星州州长托尼·埃弗斯（Tony Evers）说，他“宁愿没人在这里，无论是候选人特朗普还是候选人拜登”。
乔·拜登（Joe Biden）和他的妻子在密尔沃基（Milwaukee）机场会见了布莱克（Blake）的亲戚，布莱克（Blake）打电话。
拜登说：“布雷克说：“没有什么能打败他，无论他再次走还是不走，他都不会放弃。”

Mr Blake, who remains in hospital paralysed, said "he was not going to give up" whether he walked again or not, Mr Biden said.
However, Mr Biden has accused Mr Trump of stoking racial division.
Wisconsin's Governor, Tony Evers, said he would "prefer that no-one be here, be it candidate Trump or candidate Biden".
Joe Biden and his wife met Mr Blake's relatives at Milwaukee airport, with Mr Blake on the phone.
Mr Blake "talked about how nothing was going to defeat him, how whether he walked again or not, he was not going to give up," Mr Biden said.

Anon Nampa和Panupong Jadnok上个月因在曼谷举行的抗议活动而被拘留，抗议要求进行政治改革。
周四，曼谷一家法院裁定，36岁的阿农（Anon）和24岁的帕努蓬（Panupong）参加抗议活动，违反了他们的保释条件。
人权律师阿农（Anon）表示，他再次被拘留构成骚扰。
“我在监狱外的职责已经结束，我想赌博一切以求改变，”阿农在法庭听证会前在Facebook上写道。
Anon先生和Panupong先生因8月3日在曼谷举行的以哈利·波特为主题的抗议而被捕。

Anon Nampa and Panupong Jadnok were detained last month over a protest in Bangkok at which calls for political reform were made.
On Thursday a court in Bangkok ruled that Mr Anon, 36, and Mr Panupong, 24, had breached their bail conditions by taking part in protests.
Mr Anon, a human rights lawyer, said his renewed detention amounted to harassment.
"My duty outside of prison has ended, and I wanted to gamble everything for change," Mr Anon wrote in a Facebook post before the court hearing.
Mr Anon and Mr Panupong were arrested over a Harry Potter-themed protest that took place in Bangkok on 3 August.

## 花木兰评论：真人重制是“无幽默感”

### Mulan review: Live-action remake is ‘humourless and sombre’

迪士尼的《花木兰》是一部杰作：寓教于乐，光彩夺目，在艺术角度和图像运用上引人注目，在女权主义和积极展现亚洲人物方面大胆。
让我们继续进行真人重制，将其与出色的前作相比，这是令人羡慕的。
花木兰取得巨大成功的压力越来越大，所以我应该马上说，事实并非如此。
迷迷们会听到动画片的翻拍省略了歌曲，笑话和会说话的龙，而感到沮丧。
当一条毛巾从战友的腰上滑下来时，木兰畏缩了一下，但除此之外，这部电影甚至比卡通片更加y。

Disney’s Mulan is a masterpiece: entertaining, sparklingly funny, striking in its use of artistic angles and imagery, and bold in its feminism and its positive representation of Asian characters.
Let’s move on to the live-action remake, which is in the unenviable position of being compared to its splendid predecessor.
The pressure is on for Mulan to be a staggering success, so I should say right away that, well, it isn’t.
Fans of the cartoon will be dismayed to hear that the remake omits the songs, the jokes, and the talking dragon.
Mulan winces when a towel slips from the waist of a comrades-in-arms, but otherwise the film is even more coy than the cartoon was.

十层高的Pascha是科隆市的主要地标。
妓院的主任阿明对当地报纸《快报》说：“我们结束了。”
通常，大约有120名妓女在Pascha工作。
一些团体提出了这样的担忧，即关闭合法妓院可能会因为妓女被迫在地下经营而使她们面临更大的危险。

"We are at an end," the brothel's director, Armin , told local paper Express.
Some 120 prostitutes usually work at Pascha.
Some groups have raised concerns that closing legal brothels could leave prostitutes in greater danger as they are forced to operate underground.

然后，该小组使用扫描仪从内部搜索心跳或呼吸，并配备了挖掘残骸的设备。
半岛电视台的记者Zeina Khodr发推文说：“搜索小组说，他们发现了尸体，可能是一个在瓦砾下心跳的人”。

It is still unknown if a person is alive under the rubble.
The rescuers were passing the building on Wednesday night when their dog gave a sign there was a person alive inside.
The group then used a scanner to search for a heartbeat or a breath from within, and came with equipment to dig down into the rubble.
Al-Jazeera's correspondent Zeina Khodr tweeted that "search teams say they detected a body and what could be a person with a heartbeat under the rubble".

运输部表示，关于在隔离区中添加或删除国家/地区的决定“要考虑到一系列因素”，包括要检测的人数。
威尔士引入的最新隔离规定适用于来自葡萄牙，直布罗陀，六个希腊岛屿和法属波利尼西亚的旅客。
苏格兰已经针对希腊入境者重新引入了自我隔离措施，现在将葡萄牙和法属玻里尼西亚加入了需要隔离的国家名单。
这高于20的阈值，当时英国政府通常考虑触发隔离条件。
“不过，要提醒度假者-14天检疫国家可以并且在很短的时间内做出改变。”

The Department for Transport said decisions around adding or removing countries from the quarantine list "take into account a range of factors" - including how many people are being tested.
The latest quarantine rules introduced in Wales apply to travellers from Portugal, Gibraltar, six Greek islands and French Polynesia.
Scotland has already reintroduced self-isolation measures for arrivals from Greece and has now added Portugal and French Polynesia to its list of countries requiring quarantine.
This is above the threshold of 20 which is when the UK government generally considers triggering quarantine conditions.
"Nonetheless, holidaymakers are reminded - 14-day quarantine countries can and do change at very short notice."

总统马克龙（Emmanuel Macron）政府表示，这项投资将包括在绿色能源和运输方面的巨额支出。
它被称为“法国重新启动”，旨在扭转失业率上升的趋势，并包括企业减税措施。
其余的投资计划将用于支持就业，培训和更广泛的社会计划，以期明年创造至少16万个就业机会。
“我们都知道你可以拥有正确的视野，但是没有执行力的视野只是幻觉。”
法国目前正处于欧洲最严重的经济衰退之一，预计到2020年整体经济产出将下降11％。

President Emmanuel Macron's government said the investment would include big spending on green energy and transport.
Dubbed "France re-launch", it is aimed at reversing rising unemployment, and includes tax cuts for business.
The rest of the investment package will go on supporting jobs, training and broader social initiatives with the aim of creating at least 160,000 jobs next year.
"We all know that you can have the right vision, but vision without execution is just hallucination."
France is on course for one of Europe's worst recessions, with an 11% drop in economic output forecast for 2020 as a whole.

在线零售巨头亚马逊表示，今年将再创造7,000个英国工作岗位，以满足不断增长的需求。
这将使其在英国的永久员工总数超过40,000。
最新的零售数据显示，英国7月份的在线销售量比2月份的大流行前水平高出50％以上。
亚马逊将再创造7,000个永久性就业机会的消息也许应该不足为奇。
乐购（Tesco）在八月份表示，由于封锁导致在线业务“异常增长”，它将创造16,000个永久性工作。

Image copyright Getty ImagesOnline retail giant Amazon has said it will create a further 7,000 UK jobs this year to meet growing demand.
This will take its total permanent UK workforce to more than 40,000.
The latest retail sales figures showed that UK online sales in July were more than 50% higher than pre-pandemic levels in February.
The news that Amazon is creating another 7,000 permanent jobs should perhaps come as no surprise.
Tesco said in August that it would create 16,000 permanent jobs after lockdown led to "exceptional growth" in its online business.
