美国人如何处理劳动节周末是至关重要的随着即将到来的假期周末，福西向美国公众发出了“请愿”，不要重蹈过去假期的覆辙。
但是在劳动节周末发生的事情很关键。
安迪·贝许（Andy Beshear）还强调了安全预防措施的重要性，因为他所在的州在本劳动节周末主办了肯塔基德比大赛（Kentucky Derby）。
“我想敦促所有大学生进入劳动节周末，我知道许多人可能只是因为刚到校园而不会回家。
帕森说：“我知道现在有很多关于大学生的担忧。”

How Americans handle Labor Day weekend is criticalWith the upcoming holiday weekend, Fauci made a "plea to the American public" not to repeat the mistakes from past holidays.
But what happens over Labor Day weekend is critical.
Andy Beshear also stressed the importance of safety precautions as his state hosts the Kentucky Derby this Labor Day weekend, which will run without fans in the stands.
"I want to urge all of the college students as we go into the Labor Day weekend, I understand many will probably not be going home since they just got on campus.
"I know there is a lot of concern right now regarding college students," Parson said.

（CNN）白宫冠状病毒特别工作组在夏季向各州提出了越来越紧急的口罩建议，但只有六个州大部分都忽略了它们。
该工作组拒绝公开报道，但众议院冠状病毒小组委员会于6月23日至8月9日发表了每份报告。
报告显示，工作队针对每个州提出了量身定制的建议，包括有关口罩使用的建议。
但是报告显示，工作队试图鼓励各州强制使用口罩，尽管有些州实际上忽略了这些建议。
报告中使用的语言加强了对佐治亚州，爱荷华州和俄克拉荷马州等州的建议，因为夏季爆发这些州。

(CNN) The White House coronavirus task force gave increasingly urgent recommendations to states about masks over the summer, only to have them mostly ignored by six states, their weekly reports show.
The task force has declined to make the reports public, but the House Select Subcommittee on Coronavirus published each report , from June 23 up to August 9, earlier this week.
The reports show that the task force made tailored recommendations to each state -- including recommendations about mask use.
But the reports show that the task force tried to encourage states to mandate mask use, even as some states essentially ignored those recommendations.
The language in the reports intensifies in recommendations for states such as Georgia, Iowa and Oklahoma as outbreaks occurred over the summer months in those states.

（CNN）加拿大主要医学医生说，大流行中的性行为可能会很复杂，最好避免接吻或戴口罩以防止传播Covid-19。
加拿大首席公共卫生官谭丽莎博士周三发表了一份公开声明，称在进行性活动时应避免感染病毒。
“性健康是我们整体健康的重要组成部分。
加拿大首席公共卫生官特蕾莎·谭（Theresa Tam）表示，如果任何一方都患有Covid-19症状，则应避免发生性行为。
Tam建议：“在Covid-19期间发生性行为的风险最低，只有你自己一个人参与。”

(CNN) Sex in a pandemic can be complicated, Canada's lead medical doctor says, and it's best to skip kissing and perhaps wear a mask to prevent spreading Covid-19.
Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, issued a public statement Wednesday on staying safe from the virus when engaging in sexual activities.
"Sexual health is an important part of our overall health.
Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said sex should be avoided if either partner had Covid-19 symptoms.
"The lowest risk sexual activity during Covid-19 involves yourself alone," Tam advises.

（CNN）在任何一天，唐纳德·特朗普总统都会在推特上转发数十个，有时甚至是数百个。
特朗普在2019年在加利福尼亚州的一次演讲中说：“当总统，这件事使我付出了一笔财富。”
帕斯卡尔在广告中说：“特朗普总统在任期间取得的成就超过历史上任何一位总统。”
“我们需要让特朗普总统知道我们感谢他为美国所做的一切。
我需要您在屏幕上拨打该电话，并向特朗普总统表示感谢。”

(CNN) On any given day, President Donald Trump will tweet or retweet dozens -- and sometimes hundreds -- of things.
"This thing is costing me a fortune, being president," Trump said in a speech in California in 2019.
"President Trump has achieved more during his time in office than any president in history," Parscale said in the ad .
"We need to let President Trump know that we appreciate what he's doing for America.
I need you to call the number on your screen and deliver a thank you to President Trump."

## 情报公告警告俄罗斯扩大虚假声明邮寄投票将导致广泛欺诈

一天前，总检察长比尔·巴尔在接受美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）的沃尔夫·闪电茨（Wolf Blitzer）采访时谴责各州鼓励邮寄投票，从而发出警告。
国土安全部文件的消息引起众议院情报委员会民主党主席亚当·希夫（Adam Schiff）的立即批评。
巴尔还淡化了情报界的评估，即俄罗斯是唯一积极干预2020年选举的国家。
负责保护2020年大选的美国高级情报官员最近表示，没有证据表明外国正在干涉该国的邮寄投票程序。
今年，全国两党官员扩大了邮寄投票方式，公共卫生当局正在鼓励将其作为一种对大流行病友好的投票方式。

The warning comes one day after Attorney General Bill Barr condemned states for encouraging mail-in voting in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer.
News of the DHS document prompted immediate criticism from the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Rep. Adam Schiff.
Barr also diluted the intelligence community's assessment that Russia is the only country actively interfering in the 2020 election.
Senior US intelligence officials, tasked with protecting the 2020 election, recently said that there is no evidence that foreign countries are interfering with the mail-in voting process in this country.
Bipartisan officials across the country have expanded mail-in voting this year, and public health authorities are encouraging it as a pandemic-friendly way to vote.

02:21伦敦国际战略研究所中国防务政策研究员梅亚·诺文斯（Meia Nouwens）表示：“美国试图在对中国视作破坏台湾海峡稳定之时，非常明确地向台湾作出保证。
头条新闻说：“美国打算迫使中国对台湾发动“第一枪”。
援引中国大陆的军事分析家的话说，如果美国向台湾派出侦察机，中国的军事行动可能是合理的。
防御姿态台湾地理位置优越，自卫自,，它与大陆之间坐落着一片太平洋-台湾海峡。
“他们（人民解放军）仍然必须在台湾海峡吸引数十万人，才能取得胜利。”

02:21"The US is attempting to make its assurances to Taiwan very clear at a time when it views China as destabilizing the Taiwan Strait," said Meia Nouwens, research fellow for China defense policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.
"US intends to force China to 'fire first shot' over Taiwan," the headline read.
Citing military analysts on the Chinese mainland, it said if the US had sent reconnaissance planes over Taiwan, Chinese military action could be justified.
Defensive postureTaiwan is well situated to defend itself, with a stretch of the Pacific Ocean -- the Taiwan Strait -- sitting between it and the mainland.
"They (the PLA) still have to get hundreds of thousands of people across the Taiwan Strait in order to prevail."

最新的公告说：“人们似乎认为她没有被剥夺王室地位，她的王室军事地位和军衔以及她所有的王室装饰品从未被召回。”
由于泰国严格的最高法令，CNN在报道泰国君主制及其宫殿阴谋的全部背景方面有局限性。
Sineenat是近一个世纪以来的第一位皇家配偶。
在2019年7月被任命为王室配偶后，她担任该职位仅三个月，之后被剥夺了头衔。
长期以来，人们一直对泰国王室表示不满，这是固执的，激进的甚至是危险的-不仅仅是因为雄伟的法律。

"It is regarded as if she was not stripped of her royal status, her royal military position and military rank and all her royal decorations were never recalled before," the latest announcement read.
Due to Thailand's stringent lese majeste law, CNN has limits in reporting the full context surrounding the Thai monarchy and its palace intrigue.
Sineenat is the first royal consort in nearly a century.
After being named royal consort in July 2019, she held the post for only three months before being stripped of her titles.
Expressing any dissatisfaction with the Thai royal family has long been considered verboten, radical and even dangerous -- and not just because of the lese majeste laws.

其中包括世界最大，最赚钱的石油生产国沙特阿美。
考虑到某些项目的政治敏感性，重新安排优先事项可能对公司和沙特王国产生长期影响。
Facts Global Energy中东总经理伊曼•纳西里（Iman Nasseri）说：“总是涉及政治。”
预计该公司还将向沙特政府付款，该国依靠石油收入为沉重的社会和军事开支提供资金。
纳西里说：“沙特是一个石油州，阿美是一家石油公司。”

That includes Saudi Aramco, the world's largest and most profitable oil producer.
The realignment of priorities could have long term consequences for the company and the Saudi kingdom, given the politically sensitive nature of some projects.
"There's always politics involved," said Iman Nasseri, Middle East managing director at Facts Global Energy.
The company is also expected to make payouts to the Saudi government, which relies on oil income to fund heavy social and military spending.
"Saudi is an oil state and Aramco is an oil company," Nasseri said.

The shifts disrupt our sleep schedules and harm our health, according to experts at the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.
"It's like filling a cup with water," said Ramar, explaining the timing of the AASM's call to end daylight saving time now.
There is an average electricity savings of 0.34% during daylight saving time, according to an international metanalytic study from 2017.
"In daylight saving time, it's still dark in the morning and it gets really bright in the evening.
States that would prefer year-round daylight saving time are mostly out of luck — US federal law does not allow it.

该硬币被称为“飘逸的头发”，一面有自由女神像，另一面有老鹰。
拥有稀有的1794银元的布鲁斯·莫雷兰（Bruce Morelan）对CNN表示：“这是一枚梦想中的钱币，我一直为自己拥有的无价之宝而感到自豪，我很遗憾看到它的成功。”
穆德说，在生产的1758张飘逸的银元中，仍然只有130-140枚硬币存在。
他说，仔细检查一百多个硬币，进一步证明了莫兰的1794银元的独特特征。
Legend of Auctions将于10月8日在拉斯维加斯的威尼斯人酒店进行The Flowing Hair硬币的销售。

Dubbed the "Flowing Hair" dollar, the coin features a portrait of Lady Liberty on one side and an eagle on the other.
"This is a dream coin -- a priceless artifact that I have been proud to own, and I'm very sorry to see it go," Bruce Morelan, who owns the rare 1794 silver dollar, told CNN.
Of the 1,758 Flowing Hair Silver Dollars produced, Mudd said that there are only 130-140 coins still in existence.

Whereas before, oil-based materials like Nylon had at least one environmental advantage over natural materials -- being easier to recycle -- Evrnu hopes that natural materials can now match them on that measure too.

关于道德时尚和可持续性的广泛误解有时会阻止消费者在生活方式上采取有意义的行动。
误区：从“环保意识”或“可持续”品牌购买商品是减少时尚足迹的最佳方法真相：减少时尚足迹的最佳方法是少买东西。
研究可持续品牌是有帮助的，但是购买新产品应该是最后的选择，而不是第一个选择。
误解：奢侈时尚比快时尚更具可持续性真相：花钱购买奢侈时尚并不能保证可持续性。
麦肯锡（McKinsey）的萨斯基亚·赫德里奇（Saskia Hedrich）告诉美国有线电视新闻网，“评估可持续时尚的客观标准缺失。

Widespread misconceptions about ethical fashion and sustainability can sometimes keep consumers from taking meaningful action when it comes to their lifestyles.
MYTH: Buying from "eco-conscious" or "sustainable" brands is the best way to reduce your fashion footprintTRUTH: The best way to reduce your fashion footprint is to buy fewer things.
Researching sustainable brands is helpful, but buying something new should be the last option, not the first.
MYTH: Luxury fashion is more sustainable than fast fashionTRUTH: Spending money on luxury fashion does not guarantee sustainability.
"Objective criteria for rating sustainable fashion are missing," McKinsey's Saskia Hedrich told CNN.

如今，我们许多人购买新衣服的次数过多，而对我们已经拥有的衣物的保存时间不够久。
2017年，环境保护署报告称，美国有1,120万吨纺织废料最终被填埋。
因此，在首次穿上衣服时扔掉衣服之前，请考虑如何延长衣柜的使用寿命。
如果您洒了茶或咖啡，请将衣物浸入水和醋中。
升级和重新使用有时，衣服无法保存为当前形式，但可以在壁橱中重生。

Today, many of us are buying new clothes too often, and not holding on to what we already own for long enough.
In 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency reported that 11.2 million tons of textile waste in the US ended up in landfills.
So before throwing out a garment at the first sign of wear, consider how you can extend your wardrobe's lifespan.
If you spilled your tea or coffee, soak the garment in water and vinegar.
Upcycling and repurposingSometimes a garment can't be saved in its current form, but it can have a second life in your closet.

每个地点都是独一无二的，但斯坦因茨注意到了一个共同的主题-人类正在改变地球。
在2018年《纽约时报》（New York Times）杂志派遣他到各个大洲记录气候变化之后，斯坦梅茨决定整理一本书，收集他整个职业生涯的图像。
“人类星球”记载了我们对环境的影响以及为保护环境而提出的解决方案。
偶然的环保主义者这种鸟瞰世界使Steinmetz能够见证并记录人类改变地球的方式。
这位摄影师说他不打算记录气候变化，但他的工作档案使人类的足迹不可否认。

Each location was unique, but the Steinmetz noticed a common theme -- humans were changing the planet.
After a 2018 New York Times Magazine assignment that sent him to every continent to document climate change, Steinmetz decided to put together a book, collecting images spanning his whole career.
"Human Planet" chronicles our impact on the environment and the solutions we have come up with to try to save it.
The accidental environmentalistThis bird's-eye view of the world allowed Steinmetz to witness -- and document -- the ways humans have changed the planet.
The photographer says he didn't intend to document climate change, but his archive of work made humanity's footprint undeniable.

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-通过吸引人的飞机制服吸引公众注意力时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常为白色，但并非总是如此（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板应用了最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，合并和收购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
