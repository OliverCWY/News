(CNN) Miley Cyrus' breakup with Liam Hemsworth didn't happen the way you might believe.

The singer/actress appeared on a recent episode of Joe Rogan's podcast and talked about everything from quitting smoking to her divorce.

She told Rogan that it was tough to go through a very public divorce.

"What really sucked about it wasn't the fact that me and someone that I loved realized that we don't love each other the way that we used to anymore, that's OK, I can accept that," she said. "I can't accept the villainizing, and just all those stories. It's amazing that the public kind of thinks there's no gap of time they didn't see that could possibly be what led to this."
