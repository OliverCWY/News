新德里-印度在周三（9月2日）的24小时内录得了83,883例冠状病毒新高，与此同时，印度政府开始准备开放地铁服务，这是其放松锁定限制措施的一部分。
印度是世界第二大人口大国，拥有13.5亿人口，是第三大受Covid-19影响的国家，拥有385万例。
德里在周三记录了2509个新闻案件，但市政府已排除第二波新闻。
该病毒仍在德里存在，”德里卫生部长萨蒂恩达尔·贾恩（Satyendar Jain）告诉记者。
自分阶段以来，限制有所放松，最近的举措是在解锁4中恢复地铁服务。

NEW DELHI - India recorded a new high of 83,883 coronavirus cases over 24 hours on Wednesday (Sept 2), just as the government started preparing to open metro services as part of its effort to ease lockdown restrictions.
India is the world's second most populous country, with 1.35 billion people, and the third most affected by Covid-19, with 3.85 million cases.
Delhi recorded 2,509 news cases on Wednesday but the city government has ruled out a second wave.
The virus is still there in Delhi," Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain told reporters.
Restrictions have eased since in phases, with the latest move to resume metro services in what is being called Unlock 4.

美国最高外交官迈克·蓬佩奥（Mike Pompeo）周三介绍了上述限制措施，其中包括要求中国外交官寻求批准访问大学或与当地官员会面。
美国驻华大使馆发言人说，准许在最后一刻被“常规拒绝”或取消。
华春莹告诉记者，对中国外交官的限制是“严重违反国际法和国际关系的基本准则”。
美国大使馆发言人告诉法新社，美国并未反映“中国严峻限制的所有方面”。
相关报道美国加强了对中国外交官的限制，北京敦促华盛顿停止阻碍正常的人员往来。不过，此举可能会加剧两国之间的外交敌对行动。

America's top diplomat, Mr Mike Pompeo, introduced the restrictions on Wednesday, including mandating Chinese diplomats to seek approval to visit universities or meet local officials.
A US Embassy spokesman in Beijing said permission is "routinely denied" or cancelled at the last minute.
The curbs on Chinese diplomats are "a serious violation of the international law and the basic norms of international relations", Ms Hua Chunying told reporters.
The US Embassy spokesman told AFP the US was not mirroring "every aspect of China's severe constraints".

北京-近几个月来，中国的审查制度愈演愈烈，因为北京正努力应对Covid-19大流行，并且与美国的关系日益紧张。
多伦多大学公民实验室的研究人员进行的一项新研究发现，从1月到5月，中国应用程序微信屏蔽了2,000多个与Covid-19相关的关键字。

BEIJING - Censorship in China has intensified in recent months, with Beijing grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic and increasingly fraught relations with the United States.
A new study by researchers at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab found that Chinese app WeChat blocked more than 2,000 keywords related to Covid-19 from January to May.

伦敦-以色列和阿拉伯联合酋长国已达成协议，宣布为两国之间的正式外交关系铺平道路，这激怒了两国领导人。
但是，这项协议的连锁反应-打破了几十年前大多数阿拉伯国家发誓的誓言，除非巴勒斯坦人的命运得到解决，否则将不与以色列建立正常关系-继续在整个中东引起强烈反应。

LONDON - The announcement that Israel and the United Arab Emirates had reached an agreement paving the way for official diplomatic relations between the two has galvanised the leaders of both nations.
But the ripple effects of this deal - which breaks a vow most Arab states made decades ago not to normalise ties with Israel unless the fate of the Palestinians is settled - continues to generate strong reactions throughout the Middle East.

海上事务和投资协调部长认为，将Covid-19测试数字与一个国家的总人口比例提供一个偏斜的观点，可以涵盖覆盖多个广阔而偏远地理区域的国家。
因此，Worldometer的每人口数量测试率对他的国家无效。
Bangka Belitung记录了235例Covid-19阳性病例，并记录了该地区150万人的死亡人数。
Covid-19病例最多的六个印尼省份是雅加达，东爪哇，中爪哇，南苏拉威西岛，西爪哇和南加里曼丹。
印度尼西亚人口约2.7亿，截至周三，已记录180 646例确诊的Covid-19病例，康复129 971例，死亡7616例。

The coordinating minister for maritime affairs and investment has argued that giving a ratio of Covid-19 testing numbers to a country's overall population provides a skewed perspective of countries covering multiple vast and remote geographical regions.
Hence, Worldometer's testing rate per population measure is not valid for his country.
Bangka Belitung has recorded 235 positive Covid-19 cases and two fatalities in the 1.5 million people that reside there.
The six Indonesian provinces with the most Covid-19 cases are Jakarta, East Java, Central Java, South Sulawesi, West Java and South Kalimantan.
Indonesia has a population of about 270 million and has recorded 180,646 confirmed Covid-19 cases, with 129,971 recoveries and 7,616 deaths as of Wednesday.

她说：“自然灾害的损害一直是朝鲜官方媒体高度敏感的话题，在国家电视台显示洪水现场的近实时新闻报道是不可想象的，”
面向世界的信息近年来，朝鲜也涉足了面向更多全球受众的在线媒体。
其中一个推特账号带有\#ColdNoodleFan句柄-向朝鲜最著名的菜式致敬-自称是朝鲜的“反战，和平倡导者和公正的新闻”。
威廉姆斯表示，朝鲜的中文努力似乎更加成功，在微博上有533,000名追随者。
茨科说：“这些举措的目标似乎是使社会媒体对朝鲜产生一些积极的信息，或者至少使人们对他们在其他地方对朝鲜的了解持怀疑态度。”

"Damage from natural disasters has always been a highly sensitive topic for North Korean state media, and showing near-real-time news reports from flood sites on state TV was unthinkable," she said.
A MESSAGE FOR THE WORLDIn recent years, North Korea has dabbled in online media aimed at a more global audience as well.
Among them are a Twitter account with the handle \#ColdNoodleFan - a nod to one of North Korea's most famous dishes - which described itself as "anti-war, peace advocate and unbiased news" on North Korea.
And North Korea's Chinese-language efforts appear to be even more successful, with 533,000 followers on Weibo, according to Mr Williams.
"The goals of these initiatives seem to be to saturate social media with some positive messages on North Korea, or at least make people sceptical about what they read about North Korea elsewhere," Mr Zwirko said.

华盛顿（法新社）-Facebook表示，将在美国大选前一周禁止政治广告，这是反对虚假信息的最全面举措之一，但首席执行官马克•扎克伯格（Mark Zuckerberg）在投票后警告称有“内乱的危险”。

他几乎每天都声称增加邮寄投票权是“操纵”针对他的选举的一种手段，而他拒绝透露他是否会接受结果。

WASHINGTON (AFP) - Facebook says it will ban political advertising the week before the US election, one of its most sweeping moves against disinformation yet as CEO Mark Zuckerberg warned of a "risk of civil unrest" after the vote.
The US remains the epicentre of the world's worst coronavirus outbreak, and voters are expected to shift to mail-in voting, with an estimated three-quarters of the population eligible to do so.
Almost daily, he claims that increased mail-in voting is a gambit to "rig" the election against him, and he has refused to say whether he will accept the results.
