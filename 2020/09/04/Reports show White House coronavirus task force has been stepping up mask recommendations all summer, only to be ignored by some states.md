(CNN) The White House coronavirus task force gave increasingly urgent recommendations to states about masks over the summer, only to have them mostly ignored by six states, their weekly reports show.

The task force has declined to make the reports public, but the House Select Subcommittee on Coronavirus published each report , from June 23 up to August 9, earlier this week.

The reports show that the task force made tailored recommendations to each state -- including recommendations about mask use.

The Trump administration's mask messaging -- particularly from the President himself -- has been inconsistent and confusing as the pandemic has progressed with no uniform national strategy in place as the pandemic has spread rapidly through the country, infecting more than 6 million and killing more than 185,000. But the reports show that the task force tried to encourage states to mandate mask use, even as some states essentially ignored those recommendations.

The language in the reports intensifies in recommendations for states such as Georgia, Iowa and Oklahoma as outbreaks occurred over the summer months in those states.
