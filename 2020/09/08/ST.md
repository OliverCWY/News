在本周北京贸易博览会上展出的一小瓶液体寄予了很高的希望-由中国公司Sinovac Biotech和Sinopharm生产的候选疫苗。
周一（9月7日），交易会上的人们挤在摊位上，展示着潜在的改变游戏规则的疫苗。
中国因其对流感大流行的早期处理而面临着外国批评的风暴，它一直在试图改变Covid-19的故事。
今年五月，习近平主席保证将中国研制的任何潜在疫苗都视为“全球公益”。
截至上个月，已在全球订购了至少57亿剂正在开发中的疫苗。

High hopes hang on the small vials of liquid on show at a Beijing trade fair this week - vaccine candidates produced by Chinese companies Sinovac Biotech and Sinopharm.
On Monday (Sept 7), people at the trade fair crowded around booths showing the potential game-changing vaccines.
China, which is facing a storm of foreign criticism over its early handling of the pandemic, has been trying to repurpose the story of Covid-19.
In May, President Xi Jinping pledged to make any potential vaccine developed by China a "global public good".
As of last month, at least 5.7 billion doses of the vaccines under development around the world had been pre-ordered.

我希望我可以说这在今天的香港并不常见，但是确实如此。
亲民主的立法委员克劳迪娅·莫（Claudia Mo）说，这起事件“显示出令人震惊的，令人兴奋的香港警察已经变得多么不必要”。

HONG KONG - Hong Kong police on Monday (Sept 7) drew flak over their rough arrest of a 12-year-old girl, who said she was caught in a crowd of protesters while out buying art supplies.
"When the police suddenly rushed over, I was very scared," the girl told local broadcaster i-Cable News.
I wish I could say this isn’t normal in Hong Kong today, but it is.
Pro-democracy legislator Claudia Mo said the incident "showed how unnecessarily jumpy trigger-happy Hong Kong police had become", The Guardian reported.
The group had been intercepted some 70km south-east of Hong Kong on Aug 23.

马尼拉-总统罗德里戈·杜特尔特（Rodrigo Duterte）绝对赦免了一名美国军人，他被判犯有将近五年前杀害一名菲律宾变性妇女的罪行。
杜特尔特的发言人哈里·罗克（Harry Roque）后来证实，杜特尔特“已经抹去了彭伯顿本应担任的监狱刑期”。

Mr Duterte's spokesman Harry Roque later confirmed that Mr Duterte "had erased the jail term that Pemberton should have served".

不到一周前，一名从新加坡旅行的35岁男子的Covid-19呈阳性。
PCA旅客免于接受马来西亚针对国际旅客的14天强制性检疫。
“根据这项计划（PCA），旅客只要在到达马来西亚24小时内进行的Covid-19 PCR检测为阴性，就可以免于在政府指定的中心进行为期14天的强制性检疫。”
新加坡公民和永久居民必须被隔离7天，但必须在期限结束前两天登记另一项负面结果。
在获得PCR阴性测试结果之前，必须将RGL到达者隔离在声明的住宿地点。

It came less than a week after a 35-year-old man who had travelled from Singapore tested positive for Covid-19.
The exemption for PCA travellers from undergoing Malaysia’s mandatory 14-day quarantine for international travellers remains.
“Under this scheme (PCA), travellers are exempted from going through the mandatory 14-day quarantine at government designated centres provided that their Covid-19 PCR test taken within 24 hours of arriving in Malaysia is negative,” Dr Adham said.
Singapore citizens and permanent residents are required to be in quarantine for seven days but must register another negative result two days before the period ends.
RGL arrivals are required to be quarantined at a declared accommodation until a PCR negative test result is obtained.

惠灵顿（法新社）-总理Jacinda Ardern在星期一（9月7日）在新西兰被病毒推迟的大选中恢复竞选，并赢得了引人注意的承诺，使毛利人新年成为公众假期。
如今，在新西兰最大的城市已被封锁，阿登女士启动了工党的新一轮竞选活动，并承诺将2022年的国定假日设为毛利人新年Matariki。
她说：“在新西兰旅行时，我听到了呼吁马塔里基成为公众假期的呼声，现在已经到了。”
国民党说，阿尔登女士的首要任务应该是创造就业机会，以缓解由大流行引起的经济危机，而不是宣布新的假期。
党的领导人朱迪思·柯林斯说：“问题是，这是企业必须支付的又一个公共假期。”

WELLINGTON (AFP) - Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern resumed campaigning in New Zealand's virus-delayed general election on Monday (Sept 7) with an attention-grabbing promise to make the Maori New Year a public holiday.
With lockdown now over in New Zealand's largest city, Ms Ardern kick-started her Labour party's renewed campaign with a pledge to make Matariki, the Maori New Year, a public holiday from 2022.
"As I've travelled around New Zealand I've heard the calls for Matariki to become a public holiday - its time has come," she said.
The National Party said Ms Ardern's priority should be on creating jobs to ease the economic crisis caused by the pandemic, not announcing new holidays.
"The issue is that it is another public holiday that businesses have to pay for," party leader Judith Collins said.

One of the biggest companies in that business, Recaro Aircraft Seating, has designed a range of modifications to keep passengers apart and protect them from infection.
"There is definitely large interest from across the different regions," Mr Hiller said in an interview.
Airlines are also figuring out how to apply a disinfectant coating developed by Recaro onto their seats, Mr Hiller said.
Mr Hiller said revenue is expected to drop almost 60 per cent this year.

菲律宾大学Octa研究小组负责人吉多·戴维（Guido David）教授周日（9月6日）告诉美国有线电视新闻网，“我们实际上已经弄平了（曲线）。”
各国政府用它来确定各自的Covid-19疫情是否正在增加，减少或保持稳定。
菲律宾在东南亚记录的Covid-19病例仍然最多。
截至9月，已经记录了大约17,000例新的Covid-19病例。
他说，到本月底，菲律宾的Covid-19病例仍可能超过30万。

"We’ve actually flattened (the curve)," Professor Guido David, head of the University of the Philippines’ Octa Research Team, told CNN Philippines on Sunday (Sept 6).
Governments use it as a proxy for determining whether their respective Covid-19 outbreaks are growing, shrinking or holding steady.
The Philippines still has the highest number of recorded Covid-19 cases in South-east Asia.
About 17,000 new Covid-19 cases have been recorded so far in September.
He said Covid-19 cases in the Philippines could still cross 300,000 by the end of the month.
