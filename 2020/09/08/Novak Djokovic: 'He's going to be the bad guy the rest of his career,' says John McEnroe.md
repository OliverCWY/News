(CNN) Novak Djokovic hitting a line judge with a ball has become one of the enduring images of an already bizarre season of tennis.

The 17-time grand slam winner was disqualified from the US Open, a tournament he was favorite to win to close the gap on Rafael Nadal's total of 19 grand slam wins and Roger Federer's 20.

Seven-time grand slam champion John McEnroe, who was famous for his on-court outbursts, believes the incident will have an impact.

"The pressure just got to him I think," McEnroe, himself disqualified from the 1990 Australian Open for misconduct, told ESPN . "... Now whether he likes it or not, he's going to be the bad guy the rest of his career. It'll be interesting to see how he handles it."
