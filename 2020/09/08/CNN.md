（CNN）印度官员周日说，印度军方已警告中国，指称有五名男子在喜马拉雅山争议激烈的边界附近被人民解放军“绑架”。
但是，巴格拉说，失踪人员的亲属尚未提出正式的申诉或报告，而且几乎没有“具体细节”。
他补充说：“由于该事件发生在拉美和加勒比地区附近，因此超出了地区行政部门或警察的控制范围。”
“当地消息人士（家人和朋友）提出了这一指控-亲戚说，很有可能是解放军将他们带走了。
我已派出负责人员与亲戚进行互动。

(CNN) The Indian military has alerted China to allegations five men were "abducted" by the People's Liberation Army near the countries' hotly-disputed border in the Himalayas, an Indian official said Sunday.
However, Bagra said that relatives of the missing individuals had not filed a formal complaint or report, and little "concrete details" were available.
"Since that incident occurred near the LAC, it is beyond the reach of district administration or the police," he added.
"The local sources (family and friends) have made that allegation -- the relatives said that most probably the PLA army has taken them away.
I have sent the officer in-charge to interact with the relatives.

（CNN）诺瓦克·德约科维奇（Novak Djokovic）用球击中线裁判已经成为本来就很奇怪的网球赛季的经久不衰的影像之一。
这位17届大满贯冠军被取消了美国公开赛的资格，这是他最喜欢赢得的比赛，以缩小拉斐尔·纳达尔（Rafael Nadal）的19项大满贯冠军和罗杰·费德勒（Roger Federer）的差距。
七次大满贯冠军约翰·麦肯罗（John McEnroe）以在球场上的爆发而闻名，他认为这一事件将产生影响。
“我认为压力只是施加在他身上，”麦肯罗因不当行为而被取消参加1990年澳网的资格，他告诉ESPN。
“ ...现在，不管他是否喜欢，他在整个职业生涯中都会成为坏人。

(CNN) Novak Djokovic hitting a line judge with a ball has become one of the enduring images of an already bizarre season of tennis.
The 17-time grand slam winner was disqualified from the US Open, a tournament he was favorite to win to close the gap on Rafael Nadal's total of 19 grand slam wins and Roger Federer's 20.
Seven-time grand slam champion John McEnroe, who was famous for his on-court outbursts, believes the incident will have an impact.
"The pressure just got to him I think," McEnroe, himself disqualified from the 1990 Australian Open for misconduct, told ESPN .
"... Now whether he likes it or not, he's going to be the bad guy the rest of his career.

In 2019, China's live-stream shopping market was worth 451.3 billion yuan ($66 billion), according to iResearch, a Shanghai-based market research firm .
Some local governments are even working to transform their towns into live-stream shopping hubs.
He singled out "gigs like live-stream shopping" as the kind that were "vital" to stabilizing the market.
Live-stream shopping has existed in China for years, but the trend has taken off in recent months.

（CNN）在一项出色的体育精神表现中，爱尔兰的长曲棍球队正在退出国际比赛，以允许美国原住民队参加比赛。
爱尔兰长曲棍球协会首席执行官迈克尔·肯尼迪在一份声明中说：“这绝对是正确的事。我们是世界长曲棍球协会的骄傲，我们认识到世界运动会对我们这项运动的持续发展的重要性。
尽管我们的球员很荣幸能够参加比赛，但我们知道，易洛魁族国民在国际舞台上代表我们的运动是正确的。”
根据团队在2018年国际长曲棍球世界锦标赛联合会的比赛完成情况选出八支队伍参加比赛。
易洛魁人获得了第三名，爱尔兰获得了第12名，但是国际国民运动会（IWGA）最初认为国民没有资格参加比赛。

(CNN) In a remarkable show of sportsmanship, Ireland's lacrosse team is withdrawing from an international tournament to allow a Native American team to play instead.
"It's simply the right thing to do," Michael Kennedy, chief executive officer of Ireland Lacrosse, said in a statement"We are a proud member of World Lacrosse and we recognize the importance of The World Games to the continued growth of our sport.
As much as our players would have been honored to compete, we know the right thing is for the Iroquois Nationals to represent our sport on this international stage."
Eight teams were selected to participate based on where the team finished in the 2018 Federation of International Lacrosse World Championship.
The Iroquois finished third and Ireland finished 12th, but the Nationals were initially deemed ineligible to compete by the International World Games Association (IWGA).

（CNN）-最早可能会在2025年推出超音速“空军一号”原型飞机，而美国空军正忙于授予开发合同。
上周宣布，Exosonic已获得一份合同，以开发可用作空军一号的超音速执行运输工具。
报道称，美国空军一号超音速原型机可能会在2025年推出，赫尔缪斯于2020年2月成功测试了5马赫发动机原型机。
高超声速行进通常被认为达到5马赫或以上的速度，或者是声速的五倍。
“我们仅用了九个月的时间，就以不到200万美元的价格制造了Mach 5发动机原型。”

(CNN) — There could be a supersonic Air Force One prototype airplane as early as 2025, with the US Air Force getting busy awarding development contracts.
It was announced last week that Exosonic has been issued a contract to develop supersonic executive transport that could be used as Air Force One.
A US Air Force One supersonic prototype could be rolled out by 2025, reports Military.comHermeus successfully tested a Mach 5 engine prototype in February 2020.
Hypersonic travel is generally regarded as reaching speeds of Mach 5 or above, or five times the speed of sound.
"We built a Mach 5 engine prototype in only nine months and for less than two million dollars."

Experts tested a 22.5 kg and 3-meter scale model of the futuristic airplane, developed by researchers at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands and partner Dutch airline KLM, to take the highly anticipated aircraft along its next developmental steps.
"The team optimized the scaled flight model to prevent the issue but the proof of the pudding is in the eating.
Remotely controlling the aircraft, researchers managed take off at a speed of 80 kmh, while the aircraft's flight speeds, angles and thrust were as planned, they noted.
Experts worked hard to optimize the plane: in order to improve telemetry, the team was forced to change the aircraft's center of gravity and adjust its antenna.

该范围使得Celera 500L能够为美国几乎所有配对的城市提供服务，而无需加油。
凭借其空气动力学机身，Celera 500L由RED A03发动机提供动力，因此所需的马力要小得多，以实现起飞和巡航速度。
“我们相信，当私人航空旅行的价格与商业航空旅行具有竞争力时，将产生巨大的市场机会。”
奥托航空公司还对Celera 1000L抱有远见，其中Celera 500L的规模扩大了20％，同时又保持了层流。
如果FAA认证和寻找制造工厂的计划按计划进行，那么我们可以看到Celera 500L在2025年之前首次实现商业交付。

The range is such that the Celera 500L would be able to service nearly every city pairing in the United States without refueling.
With its aerodynamic airframe meaning it requires a lot less horsepower to achieve takeoff and cruise speeds, the Celera 500L is powered by the RED A03 engine.
"We believe that when the price of private air travel is competitive with commercial air travel, an enormous market opportunity will result."
Otto AviationThe company also has visions for the Celera 1000L, whiich is the Celera 500L scaled up 20% while maintaining its laminar flow.
If FAA certification and finding a manufacturing facility goes to plan, we could see the first commercial deliveries of the Celera 500L by 2025.

（CNN）-星期六，一名奥地利男子在装满冰块的水箱中呆了两个多小时-都是以创造新的世界纪录的名义。
Koeberl说，他承担了这项挑战，这项挑战使用了1800公斤冰，以提高人们对气候变化的认识。
当我在高山高地上进行大量训练时，我想提高人们对冰川融化的认识，”他告诉CNN。
这位现年43岁的奥地利人告诉CNN，这次他持续了两个小时，三十分钟和53秒，并希望在未来的几天里，他的尝试将获得世界纪录。
Koeberl告诉CNN，如果他能找到合适的位置应对挑战，他希望明年能再创纪录。

(CNN) — An Austrian man spent more than two hours in a tank packed to the brim with ice cubes on Saturday -- all in the name of setting a new world record.
Koeberl said he undertook the challenge, which used 1800kg of ice, to raise awareness of climate change.
As I train a lot in high alpine terrain, I want to raise awareness on the melting of the glaciers," he told CNN.
The 43-year-old Austrian told CNN that this time, he lasted for two hours, 30 minutes and 53 seconds, and hopes that in the coming days his attempt will be approved as a world record.
Koeberl told CNN he hopes to attempt to push the record further next year, if he could find a suitable location for the challenge.

每个地点都是独一无二的，但斯坦因茨注意到了一个共同的主题-人类正在改变地球。
在2018年《纽约时报》（New York Times）杂志派遣他到各个大洲记录气候变化之后，斯坦梅茨决定整理一本书，收集他整个职业生涯的图像。
“人类星球”记载了我们对环境的影响以及为保护环境而提出的解决方案。
偶然的环保主义者这种对世界的鸟瞰图使Steinmetz能够见证并记录人类改变地球的方式。
这位摄影师说他不打算记录气候变化，但他的工作档案使人类的足迹不可否认。

Each location was unique, but the Steinmetz noticed a common theme -- humans were changing the planet.
After a 2018 New York Times Magazine assignment that sent him to every continent to document climate change, Steinmetz decided to put together a book, collecting images spanning his whole career.
"Human Planet" chronicles our impact on the environment and the solutions we have come up with to try to save it.
The accidental environmentalistThis bird's-eye view of the world allowed Steinmetz to witness -- and document -- the ways humans have changed the planet.
The photographer says he didn't intend to document climate change, but his archive of work made humanity's footprint undeniable.

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-通过吸引人的飞机制服吸引公众注意力时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常为白色，但并非总是如此（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板应用了最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，合并和收购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
