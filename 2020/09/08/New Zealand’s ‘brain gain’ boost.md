Though historically many Kiwis have returned to New Zealand after successful careers overseas to settle or have a family, there has not been another instance in the country’s history where huge numbers of people have chosen to return at once, where New Zealand has suddenly been more desirable than London, New York, Hong Kong and other global centres.

A new ‘brain exchange’

The steady exodus of well-qualified Kiwis was once known as the country’s “brain drain”. These days, it’s more commonly referred to as a “brain exchange”, where the people who leave are replaced with high-skilled migrants from around the world. (The country’s annual net migration is around 56,000 people: as of 2019, 27% of New Zealanders were born outside the country.)

But this new flow of returning New Zealanders “feels like a different form of brain exchange”, says economist Julie Fry, the author of Better Lives: Migration, Wellbeing and New Zealand, with “Kiwis who have developed skills and networks overseas coming back to benefit New Zealand”. This reverse migration is a great opportunity to forge connections between New Zealand and the rest of the world, she says, where those returning could share what they’d learned overseas, mentor people within New Zealand and bring international experience into the local market almost as soon as they arrived.

“Definitely we're going to be the better off, because they're going to come home when many of them would have stayed overseas, possibly indefinitely,” says Spoonley. At this early stage, it’s hard to know how many New Zealanders will leave the country again; anecdotally many, like Reid, say they have no plans to go overseas again, even once coronavirus is less of a concern. Rapidly rising house prices point to a hike in demand for permanent accommodation, while the way major cities are being changed by Covid-19 may also alter the equation. “Normally when you return from overseas to New Zealand, you miss the great things about New York or London,” says Fry. But with those cities compromised in the short to medium term, “in terms of the psychology of it, people are looking at the whole big picture”, she says, particularly when it comes to their quality of life or their children’s educational opportunities.
