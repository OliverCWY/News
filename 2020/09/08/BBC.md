乔纳森·范·坦姆（Jonathan Van Tam）教授说，人们在整个夏天“放松了太多”，“我们必须再次非常认真地对待这一问题”。
Van Tam教授发表评论之际，随着案件数量增加，英国更多地区将面临更严格的限制。
Van Tam教授说：“人们放松了太多，现在是我们重新参与并意识到这对我们的持续威胁的时候了。”
在过去两天中，我们看到的案件数量上升幅度似乎很大。
“坦率的警告”范谭教授补充说，这种趋势已经远离“特定热点”，例如上个月在莱斯特发生的热点。

Prof Jonathan Van Tam said people have "relaxed too much" over the summer and "we have got to start taking this very seriously again".
Prof Van Tam's comments came as more parts of the UK are to face tougher restrictions following a rise in the number of cases.
"People have relaxed too much, now is the time for us to re-engage, and to realise that this a continuing threat to us," Prof Van Tam said.
The rise in cases we have seen over the past two days seems like quite a large jump.
'Blunt warning'Prof Van Tam added that the trend had moved away from "specific hotspots", such as the one that occurred in Leicester last month.

The National Weather Service described Sunday as "one of the hottest days since weather records began across much of south-western California".
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire, blamed a "smoke-generating pyrotechnic device, used during a gender reveal party" for the start of the blaze.
Gender reveal parties are celebrations announcing whether expecting parents are going to have a girl or a boy.
In April 2017, a gender reveal party in Arizona sparked a week-long wildfire which burned through 45,000 acres.

## 新西兰的“脑力增长”

### New Zealand’s ‘brain gain’ boost

一种新的“人才交换”高素质的新西兰人的稳定外流曾经被称为该国的“人才流失”。
如今，人们通常将其称为“大脑交流”，在那里，离开的人们被来自世界各地的高技能移民所取代。
（该国的年度净移民人数约为56,000人：截至2019年，有27％的新西兰人在国外出生。）
Spoonley说：“当然，我们会变得更好，因为当他们中的许多人会无限期地留在海外时，他们将回家。”
“通常，当您从海外返回新西兰时，会错过有关纽约或伦敦的美好事物，”弗莱说。

A new ‘brain exchange’The steady exodus of well-qualified Kiwis was once known as the country’s “brain drain”.
These days, it’s more commonly referred to as a “brain exchange”, where the people who leave are replaced with high-skilled migrants from around the world.
(The country’s annual net migration is around 56,000 people: as of 2019, 27% of New Zealanders were born outside the country.)
“Definitely we're going to be the better off, because they're going to come home when many of them would have stayed overseas, possibly indefinitely,” says Spoonley.
“Normally when you return from overseas to New Zealand, you miss the great things about New York or London,” says Fry.

他说，随着感染率的变化，这将提供“增加的灵活性”，以便将它们添加到英格兰的隔离区中（与大陆目的地不同）。
从六个希腊岛屿到达威尔士的旅行者必须已经隔离-这些岛屿是克里特岛，莱斯沃斯岛，米科诺斯岛，帕罗斯岛和安提帕罗斯岛和扎金索斯州。
几个月来，英国政府对仅在区域范围内实施旅行隔离的想法一直保持冷淡。
威尔士政府随后还决定，就希腊而言，其旅行检疫将在区域一级进行管理，其中包括六个希腊岛屿。

He said that would provide "increased flexibility" to add or remove them from the quarantine list for England - distinct from mainland destinations - as infection rates change.
Travellers arriving in Wales from six Greek islands must already quarantine - these islands are Crete, Lesvos, Mykonos, Paros and Antiparos and Zakynthos.
For months, the UK government has been lukewarm about the idea of only applying travel quarantine on a regional basis.
The Welsh government also then decided its travel quarantine would, in the case of Greece, be managed on a regional level, with six Greek islands added to its list.

工会警告称，由于员工罢工，本月爱丁堡工厂可能停止生产Wagon Wheels和Jammie Dodger饼干。
GMB工会指责Burton's Biscuits（也制造马里兰州的饼干）提供了“侮辱性”的薪水，使工人受到“侮辱”。
伯顿饼干公司的一位发言人说，它对GMB要求加薪7％的要求感到“震惊”，但渴望恢复谈判。
爱丁堡工厂雇用了400多名工人，每天生产约750万饼干。
伯顿公司（Burtons）也根据永久许可证生产吉百利饼干，该公司在英国拥有3个工厂，雇用2200名工人。

The GMB union accused Burton's Biscuits, which also makes Maryland cookies, of making a "derisory" pay offer that had "insulted" workers.
A Burton's Biscuits spokesman said it was "shocked" at GMB's request for a 7% pay rise but keen to resume talks.
More than 400 workers are employed at its Edinburgh factory, which makes around 7.5 million biscuits a day.
Burtons, which also makes Cadbury biscuits under a perpetual licence, has three sites in the UK employing 2,200 workers.
