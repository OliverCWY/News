美国组织黑人中国核心小组（Black China Caucus）自称为“在中国空间扩大黑人声音”，也在推特上为巴顿辩护。

"Professor Greg Patton repeated several times a Chinese word that sounds very similar to a vile racial slur in English," said Garrett in the email.
"We acknowledge the historical, cultural and harmful impact of racist language," said USC Marshall in a statement.
The Black China Caucus, an American organization that describes itself as "amplifying Black voices in the China space," also defended Patton on Twitter.

这位名叫“珍妮”（Jeanne）的女人也到Twitter指责该博物馆-世界上一些最著名的裸体绘画所在地-“双重标准”后，巴黎奥赛博物馆在推特上表示遗憾。
珍妮分享了当日拍摄的自己的照片，她说，在法国首都的一个温暖的日子里，她最初与朋友一起参观奥赛博物馆时被拒绝入境。
在询问了为什么不允许她进入后，博物馆的工作人员显然指着她的乳沟，使她“极度尴尬”。
珍妮继续批评博物馆的工作人员“基于乳沟进行歧视”。
奥赛博物馆在Twitter上的道歉声明中说，已经与珍妮取得了联系。

The Musee d'Orsay in Paris tweeted its regrets after the woman, identified only as "Jeanne," also took to Twitter to accuse the museum -- home to some of the world's most famous nude paintings -- of "double standards."
Jeanne, who shared an image of herself taken on the same day, says she was initially denied entry while visiting Musee d'Orsay with a friend during a warm day in the French capital.
After questioning why she wasn't allowed inside, the museum's staff apparently pointed to her cleavage, leaving her "excruciatingly embarrassed."
Jeanne went on to criticize the museum's staff for "discriminating on the basis of cleavage."
In its apology, posted on Twitter , Musee d'Orsay said it had reached out to Jeanne.

It is not the first time in South Africa where marketing campaigns have resulted in a backlash against the brand.

每个人都提供一个令人印象深刻的快照，说明在冠状病毒时代，工作场所变得多么紧张。
但是，提倡工人的人说，由于很难证明某人在某个位置感染了病毒，这将给原告增加本已很重的举证责任。
莫妮卡·蒙哥马利（Monica Montgomery）在4月24日测试为阳性；投诉称，她的女儿Nya Patton两天前检测出阳性。

Four of the six workers, the records say, later also tested positive -- including both Montgomery and Patton, who was pregnant.
Pro-business groups have sounded alarms about an "epidemic of lawsuits"; worker advocacy groups say the suits are often the best way to demand accountability.
Each one offers a telling snapshot of just how fraught the workplace has become in the age of the coronavirus.
But advocates for workers say this would raise an already high burden of proof for plaintiffs, due to the difficulty of proving that a person contracted a virus at a certain location.
Monica Montgomery tested positive on April 24; her daughter, Nya Patton, had tested positive two days earlier, according to the complaint.

它被归类为“ D色”，是白色钻石的最高等级，并且在内部和外部都被认为是“无瑕疵”，从而跻身于世界上化学性质最纯净，透明和对称的钻石之中。
根据苏富比拍卖行的说法，这颗钻石将只是在拍卖会上出售的大小和质量可比的第八颗白钻。
据苏富比拍卖行称，此前仅有七枚D色无瑕（或内部无瑕）钻石重达100克拉以上。
竞标将从9月15日开始在线拍卖，最终拍卖将于10月5日在香港进行现场拍卖。
虽然白色钻石可以在拍卖会上吸引巨大的竞标，但近年来，粉色和蓝色品种的成交额甚至更高。

It has been classified as "D color," the highest grading for a white diamond, and is considered to be internally and externally "flawless," placing it among the world's most chemically pure, transparent and symmetrical diamonds.

Bidding will open online from September 15, with the sale concluding at a live auction in Hong Kong on October 5.
While white diamonds can attract huge bids at auction, pink and blue varieties have achieved even larger sums in recent years.

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-当通过吸引人的飞机制服寻求公众的关注时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常是白色，但并不总是白色（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板可以应用最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，合并和收购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
