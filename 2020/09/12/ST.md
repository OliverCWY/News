东京-即将离任的日本首相安倍晋三（Shinzo Abe）为在周五（9月11日）获得对敌方导弹基地的第一次打击能力铺平了道路，但表示将由新政府采取行动。
安倍晋三的讲话特别将矛头指向了朝鲜，“朝鲜拥有数百枚弹道导弹，其中有日本在射程之内”，这是迫在眉睫的威胁。
他进一步警告说，朝鲜已经成功地使可安装在这些弹道导弹上的核弹头小型化。
但是神户大学安全专家Tosh Minohara认为，单从北韩出来只是为了使该战略在政治上更加正确。
他说：“我们不应该低估朝鲜，但中国才是真正的原因。”国防部长河野太郎周三表示，中国对日本构成了安全威胁。

TOKYO - Outgoing Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe paved the way for the acquisition of first-strike capability on enemy missile bases on Friday (Sept 11), but said it will be up to the new government to follow through.
Mr Abe’s statement specifically pointed the finger at North Korea, with “its arsenal of several hundred ballistic missiles that have Japan within range” an imminent threat.
He further warned that North Korea has succeeded in miniaturising nuclear warheads that can be mounted on these ballistic missiles.
But Kobe University security expert Tosh Minohara believes that the singling out of North Korea is but to make the strategy more politically correct.
He said: “We should not underestimate North Korea but China is the real reason.”On Wednesday, Defence Minister Taro Kono said China poses a security threat to Japan.

北京-1950年3月，共产党击败国民党军队并赢得了中国内战，六个月后，毛泽东在刚刚起步的中华人民共和国发起了第一场政治运动，以“镇压反革命分子”。
在为巩固中国共产党执政的三年运动期间，至少有260万人被国民党残余，地主和土匪围困，其中一半被送往劳改营。

BEIJING - In March 1950, six months after the Communists defeated Kuomintang (KMT) troops and won the Chinese civil war, Mao Zedong launched the first political campaign in the fledgling People's Republic of China to "suppress counter-revolutionaries".
During the three-year campaign to consolidate the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) hold on power, at least 2.6 million people comprising of KMT remnants, landlords and bandits were rounded up and half that number were sent to labour camps.

总理穆希丁·亚辛（Muhyiddin Yassin）稳固担任七个月大龄的佩里卡丹国家（PN）政府首脑，至少在他要求举行预期的大选之前，反对派可能由沙巴现任首席部长沙菲·阿普达尔（Shafie Apdal）领导。

Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin is secure as head of the seven-month-old Perikatan Nasional (PN) government, at least until he calls for an expected snap election, where the opposition could be led by Sabah's incumbent Chief Minister Shafie Apdal.

新加坡-新加坡航空（SIA）计划在下个月启动从樟宜机场起飞并降落的无目的地航班，以使处于困境的业务得到提升。
消息人士告诉《海峡时报》，这家国家航空公司正在努力在10月底前为国内乘客推出这种选择，这种航班被称为“无处飞行”。
与其他航空公司一样，新航也饱受Covid-19的影响。
尽管新航没有提供有关拟议的无目的地航班的任何详细信息，但伍德先生表示，他已经设想了针对此类无目的地航班的捆绑包。
他的公司对308人进行了一项调查，发现75％的人愿意为无人飞行的航班付费。

SINGAPORE - Singapore Airlines (SIA) is looking to launch no-destination flights that will depart from and land in Changi Airport next month, in a bid to give its ailing business a lift.
Sources told The Straits Times that the national carrier is working towards launching this option for domestic passengers - dubbed "flights to nowhere" - by end-October.
Like other airlines, SIA has been badly battered by the fallout from Covid-19.
While SIA did not provide any details on its proposed flights to nowhere, Mr Wood said he had envisioned a bundle package for such no-destination flights.
A survey of 308 people that his firm conducted found 75 per cent were willing to pay for flights to nowhere.
