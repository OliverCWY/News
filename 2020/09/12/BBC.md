特朗普先生在一月份提出了他的中东和平计划，旨在解决以巴冲突，他帮助达成了两项协议。
这将使特朗普能够将注意力转移到他未能实现的“世纪交易”上：以巴和平。
特朗普先生在推特上写道，并补充说：“我们的两个伟大的朋友以色列和巴林王国同意和平协议。”
总统还在推特上发布了特朗普，内塔尼亚胡和巴林国王哈马德·本·伊萨·本·萨勒曼·哈利法三位领导人之间的联合声明。
特朗普将于下周二在华盛顿白宫举行仪式，正式签署以色列-阿联酋协定。

Mr Trump, who presented his Middle East peace plan in January aimed at resolving the Israel-Palestinian conflict, helped broker both accords.
This will allow Mr Trump to deflect attention from the "Deal of the Century" that he failed to achieve: Israeli-Palestinian peace.
Mr Trump wrote on Twitter, adding: "Our two GREAT friends Israel and the Kingdom of Bahrain agree to a Peace Deal."
The president also posted on Twitter a copy of a joint statement between the three leaders - Mr Trump, Mr Netanyahu and Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa bin Salman al-Khalifa.
Mr Trump is due to host a ceremony at the White House in Washington next Tuesday for the official signing of the Israel-UAE agreement.

州长凯特·布朗（Kate Brown）说，由于野火继续席卷美国西部，俄勒冈州数十人失踪。
仅俄勒冈州就有成千上万的人因致命的地狱而流离失所。
戈夫·布朗周五在接受记者采访时说：“许多俄勒冈人现在正在遭受痛苦，无论他们是流离失所者，还是担心自己的家人和社区，同时又看着我们美丽的州被烧毁。”
“让我向您保证，我们有俄勒冈国民警卫队和俄勒冈州警察监视局势并防止掠夺。”
与俄勒冈州一起，加利福尼亚州和华盛顿州是受影响最严重的州。

Tens of thousands of people in Oregon alone have been displaced by the deadly infernos.
"Many Oregonians are suffering right now, whether displaced themselves or worried about their families and communities while watching our beautiful state burn," Gov Brown told reporters on Friday.
"Let me assure you that we have the Oregon National Guard and Oregon State Police monitoring the situation and preventing looting."
Along with Oregon, California and Washington state are the worst affected states.

在1980年代，埃及的尼罗河三角洲部分地区不再繁荣。
尽管它靠近干旱的沙漠，但它以肥沃而闻名，数千年来一直是可靠的耕种之地。
它的生产力使古埃及人将精力从自给自足的耕作转移到发展强大的文明，这种文明产生了如此的文化壮举，使他们在数千年后闻名世界。
然而，尽管在过去的千年中为该地区的社区提供了支持，但在短短的十年左右的时间里，生育力就消失了。

In the 1980s parts of the Nile Delta in Egypt stopped flourishing.
Famed for its fertility, it had been a reliable place to farm for thousands of years despite its proximity to the arid desert.
Its productivity had allowed the ancient Egyptians to divert their energies from subsistence farming to developing a powerful civilisation that produced such cultural feats that they are famed around the world thousands of years later.
Yet, despite supporting communities in the region over the millennia, in the space of just 10 years or so, that fecundity faded.

这项活动在Instagram帖子中得到了体现，Lululemon建议其他帐户关注，包括研讨会的主持人Rebby Kern。
传统基金会智囊团的法学研究员艾米·斯怀特（Amy Swearer）指出：“卢卢蒙（Lululemon）是资本主义。
Lululemon的瑜伽裤售价150美元，您是在告诉我抵抗资本主义？”
今年早些时候，在一名员工在社交媒体上发布了一件在中国引起愤怒的T恤设计后，它也道歉。

The event was featured in an Instagram post in which Lululemon recommended other accounts to follow, including the host of the workshop, Rebby Kern.
Amy Swearer, a legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation think tank, noted: "Lululemon IS capitalism.
Lululemon's yoga pants cost $150 and you are telling me to resist capitalism?"
Earlier this year, it also apologised after one of its employees posted a T-shirt design on social media that caused outrage in China.

自3月份以来，R值首次提高到1到1.2之间。
上周五，英国每天确认的新病毒病例增加至3,539，比前一天增加了600多。
如果R数大于1（如现在），则被感染的人数正在增加，数字越高表示病例的繁殖速度越快。
但是现在R数自3月份以来首次超过1的关键水平，并且有大量数据表明病例再次增加。
锁定前，R数约为3，案件每三到四天翻一番。

The R number was raised to between 1 and 1.2 for the first time since March.
The number of new daily confirmed UK cases of the virus rose to 3,539 on Friday - an increase of more than 600 on the previous day.
If the R number is higher than one - as now - the numbers infected are growing, with higher numbers indicating that cases are multiplying more quickly.
But now the R number has gone above the crucial level of 1 for the first time since March and is backed up by reams of data showing cases are growing again.
Pre-lockdown, the R number was around three and cases were doubling every three to four days.

美国政府的巨额支出用于缓解冠状病毒，这使美国的预算赤字达到了创纪录的逾30亿美元（合2.3亿英镑）。
甚至在大流行爆发之前，美国今年的赤字就已经超过了10亿美元，按历史标准计算，这是很大的。
美国国会预算办公室本月预测，美国全年赤字可能达到33亿美元，是去年缺口的三倍多。
联邦政府的财政年度在9月结束。
该计划未能推进，民主党人表示，该计划与他们支持的逾3千亿美元的救济金相差甚远。

Image copyright Getty ImagesThe US budget deficit has hit a record high of more than $3tn (£2.3tn), driven by the government's massive spending on coronavirus relief.
Even before the pandemic, the US was on track to run a deficit of more than $1tn this year - large by historic standards.
The Congressional Budget Office this month predicted that the US was likely to run a full-year deficit of $3.3tn, more than triple the shortfall recorded last year.
The federal government's financial year ends in September.
The plan failed to advance, with Democrats saying it fell far short of the more than $3tn in relief they support.

Dr Schmidt, who is currently the Chair of the US Department of Defense's innovation board, said he thinks the US is still ahead of China in tech innovation, for now.
This R&D is helping Chinese tech firms get ahead in key areas like artificial intelligence and 5G.
This week it revoked the visas of 1,000 Chinese students it claims have military links and accused Chinese tech firms of acting as agents for the Chinese Communist Party - claims Beijing and these companies reject.
The Trump administration has also taken steps to block Chinese tech firms like Huawei and Chinese apps including TikTok and WeChat, saying they pose threats to national security.

批评人士说，尽管这笔交易可能具有象征意义，但只会使英国的国内生产总值（GDP）提高0.07％，而这笔交易的一部分可能与欧盟损失。
英国贸易部声明说，日产和日立等在英国的主要日本投资者将受益于对来自日本的零部件降低的关税以及简化的监管程序。
但最终，该交易很大程度上反映了欧盟与日本之间已经存在的协议。
据估计，这两个国家在贸易总额预计增加150亿英镑中所占的份额最大，占80％。

Critics said while the deal may be of symbolic importance it would boost UK GDP by only 0.07%, a fraction of the trade that could be lost with the EU.
Major Japanese investors in the UK such as Nissan and Hitachi would benefit from reduced tariffs on parts coming from Japan and streamlined regulatory procedures, the UK's trade department statement said.
But ultimately, this deal largely mirrors the agreement which already exists between the EU and Japan.
It stands to get the lions share, 80%, of the total estimated £15bn boost to trade for both countries.
