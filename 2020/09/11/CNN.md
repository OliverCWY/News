然后汉尼蒂直接问特朗普，为什么他决定参加伍德沃德的书。
特朗普对此说（this是我的）：“首先，在伍德沃德书上，在书本上，他打电话给他。
可能几乎肯定不会阅读，因为我没有时间阅读。”
然后是特朗普的争执：他“大概，几乎肯定”不会读伍德沃德的《愤怒》，因为他没有“读时间”。
然而，他说他不会读伍德沃德的书，因为他没有时间！

Then Hannity asked Trump directly why he decided to participate in the Woodward book.
To which Trump said this (bolding is mine):"Well, first of all, on the Woodward book, on the book itself, he called.
Probably, almost definitely won't read it, because I don't have time to read it."
Then there's this Trump contention: He "probably, almost definitely" won't read Woodward's "Rage" because he doesn't "have time to read it."
And yet, he says he won't read the Woodward book because he doesn't have the time\!

特朗普政府几乎不能以匿名采购为由驳回任何此类指控。
许多人继续为伍德沃德的书录制唱片。
在CNN上，伍德沃德的前水门合作伙伴卡尔·伯恩斯坦（Carl Bernstein）称特朗普的行动“是一种杀人过失”。
他说直到5月份他才能确定特朗普的言论是基于可靠的信息。
如果伍德沃德在二月或三月对特朗普对病毒的两方面反应，是否会产生重大变化？

And almost none of it can be dismissed by the Trump administration on the grounds of anonymous sourcing.
Many people went on the record for Woodward's book.
On CNN, Woodward's former Watergate partner, Carl Bernstein, called Trump's action's "a kind of homicidal negligence."
He said it wasn't until May that he was certain that Trump's comments were based on reliable information.
Would it have made a significant difference if Woodward came forward with Trump's two-faced reaction to the virus in February or March?

（CNN）美国众议院议长南希·佩洛西（Nancy Pelosi）警告，如果英国采取任何行动破坏在数十年暴力之后为北爱尔兰带来和平的条约，将无法与美国达成贸易协议。 。
佩洛西发表上述评论之前，英国表示，如果未达成贸易协议，它将立法废除与欧盟的部分离婚协议。
英国政府声称，其《内部市场法案》旨在确保在无协议退欧的情况下，英国四个国家之间的贸易不受限制。
美国高层民主党人对此的看法并不太好，他们担心这会破坏1998年的耶稣受难日协议，该协议在经历了数十年的宗派冲突后为北爱尔兰带来了和平。
佩洛西在周三的一份声明中说：“如果英国违反国际条约，而英国退欧破坏了耶稣受难日协议，那么美英贸易协定绝对不会通过国会。”

(CNN) Rep. Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, has warned that Britain will be unable to secure a trade deal with the US if it does anything to undermine the treaty that brought peace to Northern Ireland after decades of violence.
Pelosi's comments came after the UK said it would legislate to override parts of the divorce deal with the European Union in the event that a trade agreement isn't reached.
The UK government claims that its Internal Market Bill is designed to ensure that trade between the four nations of the United Kingdom would remain unfettered in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
That did not go down well among top Democrats in the US, who fear it could undermine the 1998 Good Friday agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland after decades of sectarian conflict.
"If the UK violates that international treaty and Brexit undermines the Good Friday accord, there will be absolutely no chance of a US-UK trade agreement passing the Congress," Pelosi said in a statement on Wednesday.

伊维萨岛旅游主管胡安·米格尔·科斯塔说：“我们岛上现在根本没有旅游。”
科斯塔说，像圣安东尼奥这样的地区依赖英国的旅游业。
如果您是一个有两个孩子的家庭，您可以毫无问题地来到伊维萨岛。
他承认，他担心Covid-19时代岛上的大型俱乐部的未来-他担心巴利阿里群岛的旅游状况更为普遍。

(CNN) — Hundreds of sweaty clubbers are crammed onto at the Glitterbox dance floor, soaking up the grooves as one of Ibiza's biggest party nights gets into full swing.
"There's no tourism at all, now, on our island," says Juan Miguel Costa, Ibiza's tourism director.
Areas like San Antonio, depend on British tourism, says Costa.
If you are a family with two kids, you can come to Ibiza without any problem [...] It's not a full party island.
He admits he's concerned about the future of the island's big clubs in the age of Covid-19 -- he's worried about the Balearic Islands tourism situation more generally.

（CNN）-美国计划停止将某些国家/地区的国际航班限制在15个机场，并通过加强检查的方式将其转移到其他国家。
疾病预防控制中心说，筛查症状并没有太大帮助，因为很多人没有症状。
“没有症状或尚未出现感染症状的乘客可能会传播病毒。
因此，疾病预防控制中心正在改变其战略，并优先考虑其他公共卫生措施，以减少与旅行有关的疾病传播的风险。”
疾病预防控制中心说，这些措施将包括“对旅客的出发前，飞行中和到达后的健康教育；机场对疾病的强烈反应；使用电子方式自愿收集旅客的联系信息。”

(CNN) — The United States plans to stop limiting international arrivals from certain countries to 15 airports and funneling them through enhanced screening.
Screening for symptoms doesn't really help much because so many people do not have symptoms, the CDC said.
"Transmission of the virus may occur from passengers who have no symptoms or who have not yet developed symptoms of infection.
Therefore, CDC is shifting its strategy and prioritizing other public health measures to reduce the risk of travel-related disease transmission," the agency said.
These will include "pre-departure, in-flight, and post-arrival health education for passengers; robust illness response at airports; voluntary collection of contact information from passengers using electronic means," the CDC said.

（CNN）一项新的研究表明，美国确诊的冠状病毒病例数被大大低估了，主要是因为缺乏检测。
这份发表在《自然通讯》杂志上的报告说，到4月18日，美国可能已经发生了640万例Covid-19病例。
根据约翰·霍普金斯大学的数据，截至周三，已有超过630万例冠状病毒病例报告，死亡190,763人死亡。
研究小组写道：“根据最近和宣布的预期市场准入，到2020年10月，即时医疗点测试将上升到每月至少7000万次测试。”
到一月，美国每月可能达到近2亿次测试。

(CNN) The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US were greatly undercounted, mostly because of a lack of testing, a new study shows.

As of Wednesday, more than 6.3 million coronavirus cases have been reported and 190,763 people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.
"By October 2020, based on recent and announced expected market entry, point-of-care tests will rise to at least 70 million tests per month," the team wrote.
By January, the US could reach nearly 200 million tests monthly.

国际航空运输协会总干事兼首席执行官亚历山大·德·朱尼亚克（Alexandre de Juniac）在一份声明中说：“安全交付Covid-19疫苗将是全球航空货运业的世纪使命。”
国际航空运输协会（IATA）指出，航空货运业长期以来在疫苗分配中发挥了重要作用，提供了完善的对时间和温度敏感的系统，这对于快速有效地运输Covid-19疫苗至关重要。
货机747的最新版本基于旅客模型747-8。
“航空货运解决方案对全球卫生服务的重要性从未像现在这样重要。
世界上约有一半的航空货运是由客机运输的，货物是用行李放在飞机的腹部。

"Safely delivering Covid-19 vaccines will be the mission of the century for the global air cargo industry," said IATA's director general and CEO, Alexandre de Juniac, in a statement.
The air cargo industry has long played an important role in vaccine distribution, providing well-established time- and temperature-sensitive systems -- which will be crucial to the quick and efficient transport of Covid-19 vaccines, notes IATA.
The newest version of the cargo 747 is based on the passenger model, the 747-8.
"Air cargo solutions have never been more important than they are now to global health services.

（CNN）事实证明，这些年来，巴黎希尔顿一直在玩巴黎希尔顿。
希尔顿在9月14日上映的新YouTube原创纪录片《这就是巴黎》中谈到了创造“巴黎希尔顿”这一角色，部分目的是为了应对青少年时期的创伤。我已经看过了，必须承认看到社交名流的这一面既令人耳目一新，又很奇怪。
“这就是巴黎”探讨了希尔顿的名声和无尽的狗仔队摄影作品。
希尔顿现年39岁，是一位成功的企业家，自从她初露头角以来，她已经发展壮大，流行文化也随之发展。
希尔顿：自拍：在2013年牛津英语词典的在线版本中包含该词之前，希尔顿就完善了自画像的艺术。

(CNN) Turns out that all these years, Paris Hilton has been playing Paris Hilton.
In her new YouTube Originals documentary, "This Is Paris," which debuts on September 14, Hilton talks about creating the character of "Paris Hilton," in part, to deal with a trauma from her teen yearsI've watched it, and I have to admit that it was both refreshing and odd to see this side of the socialite.
"This Is Paris" explores what was really going on with Hilton beyond the fame and endless paparazzi photographs.
Now 39 and a successful entrepreneur, Hilton has evolved and so has popular culture since she first burst onto the scene.
Hilton for:Selfies: Well before the word was included in the online version of the Oxford English Dictionary in 2013, Hilton had perfected the art of the self-portrait.

每个地点都是独一无二的，但斯坦因茨注意到了一个共同的主题-人类正在改变地球。
在2018年《纽约时报》（New York Times）杂志派遣他到各个大洲记录气候变化之后，斯坦梅茨决定整理一本书，收集他整个职业生涯的图像。
“人类星球”记载了我们对环境的影响以及为保护环境而提出的解决方案。
偶然的环保主义者这种鸟瞰世界使Steinmetz能够见证并记录人类改变地球的方式。
这位摄影师说他不打算记录气候变化，但他的工作档案使人类的足迹不可否认。

Each location was unique, but the Steinmetz noticed a common theme -- humans were changing the planet.
After a 2018 New York Times Magazine assignment that sent him to every continent to document climate change, Steinmetz decided to put together a book, collecting images spanning his whole career.
"Human Planet" chronicles our impact on the environment and the solutions we have come up with to try to save it.
The accidental environmentalistThis bird's-eye view of the world allowed Steinmetz to witness -- and document -- the ways humans have changed the planet.
The photographer says he didn't intend to document climate change, but his archive of work made humanity's footprint undeniable.

## 画飞机：为什么每一层都很重要

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-通过吸引人的飞机制服吸引公众注意力时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常为白色，但并非总是如此（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板应用了最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，合并和收购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
