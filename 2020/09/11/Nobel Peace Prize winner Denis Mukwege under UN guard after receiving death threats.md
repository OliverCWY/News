(CNN) The UN has redeployed troops to guard Nobel Peace Prize winner Denis Mukwege after he received death threats for demanding justice for serious crimes committed in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the agency said.

The gynecologist's career has spanned more than 20 years, during which time he has treated tens of thousands of rape victims.

He was a joint winner of the Nobel peace prize in 2018 alongside Nadia Murad for their efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war and armed conflict.

Death threats

The UN said the recent threats against Dr. Mukwege via social media and in direct phone calls to him and his family "followed his condemnation of the continued killing of civilians in eastern DRC and his renewed calls for accountability for human rights violations and abuses."
