欧盟要求英国削减计划“在月底前改变鲍里斯·约翰逊的英国脱欧协议”，否则可能危及贸易谈判。
英国外交大臣弗罗斯特（David Frost）表示，在自由贸易协定方面仍存在“重大”分歧，但下周在布鲁塞尔将继续进行讨论。
如果英国和欧盟无法达成贸易协议，它将赋予英国部长修改或“废止”与货物运输有关的规则的权力，这些规则将从1月1日起生效。
本质上说，除非英国退缩，否则没有进行贸易谈判的机会，因此也没有达成交易的机会。
与此同时，关于英国脱欧后贸易协议的最新一轮正式谈判于周四在伦敦结束。

His UK counterpart David Frost said "significant" differences remained over a free trade deal, but added discussions would continue in Brussels next week.
It gives UK ministers powers to modify or "disapply" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January, if the UK and EU are unable to strike a trade deal.
Essentially saying that there's no chance of trade talks, and hence no chance of a deal, unless the UK backs down.
Meanwhile, the latest round of formal talks over a post-Brexit trade deal concluded in London on Thursday.

微软表示，与俄罗斯，中国和伊朗有联系的黑客正在试图监视与美国2020年总统大选有关的人和团体。
这家科技公司表示，入侵了2016年民主党竞选活动的俄罗斯集团再次涉嫌网络攻击。
微软在一份声明中说，Strontium组织的俄罗斯黑客已经将200多个组织作为攻击目标，其中许多组织与美国政党-共和党和民主党都有联系。
该公司表示，中国黑客已针对与拜登竞选活动有关的个人发动了攻击，而伊朗黑客则继续针对与特朗普竞选活动有关的人进行攻击。
特别顾问罗伯特·穆勒（Robert Mueller）的调查发现，俄罗斯黑客可以访问民主党全国委员会系统以及克林顿竞选主席约翰·波德斯塔（John Podesta）的个人电子邮件。

The Russian group which hacked the 2016 Democratic campaign is again involved in cyber-attacks, said the tech firm.
Russian hackers from the Strontium group have targeted more than 200 organisations, many of which are linked to US political parties - both Republicans and Democrats, Microsoft said in a statement.
The firm said Chinese hackers had launched attacks targeting individuals connected to Mr Biden's campaign, while Iranian hackers had continued efforts targeting people associated with the Trump campaign.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation found Russian hackers gained access to Democratic National Committee systems as well as Clinton campaign chair John Podesta's personal email.

今年早些时候，当Covid-19大流行迫使全球封锁时，一个积极的（甚至是暂时的）好处是减少了室外空气污染。
从美国到中国，污染水平显着下降。
然而，随着国家的开放，污染水平已反弹至大流行前水平。
但是，这种对室外空气污染的关注忽视了一个简单的事实–我们暴露在空气污染中的大多数实际上发生在室内。
“但是绝大多数人受到的污染都发生在室内。”

When the Covid-19 pandemic forced global lockdowns earlier this year, one positive – if temporary – upside was a reduction in outdoor air pollution.
From the US to China, pollution levels dropped significantly.
As countries have opened back up, however, pollution levels have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels.
But this focus on outdoor air pollution overlooks a simple fact – most of our exposure to air pollution actually happens indoors.
"But the vast majority of people’s exposure to pollution happens indoors."
