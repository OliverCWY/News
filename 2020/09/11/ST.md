新加坡-新加坡航空（SIA）集团正因Covid-19辐射事件而裁员。
该航空公司在一份声明中说：“新加坡航空公司（SIA）今天宣布了一项艰难的决定，即削减其各航空公司约4,300个职位。

在2003年爆发的严重急性呼吸系统综合症高峰期-这次灾难没有现在的大流行那么严重-SIA裁员了数百名工作人员，包括飞行员和机组人员。
她说：“遗憾的是，这些努力不足以完全避免这种情况并克服Covid-19大流行的严重性和长期影响。”

The airline said in a statement: "The Singapore Airlines (SIA) Group today announced the difficult decision to cut around 4,300 positions across its airlines.

At the height of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003 - which was less devastating than the current pandemic - SIA retrenched several hundred staff, including pilots and cabin crew.
“Regrettably, these efforts were insufficient to avoid it completely and overcome the severity and prolonged impact of the Covid-19 pandemic,” she said.

74岁的廖先生在周四（9月10日）的一份声明中表示，他已决定从这些职位上退休。
上周五，大法官陈成安（Chan Seng Onn）宣判廖氏犹太人的前印度尼西亚女仆帕提·利雅妮（Parti Liyani）从廖氏和他的家人那里偷窃。
46岁的Parti女士曾在2007年至2016年期间为Liew家族工作，她被指控偷走了价值超过34,000美元的物品。
周二，Parti女士被免除第五项欺诈性拥有财产的指控，使她免于所有刑事指控。
Liyani女士随后被警察逮捕，后来被检察官指控。”

In a statement on Thursday (Sept 10), Mr Liew, 74, said he had decided to bring forward his retirement from these roles.
Last Friday, Justice Chan Seng Onn acquitted the Liews' former Indonesian maid Parti Liyani of stealing from Mr Liew and his family.
Ms Parti, 46, who worked for the Liew family from 2007 to 2016, had been accused of stealing over $34,000 worth of items.
On Tuesday, Ms Parti was cleared of a fifth charge of fraudulent possession of property, making her free of all criminal charges.
Ms Liyani was subsequently arrested by the police, and later, charged by the Public Prosecutor," he added.

北京（法新社）-中国在美国确认已根据唐纳德·特朗普总统的一项命令撤销了1000多名中国学生的签证之后，指控华盛顿“政治迫害和种族歧视”，该指控是对美国进行间谍活动的。
中国外交部周四作出反击，称美国“应立即停止以各种借口无故限制和压制在美中国学生”。
这严重侵犯了这些中国学生的人权。”外交部发言人赵立建在一次新闻发布会上说。
国务院发言人说：“根据这项声明被取消资格的高风险研究生和研究学者，只占来美国的中国学生和学者总数的一小部分。”
美国官员指责中国试图窃取大学对Covid-19的研究，这是特朗普政府6月关闭中国驻休斯敦领事馆的原因。

BEIJING (AFP) - China accused Washington of “political persecution and racial discrimination” on Thursday (Sept 10), after the US confirmed it had revoked the visas of more than 1,000 Chinese students under an order by President Donald Trump that accused some of espionage.
China’s Foreign Ministry hit back on Thursday, saying the US should “immediately stop using all kinds of pretexts to restrict and suppress Chinese students in the US for no reason”.
It seriously violates the human rights of these Chinese students,” said Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian at a press conference.
“The high-risk graduate students and research scholars made ineligible under this proclamation represent a small subset of the total number of Chinese students and scholars coming to the United States,” a State Department spokeswoman said.
US officials accuse China of seeking to steal university research into Covid-19, a reason cited for the Trump administration’s closing of China’s consulate in Houston in June.

## 印度的GST征收陷入困境，引发各州与联邦政府之间的争执

现在，依赖州和联邦政府之间合作的税收因冠状病毒大流行和低消费税征收而陷入麻烦，导致收入短缺2.35万亿卢比（437亿新元）。
财政部长尼尔玛拉·西塔拉曼（Nirmala Sitharaman）上月底宣布，联邦政府将无法向各州提供赔偿。
他在信中写道：“人们认为，通过商品及服务税的借款将商品及服务税的赔偿义务转移给各州，并不符合中央（联邦政府）与各州之间达成的谅解精神。”
根据《商品及服务税法》（GST），保证各州在头五年的收入损失得到全额赔偿。
GST委员会由GST控制，并有联邦和州代表，将于9月19日开会。

Now, the tax, dependent on cooperation between states and the federal government, has run into trouble with the coronavirus pandemic and low GST collections resulting in a revenue shortfall of 2.35 trillion rupees (S$43.7 billion).
Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced late last month that the federal government would be unable to compensate states.
"It is felt that transferring the obligation of GST compensation to the states through their borrowing is not in accordance with the spirit of understanding reached between the centre (federal government) and the states," he wrote in the letter.
Under the GST Act, states were guaranteed full compensation for any revenue loss in the first five years.
The GST council, which controls GST and has federal and state representatives, is set to meet on Sept 19.

Sabah Bersatu负责人Hajiji Noor声称PN不知道重叠之处，因为“我还没有其他各方的候选人名单”。
虽然州选举不会直接影响组成马来西亚联邦政府的联盟，但这是选民忠诚度的领头羊。
穆萨（Musa）担任沙巴总理长达15年之久，直到巫统领导的国阵（BN）于2018年被罢免。
PKR州长克里斯蒂娜·廖（Christina Liew）说：“该决定得到了PKR总统和该党秘书长（总部）的确认和认可，以支持当地领导人的利益，以符合沙巴的最大利益。”
沙巴州民意调查是在穆萨（Musa）先生将叛逃的集会人员拉到自己的营地，从而剥夺了沙菲（Shafie）的政府多数后触发的。

Sabah Bersatu chief Hajiji Noor claimed PN was not aware of the overlaps as "I don't have the candidate list from other parties yet".
While the state election does not directly affect which coalition forms Malaysia’s federal government, it is a bellwether of where voter loyalties lie.
Mr Musa was Sabah's chief minister for 15 years until the Umno-led Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition was ousted in 2018.
"The decision was confirmed and endorsed by the President of PKR and the party’s Secretary-General (Headquarters) to support the decision of the local leaders in the best interests of Sabah," state PKR chief Christina Liew said.
The Sabah state poll was triggered after Mr Musa drew defecting assemblymen to his camp, depriving Mr Shafie's administration of a majority.

雅加达-雅加达州长安妮丝·巴斯维丹（Anies Baswedan）周三（9月9日）表示，随着Covid-19案件继续激增，印尼首都将采取严格的限制性措施。
阿尼斯先生补充说，雅加达市政府管理的所有娱乐中心将关闭。
雅加达（Jakarta）是一个拥有1000万人口的城市，它是该国Covid-19疫情的第一个震中，因此具有可疑之处。
它在周三报告了1004例新病例，使该市的总数达到49397例。
雅加达省长说：“面对紧急情况，雅加达除了尽快拉动紧急刹车外别无选择。”

JAKARTA - Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan on Wednesday (Sept 9) said that strict restrictive measures would be reimposed in the Indonesian capital as Covid-19 cases continued to surge.
Mr Anies added that all entertainment centres managed by the Jakarta city administration would be closed.
A city of 10 million, Jakarta has the dubious distinction of being the first epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak in the country.
It reported 1,004 fresh cases on Wednesday, bringing the total number of cases in the city to 49,397.
“Faced with the emergency situation, Jakarta doesn’t have any choice other than pulling the emergency brake as soon as possible,” the governor said.

欧盟委员会主席乌尔苏拉·冯·德·莱恩（Ursula von der Leyen）说，她“非常关注”，并警告约翰逊先生的举动“破坏了信任”。
保守党的许多议员和高官也对约翰逊准备违反国际法的担忧表示担忧。
约翰逊先生的办公室表示，拟议中的法律创建了一个“安全网”，并消除了退出协议中的“歧义”。
根据欧盟准备并分发给成员国的工作文件草案，这将是退出协议的“明显违反实质性规定”。
该文件的结论是，违反这些义务“将为退出协议下可提供的法律补救措施开辟道路”。

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she is "very concerned" and warned that Mr Johnson's move "undermines trust".
A number of Conservative lawmakers and grandees have also weighed in with their concerns over Mr Johnson's preparedness to break international law.
Mr Johnson's office said the proposed law creates a "safety net" and removes "ambiguities" in the text of the withdrawal agreement.
That would be a "clear breach of substantive provisions" of the withdrawal agreement, according to the draft working paper prepared by the EU and circulated to member states.
The document concludes that a breach of those obligations "would open the way to the legal remedies available under the withdrawal agreement."

人口约112万人的米佐拉姆邦（Mizoram）在1300多次冠状病毒感染中没有记录到单例死亡。
这一成功归因于由米佐民族阵线领导的州政府与当地社区成员之间的有效合作。
“我们取得的成就是国家各方面齐心协力的结果，无论是政府，非政府组织（NGO）还是教会组织，” Covid发言人兼州节点官员Pachuau Lalmalsawma博士-19日告诉《海峡时报》。
鉴于该州医疗基础设施不足以及道路连通性差，这种情况将是灾难性的。
在星期四（9月10日），米佐拉姆邦记录了141例新病例，这是该州一天中登记的确诊感染人数最多的一次。

Mizoram, with a population of around 1.12 million, has not recorded a single death among more than 1,300 coronavirus infections.
This success has been attributed to an effective partnership between the state government, which is led by the Mizo National Front, and local community members.
"What we have achieved is the result of a concerted effort from all corners of the state, whether it is governmental, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) or church-based organisations," Dr Pachuau Lalmalsawma, the spokesman and state nodal officer for Covid-19, told The Straits Times.
Such a scenario would be devastating, given the inadequate medical infrastructure as well as poor road connectivity in the state.
On Thursday (Sept 10), Mizoram recorded 141 new cases, which is the highest number of confirmed infections registered in a single day in the state.
