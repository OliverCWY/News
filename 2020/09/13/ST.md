这些会议主要受美中紧张局势的影响，特别是围绕有争议的南中国海的紧张局势。
庞培说：“面对中国共产党的不断升级的侵略和对主权国家自由选择能力的威胁，我们也强调要大声疾呼。”
作为回应，中国向南中国海发射了一系列导弹。
根据美联社的一份报告，在美国-东盟外交部长会议上，庞培先生还敦促东盟重新考虑与美国列入黑名单的公司的交易。
庞培说，美国和东盟也正在共同努力打击Covid-19，并使该地区的经济复苏以及其他卫生计划。

The meetings were dominated by US-China tensions, particularly surrounding the contested South China Sea.
"We also underscore our commitment to speak out in the face of the Chinese Communist Party's escalating aggression and threats to sovereign nations' ability to make free choices," said Mr Pompeo.
China responded by firing a series of missiles into the South China Sea.
During the US-Asean Foreign Ministers' Meeting, Mr Pompeo also urged Asean to reconsider deals with firms blacklisted by the US, according to an AP report.
The US and Asean are also working together to combat Covid-19 and enable the region's economic recovery, among other health programmes, said Mr Pompeo.

雪兰莪州，吉隆坡，布城的水资源共享雪兰莪州，吉隆坡和布城的联邦领土（通常称为巴生谷）共享相同的水资源。
水资产包括雪兰莪州的河流和水库，水处理厂以及主要是地下分配管网。
但是，当Langat 2水处理项目的第一阶段和第二阶段于今年1月开始运营时，这一比例增加到了10％。
JBAS有利可图的水处理服务已移交给私人，而亏损的水分配业务则由州政府负责。
后来，JBAS由国阵管理部门改组为Perbadanan Urus Air Selangor（Puas），或雪兰莪州的水务管理部门。

SELANGOR, KL, PUTRAJAYA SHARE WATER RESOURCESSelangor state, the federal territories of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya- generally called the Klang Valley - share the same water resources.
The water assets comprise rivers and reservoirs in Selangor, water treatment plants and the network of mostly underground distribution pipes.
But this increased to 10 per cent when the first and second phase of the Langat 2 Water Treatment project began operating in January this year.
The profitable water treatment services of JBAS were moved to private hands while the loss-making water distribution business was kept by the state government.
JBAS was later corporatised by under the BN administration as Perbadanan Urus Air Selangor (Puas), or water management authority of Selangor.

哥打京那巴鲁-总理穆希丁·雅辛（Muhyiddin Yassin）的第11小时干预未能消除他在沙巴州民意测验中盟友席位的重叠要求，这引发了人们对他的佩里卡丹国家（PN）政府内部统一的质疑。
他说：“重要的是，我们将作为一个团队来组建一个发展沙巴州的政府。
各级会员必须摒弃一切分歧和旧怨恨，接受新的加蓬安·拉基特·沙巴精神。
但是巫统立即拒绝了他的讲话中关于将国家Bersatu首席哈吉·诺尔（Hajiji Noor）任命为首席部长的建议，巫统坚持只有在结果公布后才能做出决定。
鉴于巫统不愿加入PN，所有迹象都表明，协议中各方之间的沙巴僵局将在下届大选中重演。

KOTA KINABALU - Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin's 11th hour intervention has failed to untangle overlapping claims for seats among his allies in the Sabah state polls, raising questions about the unity within his Perikatan Nasional (PN) government.
"What is important is that we will work as a team to form a government that will develop Sabah.
Members at all levels must put aside all disagreements and old grudges to embrace a new spirit of Gabungan Rakyat Sabah.
But the suggestion in his speech that state Bersatu chief Hajiji Noor be made chief minister was immediately rebuffed by Umno which insisted a decision would be made only after results were known.
Given Umno's reticence to join PN, all indications are that the Sabah impasse among parties in the pact will be repeated at the next general election.

华盛顿-美国总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）写了好几本通俗易懂的书，但近几周来他面对的大惊小怪，虽然证实了批评家的最担心和厌恶之情，却勉强划破了他的核心基地的势力范围。

WASHINGTON - United States President Donald Trump has had several tell-all books written about him, but a fusillade he has faced in recent weeks, while confirming the worst fears and loathing of his critics, has barely scratched the force shield of his core base.
The books include The Room Where It Happened by his former national security adviser John Bolton; Too Much And Never Enough: How My Family Created The World’s Most Dangerous Man by his niece Mary L. Trump, and Disloyal: A Memoir by his former attorney Michael Cohen.

多哈（路透社）-阿富汗政府代表和塔利班叛乱分子周六（9月12日）聚集在一起，进行了历史性的和平谈判，目的是结束长达二十年的战争，这场战争已经杀死了成千上万的战斗人员和平民。
在未来几天的面对面谈判之前，各个国家和团体敦促交战双方立即停火，并达成一项维护妇女权利的协议。
国务卿迈克·庞培（Mike Pompeo）敦促交战双方抓住时机，达成一项全面和平协议，同时承认面临许多挑战。
印尼外交大臣马尔索迪（Retno Marsudi）表示：“阿富汗人民必须处于和平进程的核心……不容任何人，包括妇女在内。
在阿富汗首都喀布尔的电视上观看时，老师帕里瓦什·法克什（Pariwash Farkish）说，尽管她目睹了暴力爆炸，和平对话对她非常重要，但她对此表示担忧。

DOHA (REUTERS) - Afghan government representatives and Taleban insurgents gathered on Saturday (Sept 12) for historic peace talks aimed at ending two decades of war that has killed tens of thousands of combatants and civilians.
Ahead of face-to-face negotiations in coming days, the warring sides were urged by various countries and groups to reach an immediate ceasefire and forge an agreement that upholds women’s rights.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged the warring sides to seize the opportunity to strike a comprehensive peace deal, while acknowledging many challenges lay ahead.
“The Afghan people must be at the heart of this peace process...that leaves no one behind, including women,” said Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi.
Watching on television in the Afghan capital Kabul, teacher Pariwash Farkish said that although she had witnessed violent blasts and peace talks were very important to her, she harboured concerns.

他们可以选择纸质凭证，也可以选择通过电子支付应用程序收集或绑定到信用卡或电子钱包的电子版本。
林郑月娥说：“我可以在7-11买到很多东西，而4000元新台币能使我住上好一阵子。”
台湾政府发布了针对公民的经济刺激券，可在今年年底之前使用。
该计划已与2009年全球衰退期间的前总统马英九的代金券计划进行了比较。
我取消了电子凭证，转而使用纸质版本。”现年30岁的郭玉文女士说，她在一家教育非政府组织工作。

They could choose between paper vouchers, or electronic versions that would be collected via electronic payment apps or tied to credit cards or e-wallets.
"There's so much at 7-11 I can buy, and the NT$4,000 will last me a good while," said Mrs Lin.
Taiwan's government released economic stimulus vouchers for citizens that can be used before the end of this year.
The programme has been compared to former president Ma Ying-jeou's voucher initiative in 2009 during the global recession.
I cancelled the electronic vouchers and went for the paper version," said Ms Kuo Yu-wen, 30, who works for an education non-government organisation.
