马尔代夫取而代之的是采用另一种地球工程方法：在一个新的人工岛上将其命名为Hulhumalé，从而创建了一个被称为“希望之城”的21世纪城市。
到达科维奇之前，好奇的游客可以在离首都马累约8公里的地方游览这座新岛城市，方法是从桥上搭飞机从机场乘坐20分钟公交车。
然而，很少有人在短暂的豪华假期中来到马尔代夫，而会想到胡鲁马莱旨在解决的务实社会问题。
她还颇具讽刺意味的是，胡鲁马莱在一个已经被某种程度破坏的地区正在崛起。
Philpot苦苦地解释说：“许多废物已被运输并存储在特制的蒂拉福希岛上。”

Instead, the Maldives turned to a different form of geo-engineering: creating a 21st-Century city, dubbed the “City of Hope”, on a new, artificial island christened Hulhumalé.
Pre-Covid, curious tourists could visit the new island city as it takes shape around 8km from the capital city of Malé by hopping on a 20-minute bus from the airport over the bridge.
Yet, few who come to the Maldives on short luxurious breaks will think about the pragmatic social issues Hulhumalé aims to solve.
She also makes the rather ironic observation that Hulhumalé is rising in an area that has already, to some extent, been spoiled.
“Much of the waste has been transported and stored in the purpose-built island of Thilafushi,” explained Philpot wryly.

在政府为减轻冠状病毒而进行的巨额支出的推动下，美国的预算赤字已超过30亿美元（合2.3亿英镑），创历史新高。
甚至在大流行爆发之前，美国今年的赤字就已经超过了10亿美元，按历史标准计算，这是很大的。
美国国会预算办公室本月预测，美国全年赤字可能达到$ 3.3tn，是去年缺口的三倍多。
联邦政府的财政年度在9月结束。
该计划未能推进，民主党人表示，该计划与他们支持的逾3千亿美元的救济金相差甚远。

Image copyright Getty ImagesThe US budget deficit has hit a record high of more than $3tn (£2.3tn), driven by the government's massive spending on coronavirus relief.
Even before the pandemic, the US was on track to run a deficit of more than $1tn this year - large by historic standards.
The Congressional Budget Office this month predicted that the US was likely to run a full-year deficit of $3.3tn, more than triple the shortfall recorded last year.
The federal government's financial year ends in September.
The plan failed to advance, with Democrats saying it fell far short of the more than $3tn in relief they support.

批评人士说，尽管这笔交易可能具有象征意义，但只会使英国的国内生产总值（GDP）提高0.07％，而这笔交易的一部分可能与欧盟损失。
英国贸易部的声明说，日产和日立等在英国的主要日本投资者将受益于对来自日本的零件降低的关税以及简化的监管程序。
但最终，该交易很大程度上反映了欧盟与日本之间已经存在的协议。
据估计，这两个国家的贸易总额有望增加150亿英镑，其中最大的份额就是80％。

Critics said while the deal may be of symbolic importance it would boost UK GDP by only 0.07%, a fraction of the trade that could be lost with the EU.
Major Japanese investors in the UK such as Nissan and Hitachi would benefit from reduced tariffs on parts coming from Japan and streamlined regulatory procedures, the UK's trade department statement said.
But ultimately, this deal largely mirrors the agreement which already exists between the EU and Japan.
It stands to get the lions share, 80%, of the total estimated £15bn boost to trade for both countries.
