接受CNN Business采访的劳工维权人士说，前工人报告的做法包含强迫劳动的内容。
Top Glove，Hartalega和Kossan表示，他们已采取措施防止招募人员剥削工人。
但是，当他降落在吉隆坡时，被告知他将以低于承诺的工资在Kossan手套工厂工作。
在所审查的六个月内，CNN Business接触了Top Glove，Kossan和Hartalega的24个最大买家，但仅收到了四份回复。
业界关注Top手套并不是唯一一家最近受到美国当局审查其工作方式的马来西亚手套制造商。

Labor rights activists who spoke to CNN Business said that practices reported by former workers contain elements of forced labor.
Top Glove, Hartalega and Kossan say they've taken measures to prevent the exploitation of workers by recruiters.
But when he landed in Kuala Lumpur, he was told he'd be working in a Kossan glove factory for a lower wage than promised.
CNN Business reached out to Top Glove, Kossan and Hartalega's 24 largest buyers over the six-month period examined but only received four replies.
Industry attentionTop Glove isn't the only Malaysian glove maker whose work practices have been recently scrutinized by US authorities.

（CNN）卫生官员周六告诉CNN，纳丹·沙克（Nadhim Shaker）是1970年代和80年代伊拉克最著名的足球明星之一，已死于Covid-19。
官员说，纳迪姆·沙克·沙克（Nadhim ShakerShaker）星期五在伊拉克北部城市埃尔比勒的一家医院死亡。
沙克尔是伊拉克足球史上最伟大的防守者之一，也是前伊拉克国家队教练。
伊拉克体育已经失去了它的鲜明标志之一，它向祖国展示了成就，为发展这项运动而努力，并在伊拉克人的心中传播了喜悦。”
伊拉克总统萨勒赫（Barham Salih）周六发了推文。

(CNN) Nadhim Shaker, one of Iraq's most famous soccer stars in the 1970s and '80s, has died from Covid-19, health officials told CNN on Saturday.
Nadhim ShakerShaker died Friday in a hospital in the northern Iraqi city of Erbil, officials said.
Shaker was one of the greatest defenders in Iraqi soccer history and a former Iraq National Team coach.
"Iraqi sport has lost one of its bright symbols, who presented achievements to the homeland, worked hard to develop the sport, and spread joy in Iraqis' hearts."
Iraqi President Barham Salih tweeted Saturday.

谁想要贸易协议？
但是，故意违反国际法会使其他国家的政府不太可能与英国接触。
上周五，英国与日本达成了一项贸易协定，并在很大程度上复制了该国与欧盟的协定，从而取得了胜利。
假设欧盟与英国之间的谈判破裂，包括日本交易在内的协议仅涵盖了英国贸易的10％。
仅剩几周的时间达成新的贸易协议，并避免新的关税和其他壁垒。

Who wants a trade deal?
But intentionally breaking international law makes other governments less likely to engage with the United Kingdom.
On Friday, the United Kingdom scored a victory when it clinched a trade agreement with Japan , largely replicating the agreement that country has with the European Union.
Assuming the EU-UK talks collapse, only 10% of UK trade is covered by agreements, including the Japan deal.
There are only weeks remaining in which to reach a new trade deal and avoid new tariffs and other barriers.

除三场命名的风暴（亚瑟，伯莎和多莉）以外，其他所有字母均创下了最早的命名风暴记录。

Sally -- also the earliest 18th named storm on record -- has already brought heavy rain and gusty winds to Florida Saturday as the storm moved into the Gulf of Mexico today.
Once it reaches that area of the Gulf Coast the steering patterns break down and the system meanders near the coast.
All but three named storms (Arthur, Bertha and Dolly) set records for being the earliest named storm for their respective letter.
The NHC is currently watching six areas: two tropical storms, two tropical depressions, and two tropical disturbances.
Tropical storm conditions will begin to impact Bermuda by Sunday afternoon and hurricane conditions will begin Sunday night."

（CNN）莎拉·欧弗曼（Sharea Overman）和她的丈夫内特（Nate）是三个小男孩的父母，并且像许多（我们都是真实的）父母一样-他们发现自己一直在疲倦。
因此，当五口之家决定驾车穿越印第安纳州探望家人时，Sharea看到她的丈夫在驾驶员座位上舒适地向后倾斜并不感到惊讶。
但是，不久之后，Sharea望着她的丈夫，拍了张照片，然后想：“男人，他看起来真的像是在驾驶员座位上晕倒了。”
兼职摄影师Sharea决定通过对丈夫开玩笑来消磨时间。
因此，我决定发布照片，并要求人们在照片中加入一些有趣的背景。

(CNN) Sharea Overman and her husband Nate are parents to three young boys and like many (let's be real, all) parents -- they find themselves constantly tired.
So, when the family of five decided to road trip across Indiana to visit family, Sharea wasn't surprised to see her husband slouched back comfortably in the driver's seat.
However, after a while Sharea looked over at her husband, snapped a photo and thought, "Man, he really looks like he is passed out in the driver's seat."
Sharea, a part-time photographer, decided to pass the time in the car by pulling a fun prank on her husband.
So, I decided to post the photo and asked people to photoshop some fun backgrounds into the photo.

我是那个年轻一代的一员，从第一次听到“说唱歌手的喜悦”开始，我就喜欢嘻哈音乐。
作为充满韵律之争的竞争领域，嘻哈时代已经一去不复返了。在这个嘻哈企业时代，这种激情已成为过去。
但是，苏富比的众多艺术品提醒我的是，并不是说嘻哈变得很棒，而是一直如此。
苏富比首次拍卖嘻哈音乐，包括近代和传统物品，将于9月15日在纽约举行。

I was a part of that young generation, and I loved hip hop from the first time I heard "Rapper's Delight."
Gone are the days of hip hop as a competitive field filled with rhyme battles; in this corporate era of hip hop, such passion is a thing of the past.
But what Sotheby's trove of artifacts does remind me is, it's not that hip hop has become great, it's that it always was.
Sotheby's first hip hop auction, of recent and legacy items, will be held in New York on September 15.

亚马尔陨石坑是该地区发现的第一个大洞。
爆炸全部喷出了地面冰，在某些情况下，地面上还留有孔，巨大的冰块掉落了。
Bogoyavlensky不相信这些火山口的主要原因是与气候变化有关的温度升高。
同样，纳塔利（Natali）说，她相信气候变化会发挥作用-尽管还需要更多数据来明确说明。
这些漏洞很少，因此可以肯定地说，这很棘手，但是我非常相信气候变化在其中发挥了作用。”

The Yamal Crater was the first of these massive holes to be discovered in the region.
The explosions all ejected ground ice, which in some cases leaves holes where huge frozen blocks have fallen on the surface.
Bogoyavlensky isn't convinced that the primary cause of these craters is warming temperatures linked to climate change.
Likewise, Natali said she believed climate change plays a role -- although more data is needed to say definitively.
There's so few of these holes so it might be tricky to say for certain, but I'm pretty confident climate change is playing a role in this."

它已被列为“ D颜色”，是白色钻石的最高等级，并且在内部和外部都被认为是“无瑕疵”的，从而跻身于世界上化学纯度最高，透明和对称的钻石之中。
根据苏富比拍卖行的说法，这颗钻石将仅是在拍卖会上出售的大小和质量可比的第八颗白钻。
据苏富比拍卖行称，迄今为止，只有七枚D色无瑕（或内部无瑕）钻石重达100克拉以上。
竞标将从9月15日开始在线拍卖，最终拍卖将于10月5日在香港进行现场拍卖。
尽管白色钻石可以在拍卖会上吸引巨大的竞标，但近几年粉红和蓝色品种的成交额甚至更高。

It has been classified as "D color," the highest grading for a white diamond, and is considered to be internally and externally "flawless," placing it among the world's most chemically pure, transparent and symmetrical diamonds.
The stone will be only the eighth white diamond of comparable size and quality to sell at auction, according to Sotheby's.
Credit: Sotheby'sOnly seven D color flawless (or internally flawless) diamonds weighing more than 100 carats have ever appeared at auction before, according to Sotheby's.
Bidding will open online from September 15, with the sale concluding at a live auction in Hong Kong on October 5.
While white diamonds can attract huge bids at auction, pink and blue varieties have achieved even larger sums in recent years.

每个地点都是独一无二的，但斯坦因茨注意到了一个共同的主题-人类正在改变地球。
在2018年《纽约时报》（New York Times）杂志派遣他到各个大洲记录气候变化之后，斯坦梅茨决定整理一本书，收集他整个职业生涯的图像。
“人类星球”记载了我们对环境的影响以及为保护环境而提出的解决方案。
偶然的环保主义者这种对世界的鸟瞰图使Steinmetz能够见证并记录人类改变地球的方式。
这位摄影师说他不打算记录气候变化，但他的工作档案使人类的足迹不可否认。

Each location was unique, but the Steinmetz noticed a common theme -- humans were changing the planet.
After a 2018 New York Times Magazine assignment that sent him to every continent to document climate change, Steinmetz decided to put together a book, collecting images spanning his whole career.
"Human Planet" chronicles our impact on the environment and the solutions we have come up with to try to save it.
The accidental environmentalistThis bird's-eye view of the world allowed Steinmetz to witness -- and document -- the ways humans have changed the planet.
The photographer says he didn't intend to document climate change, but his archive of work made humanity's footprint undeniable.

## 画飞机：为什么每一层都很重要

### Painting an airplane: Why every layer counts

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-当通过吸引人的飞机制服吸引公众注意时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常是白色，但并不总是白色（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板可以应用最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，并购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
