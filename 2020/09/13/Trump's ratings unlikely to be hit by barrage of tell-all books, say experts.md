WASHINGTON - United States President Donald Trump has had several tell-all books written about him, but a fusillade he has faced in recent weeks, while confirming the worst fears and loathing of his critics, has barely scratched the force shield of his core base.

The books include The Room Where It Happened by his former national security adviser John Bolton; Too Much And Never Enough: How My Family Created The World’s Most Dangerous Man by his niece Mary L. Trump, and Disloyal: A Memoir by his former attorney Michael Cohen.
