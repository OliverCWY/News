SINGAPORE - There were 42 new coronavirus cases confirmed as of Saturday (Sept 12), taking Singapore's total to 57,357, the Ministry of Health has said.

Forty-one of the cases were asymptomatic.

Of the new cases, 10 were imported ones, and they were placed on stay-home notice upon arrival here. Two are Singaporeans, and five are permanent residents who returned to Singapore from India on Aug 30 and Aug 31.

Another two imported patients are work pass holders who arrived separately from Germany on Aug 30 and Philippines on Aug 29.

The remaining case is a short-term visit pass holder who is the spouse of a Singaporean who arrived from India on Sept 5.

There were four community cases comprising one permanent resident, one work pass holder and two work permit holders, said MOH.

Migrant workers living in dormitories made up the remaining 28 new coronavirus patients announced on Saturday.

Among the 28, 16 were identified as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to determine their status.

The remaining 12 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such as bi-weekly rostered routine testing of workers living in dormitories.
