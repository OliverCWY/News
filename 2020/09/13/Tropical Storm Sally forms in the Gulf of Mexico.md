Sally -- also the earliest 18th named storm on record -- has already brought heavy rain and gusty winds to Florida Saturday as the storm moved into the Gulf of Mexico today.

Flood watches are in effect through Sunday for areas of Florida's west coast including Tampa, Bradenton, Port Charlotte and Fort Myers. In these areas, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected through the weekend.

Hurricane Watches and Tropical Storm Watches have already been issued along the Gulf Coast from Louisiana through the panhandle of Florida

Most forecast models have Sally moving toward the northern Gulf Coast and likely making landfall somewhere between New Orleans and Panama City by late Monday or Tuesday, however if the track shifts farther west or slows down, landfall may hold off until Wednesday.

"The cyclone will likely become a hurricane in 2 to 3 days, although an increase in vertical shear could slow the rate of intensification over the northern Gulf of Mexico," according to the National Hurricane Center.

Once it reaches that area of the Gulf Coast the steering patterns break down and the system meanders near the coast.

Whether the meandering is offshore prior to a landfall or onshore will not make much of a difference in terms of rainfall. In either case, because of the slow forward movement along the Gulf Coast significant flooding is possible.

As of right now, widespread rainfall accumulations of 4 to 6 inches are likely. However, there will be isolated areas right along the coast that could pick up more than a foot of rain.

Already an active season

Many storms broke records for being the earliest named to date, including Cristobal was the earliest named "C" letter storm in recorded history and Hanna was the earliest "H" letter storm. All but three named storms (Arthur, Bertha and Dolly) set records for being the earliest named storm for their respective letter.

Sally is just one of several systems in the Atlantic. The NHC is currently watching six areas: two tropical storms, two tropical depressions, and two tropical disturbances. Thursday marked the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season.

"Tropical Storm Paulette is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane today," says Haley Brink, CNN Meteorologist. "Paulette is forecast to track toward Bermuda and potentially make landfall early Monday morning as a category 2 storm. A hurricane watch is in effect for Bermuda with hurricane conditions possible within 48 hours. Tropical storm conditions will begin to impact Bermuda by Sunday afternoon and hurricane conditions will begin Sunday night."

Another system to watch is a broad area of low pressure southwest of the Cape Verde islands. This system is now Tropical Depression 20. After Sally there are only three names left on this year's official list: Teddy, Vicky, and Wilfred. After that the NHC will move on to using the Greek alphabet.

La Niña is officially here

On Thursday the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced they are issuing a La Niña Advisory , meaning La Niña conditions are present in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean.
