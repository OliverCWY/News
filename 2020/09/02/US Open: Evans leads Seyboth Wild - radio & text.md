Evans sets up what should be a straightforward volley as he comes forward and pushes Seyboth Wild right.

But he can't close it out and pushes the ball wide. The Brazilian struggles to land his winner on the next point, leaving the score at 40-30, before bringing Evans forward with a drop-shot and nudging a winner past the Brit.

Tie-break it is.
