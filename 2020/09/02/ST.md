新加坡-在新加坡上市的Axington Inc.周一（8月31日）午夜刚过，宣布其非独立非执行董事长沉怡雯女士和其他三名董事辞职。
沉女士（又称“沉彻”）是新加坡注册的Bellagraph Nova（BN）集团的联合创始人，该集团在有意收购英超联赛俱乐部纽卡斯尔联队的消息传出后，受到越来越多的审查。
BN Group还说Hydra X正在为SGX设计和实施交易系统。
在今年7月由新加坡堂兄Nelson Loh和Terence Loh收购了在Catalist上市的公司之后，现年32岁的Shen女士成为Axington董事长。
一个月前，Lohs'Dorr集团与Bellagraph合并后，她与二人组成立了BN集团。

SINGAPORE - Singapore-listed Axington Inc announced just after midnight on Monday (Aug 31) the resignation of its non-independent non-executive chairman, Ms Evangeline Shen, and three other directors.
Ms Shen, also known as Shen Che, is the co-founder of Singapore-registered Bellagraph Nova (BN) Group that has drawn increasing scrutiny following news of its takeover bid for English Premier League club Newcastle United.
Hydra X was also said by BN Group to be designing and implementing a trading system for SGX.
Ms Shen, 32, became Axington chairman after the buyout of the Catalist-listed firm by Singaporean cousins Nelson Loh and Terence Loh in July this year.
She set up the BN Group with the duo after a merger of the Lohs' Dorr Group and Bellagraph a month earlier.

Teo太太说：“我们仍处于风暴之中，我们尚需时日才能看到'绿芽'。”
她补充说，在Covid-19中，EP和S Pass持有者的数量在今年1月至7月之间减少了22,000。
太太说，这并不是由于某些人建议的永久居民增加。
在招聘方面，MOM女士将加大力度，以确保公平对待当地人。
Teo女士说：“要继续做生意，他们将不得不招募更多的本地人，这是他们一直以来应该做的事情。”

Said Mrs Teo: "We are still in the middle of a storm, and it will be sometime before we see 'green shoots'."
With Covid-19, the number of EP and S Pass holders has fallen by 22,000 between January and July this year, she added.
This is not due to an increase in permanent residents, as some have suggested, said Mrs Teo.
As for hiring, MOM will intensify efforts to ensure fair treatment of locals, said Mrs Teo.
"To stay in business, they will have to recruit more locals, something they should have done all along," said Mrs Teo.

Mrs Lam reiterated that about a quarter of the confirmed Covid-19 cases are without symptoms and “that is a very worrying trend”.
The mass testing is being carried out with the help of a team from mainland China, with some pan-democrats and activists, including a hospital workers’ union - the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance - calling for a boycott.
Previously, the government has had to dismiss rumours that the DNA of those tested would be collected by the mainland team sent over to help with the mass testing and sent to Chinese authorities.
