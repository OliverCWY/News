查理周刊（Charlie Hebdo）：杂志重新出版了有争议的穆罕默德（Mohammed）卡通漫画出版时间9小时前
最新版的封面刊登了先知穆罕默德的12幅原始漫画，这些漫画曾在丹麦报纸上发表，然后出现在查理周刊上。
“要在2015年1月恐怖袭击开庭审理的一周内复制这些动画片，对我们来说似乎至关重要。”
为什么Charlie Hebdo成为目标？
但正是由于其对先知穆罕默德的刻画，导致编辑团队面临死亡威胁，并在2011年对其办事处造成了汽油炸弹袭击。

The front cover of the latest edition features the 12 original cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, which were published in a Danish newspaper before appearing in Charlie Hebdo.
"To reproduce these cartoons in the week the trial over the January 2015 terrorist attacks opens seemed essential to us."
Why was Charlie Hebdo a target?
But it was its portrayals of the Prophet Mohammed that led to death threats against the editorial team and a petrol bomb attack on its offices in 2011.

埃文斯挺身而出，将塞伯特·维尔德（Seyboth Wild）推向正确的位置，这是一次简单的抽射。
但是他不能把球挡出并把球推开。
巴西人努力争取下一个胜利者，将比分保持在40-30，然后将埃文斯（Evans）放倒，并把胜利者带到了英国。
抢七局。

Evans sets up what should be a straightforward volley as he comes forward and pushes Seyboth Wild right.
But he can't close it out and pushes the ball wide.
The Brazilian struggles to land his winner on the next point, leaving the score at 40-30, before bringing Evans forward with a drop-shot and nudging a winner past the Brit.
Tie-break it is.

## 为什么法国人喜欢抱怨

但是，当我终于鼓起勇气问一个法国朋友时，他吓了一跳：他们不是抱怨者，他说。
在法国，“抱怨”有几个词：“ se plaindre”，用于常规的旧抱怨；有“搬运工抱怨”，因为抱怨更加正式。
您可能也对以下内容感兴趣：•为什么法国人喜欢拒绝••为什么这座城市如此宽容？
法国人对抱怨的态度令许多英语国家的人感到不舒服，其中许多人认为消极情绪会滋生消极情绪。
但是法国流氓很可能避免这种不幸的副作用，部分原因是他们很少抱怨自己的生活，而是抱怨外部问题。

But when I finally got up the courage to ask a French friend, he baulked: they weren’t complainers, he said.
In France, there are several words for “to complain”: there’s “se plaindre”, used for regular old complaining; there’s “porter plainte”, for complaining more officially.
You may also be interested in:• Why the French love to say no• Why is this city so tolerant?
The French attitude towards complaining is uncomfortable for many Anglophones, many of whom argue that negativity breeds negativity.
But French râleurs may well avoid this unfortunate side effect, in part because they rarely complain about their own lives but rather about external issues.

Neuralink是一项雄心勃勃的计划，旨在将人脑链接到计算机。
但是，马斯克的雄心要比大多数人大得多，他谈到发展“超人认知”-增强人脑，部分是为了抵抗他从人工智能中看到的威胁。

但是，如果没有他一直批评的学者，马斯克通过数字界面增强人脑的梦想就不可能实现。

Is Elon Musk over-hyping his brain-hacking Neuralink tech?
Neuralink is a hugely ambitious plan to link the human brain to a computer.
But Musk has far greater ambitions than most, talking of developing "superhuman cognition" - enhancing the human brain in part to combat the threat he sees from artificial intelligence.
Brain enhancingThis morning, I contacted Prof Jackson to apologise for provoking this Twitter pile-on.
But without the academics of whom he has been critical, Musk's dream of enhancing the human brain with a digital interface is unlikely to be realised.
