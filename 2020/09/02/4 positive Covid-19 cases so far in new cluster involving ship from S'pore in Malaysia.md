PETALING JAYA (THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - A new isolated Covid-19 cluster has been identified involving a ship's crew at Port Dickson in the state of Negeri Sembilan, said the Malaysian Health Ministry.

"The ship involved has a travelling history of originating from Singapore's port," it said in a statement on Monday (Aug 31).

"A total of 34 crew members have been screened on Aug 28, and from the total, four tested positive for Covid-19, six tested negative and 24 others are still awaiting results."

Health director-general Noor Hisham Abdullah said the four positive cases were asymptomatic and involved two Malaysians and two non-Malaysians.

"After being tested positive, they were sent to the Sungai Buloh Hospital, thus not having any risk of local community transmission as it is an isolated imported cluster," he said.

"Prevention and control measures such as disinfection and the decontamination process have been carried out on the ship, " he said, adding that the cause of infection was still under investigation.

A day earlier, the Health Ministry reported another Covid-19 cluster involving a ship docked at Port Klang in the state of Selangor.

Two people tested positive from eight of those linked to the ship.

The ministry believed the infection originated from a foreign national who worked on the vessel and is currently warded at the Sungai Buloh hospital for treatment.
