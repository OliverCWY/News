同时，在白宫简报室，他最小化了警察对非洲裔美国人的残酷对待，这激起了抗议和痛苦的夏天。
在经典的威权主义策略中，特朗普还大肆宣扬无法无天和政治暴力的程度，然后将自己提升为恢复秩序所需的那种强人。
然后才是他真正的话题：“左翼政治暴力”。
特朗普和家人没有联系的事实似乎表明，不想见总统。
“如果唐纳德·特朗普不能这么说，那么他就不适合当总统，而且他偏爱更多的暴力-而不是更少的暴力-是显而易见的。”

At the same time, in the White House briefing room, he minimized police brutality against African Americans that sparked a summer of protest and agony.
In a classic authoritarian tactic, Trump also vastly over stated the extent of lawlessness and political violence, then promoted himself as the kind of strongman needed to restore order.
Then it was on to his real topic: "left-wing political violence."
The fact Trump and the family have not connected appears to indicate there is no desire to meet the President.
"If Donald Trump can't say that, then he is unfit to be President, and his preference for more violence -- not less -- is clear."

新德里（CNN）中国政府指责印度军队非法侵入中国领土，其言论可能为在两个月之内在两个核大国之间进行第二次紧张的边界对峙做好准备。
中国驻印度大使馆发言人在星期二发表的声明中说，印度军队在周末“进行了公然的挑衅”，“这再次激起了边境地区的紧张局势。”
2019年8月3日拍摄的航拍照片显示了沿着中国西南部藏族自治区的班公错湖的一条道路。
自1962年两国发生第一次边境战争以来，中国和印度一直在围绕着湖泊的地区争吵。
穿过班公错的实际控制线是在最初的冲突之后建立的，但这并不是确切的边界。

New Delhi (CNN) China's government has accused Indian troops of illegally trespassing onto Chinese territory, in comments that could set the stage for a second tense border standoff between the two nuclear powers in just three months.
In a statement Tuesday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in India said that Indian forces had "conducted flagrant provocations" over the weekend "which again stirred tension in the border areas."
An Aerial photo taken on August 3, 2019 shows a road along the Pangong Tso lake in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region.
China and India have been sparring over the area that surrounds the lake since the two fought the first of several border wars in 1962.
The Line of Actual Control, which passes through Pangong Tso, was established in the wake of the original conflict, but it's not an exact border.

（CNN）周一下午，在洛杉矶南部的一场对抗中，洛杉矶县警长的代表致命地枪杀了一名29岁的黑人Dijon Kizzee，在现场引发了抗议。
警长部门说，大约在下午3点15分。当地时间，两名代表试图制止骑着自行车“违反车辆法规”的基兹。
迪恩说，当时，代表们“注意到他放下的衣服里面是一把黑色的半自动手枪”，那时两位代表都开枪射击了该男子“几次”。
该名男子后来被洛杉矶县医学检查官办公室认定为Kizzee，在现场被宣布死亡。定于星期二晚些时候进行尸检。
迪恩说，两个代表都没有受伤。

(CNN) Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies fatally shot Dijon Kizzee, a 29-year-old Black man, during a confrontation Monday afternoon in South LA, sparking protests at the scene.
The sheriff's department says that at about 3:15 p.m. local time two deputies tried to stop Kizzee, who was riding a bicycle "in violation of vehicle codes."
It was at that point deputies "noticed that inside the clothing items he dropped was a black semiautomatic handgun," and that's when both deputies opened fire, shooting the man "several" times, Dean said.
The man, later identified by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office as Kizzee, was pronounced dead at the scene; an autopsy is scheduled for later Tuesday.
Neither of the deputies were injured, Dean said.

（CNN）在澳大利亚北领地一个偏僻的旅游热点中，发现了一条长14.4英尺（4.4米）的巨大盐水鳄鱼。
这只鳄鱼重约771磅（350公斤），是野生生物护林员于上周五在弗洛拉河自然公园的一个陷阱中捕获的。弗洛拉河自然公园是内陆小镇凯瑟琳西南部一个受欢迎的旅游胜地。
北方领土旅游，体育和文化部发言人说，鳄鱼是该地区多年来捕获的最大鳄鱼。
发言人说，捕获物已被带到鳄鱼养殖场，有可能用于繁殖。
2018年7月，一条更大的盐水鳄鱼被捕，被捕到约15.4英尺（4.7米）的海中，并被困在靠近大海的凯瑟琳河中。

(CNN) An enormous saltwater crocodile measuring 14.4 feet (4.4 meters) has been caught at a remote tourist hotspot in Australia's Northern Territory.
The crocodile, estimated to weigh 771 pounds (350 kilograms), was captured by wildlife rangers last Friday at a trap in the Flora River Nature Park, a popular tourist destination southwest of the outback town of Katherine.
The crocodile is the largest caught in the area in years, according to a spokesperson at the Northern Territory Department of Tourism, Sport, and Culture.
The capture has been taken to a crocodile farm and will possibly be used for breeding, the spokesperson said.
In July 2018, an even larger saltwater crocodile measuring 15.4 feet (4.7 meters) was trapped and caught in the Katherine River closer to the sea.

罗尔斯·罗伊斯（Rolls-Royce）在准备开发新的Ghost时，了解到那些通常会购买该车型的客户不再需要醒目的富裕象征。
在内部和外部，Ghost显示出一种通常与斯堪的纳维亚设计和瑞典沃尔沃（Volvo）等公司相关的简单性。
但是罗尔斯·罗伊斯的工程师意识到，起初他们使汽车内部太安静了。
声音工程师已经将220磅的隔音材料放入汽车中，包括窗户玻璃内部和轮胎中。

(CNN) Rolls-Royce unveiled its all new Ghost Tuesday, and it looks strikingly different from any Rolls-Royce that has ever come before.
In preparing to develop the new Ghost, Rolls-Royce learned that customers who would typically buy this model no longer wanted an eye-catching emblem of affluence.
Outside and inside, the Ghost displays a sort of simplicity usually associated with Scandinavian design and companies like Sweden's Volvo.
But Rolls-Royce engineers realized they'd initially made the car too quiet inside.
Sound engineers had put 220 pounds of sound insulating material into the car, including inside window glass and in the tires.

从1980年代到今年，前加盟商共同经营着约200家餐厅。

New York (CNN Business) A group of 52 former Black franchise operators is suing McDonald's over alleged racial discrimination.
The lawsuit, filed late Monday night, accused McDonald's of systematically discriminating against Black franchise operators by offering better financial support and more favorable locations to their White counterparts.
The former franchisees, who together operated about 200 restaurants, operated stores from the 1980s through this year.
A customer's drink sits on a table inside the McDonald's Corp. flagship restaurant in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., on Monday, July 22, 2019.
In a video sent out to McDonald's US employees, suppliers and franchisees on Tuesday morning, CEO Chris Kempczinski responded to the lawsuit.

（CNN）根据一项新的研究，由于气候变化，美洲狮od在北美洲大陆上数千英里的高空迁移了80万年，而在11,000年前就灭绝了。
在这些温暖的时期向北迁移到北极的群体遗传多样性较低，这意味着它们彼此非常相似。
科学家们认为，人类对食物，气候变化的竞争以及早期人类的过度追捕相结合是罪魁祸首。
但是这项研究还为目前正在经历气候变化并对气候变化做出反应的动物（例如驼鹿和海狸）提供了外卖。
这种变化也适用于其他动物，它们通过扩展到新的领域来应对气候变化。

(CNN) American mastodons migrated many times across thousands of miles up and down the North American continent over 800,000 years due to climate change, before going extinct 11,000 years ago, according to a new study.
And the groups that migrated northward to the Arctic during these warm periods were less genetically diverse, meaning they were very similar to one another.
Scientists believe a combination of competition for food, climate change and overhunting by early humans is to blame.
But the study also provided takeaways for animals currently experiencing and reacting to climate change, like moose and beavers.
This change applies to other animals as well that react to climate change by expanding into new territories.

（CNN）-很难记得隔离不是我们词汇的常规部分，但是，对于我们大多数人来说，只有六个月前，我们很少听到使用或大声说出这个词-除了描述历史小说或Hulu表演的场景之外。
随着整个国家努力遏制Covid-19的传播，许多国家已经采取了严格的措施，以确保其家园，居民和访客的安全。
强制隔离是执行此操作的一种方法。
平凡的故事，分配的电话，外界时间的出价以及倒数日的传说都可以在互联网上找到。
然而，故事总是比图画更好。

(CNN) — It's hard to remember a time when quarantine wasn't a regular part of our vocabulary, yet, for most of us, it was only six months ago that we'd rarely heard the word used or spoken it aloud -- outside of describing a scene from an historical novel or a Hulu show.
As entire nations grapple with curbing the spread of Covid-19, many have implemented strict measures to keep their homelands and their residents and visitors safe.
Mandatory quarantines are one way of doing this.
Tales of mundane meals, allotted phone calls, bids for outside time and counting down the days are an Internet search away.
And yet, often nothing tells a story better than a picture.

旧金山（CNN商业版），您愿意为智能手机支付1,999美元吗？
该公司周二表示，这家韩国智能手机制造商的最新设备三星Galaxy Z Fold 2是三星当前产品线中最昂贵的智能手机，将于9月18日上市。
这款折叠式智能手机将于9月2日开始接受预订。
Z Fold 2于8月首次亮相，是三星最新的设备，具有可折叠的显示屏-展开时为6.2英寸前屏和7.6英寸内屏。
三星的折叠式智能手机的第一个版本，即售价为1,980美元的Galaxy Fold，在早期的评论家表示其不断闪烁并且折叠屏太容易破裂之后，于去年推迟了几个月。

San Francisco (CNN Business) Would you fork over $1,999 for a smartphone?
The South Korean smartphone maker's latest device, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2, is the most expensive smartphone in Samsung's current lineup and will go on sale Sept. 18, the company said Tuesday.
The folding smartphone will be available for pre-order starting Sept. 2.
The Z Fold 2, first revealed in August , is Samsung's newest device with a foldable display — a 6.2-inch front screen and a 7.6-inch inner screen when the device is unfolded.
Samsung's first iteration of the folding smartphone, the $1,980 Galaxy Fold, was delayed by several months last year after early reviewers flagged that it constantly flickered and the folding screen broke too easily.

专家认为，伦勃朗的一幅被认为是伪造的藏在地下室数十年的伦勃朗画作实际上是真实的。根据专家的说法，伦勃朗的画作与其他17世纪杰作是在同一棵树上的木头上作画的。
这幅肖像画是伦勃朗最近被重新归类给艺术家的许多被解雇的作品之一。
树木定年专家彼得·克莱恩（Peter Klein）分析了树木的年轮，以确定何时砍伐树木。
上面写着：“伦勃朗画的一个老人头。
现在，许多绘画作品被重新视为真实的伦勃朗作品，而最近的分析推翻了数十年来对某些作品的假设。

Written by Rob Picheta, CNN LondonA Rembrandt painting that was thought to be fake and was stashed in a basement for decades may in fact be genuine, according to experts who believe it was painted on wood from the same tree as other 17th century masterpieces.
The portrait is one of a number of dismissed Rembrandt works that have been recently re-attributed to the artist.
Peter Klein, an expert in tree dating, analyzed the growth rings of the tree to determine when it was felled.
It reads: "A Head of an Old Man, painted by Rembrandt.
While a number of paintings are now being reconsidered as authentic Rembrandt pieces, with recent analysis overturning decades of assumptions about some works.

每个地点都是独一无二的，但斯坦因茨注意到了一个共同的主题-人类正在改变地球。
在2018年《纽约时报》（New York Times）杂志派遣他到各个大洲记录气候变化之后，斯坦梅茨决定整理一本书，收集他整个职业生涯的图像。
“人类星球”记载了我们对环境的影响以及为保护环境而提出的解决方案。
偶然的环保主义者这种鸟瞰世界使Steinmetz能够见证并记录人类改变地球的方式。
这位摄影师说他不打算记录气候变化，但他的工作档案使人类的足迹不可否认。

Each location was unique, but the Steinmetz noticed a common theme -- humans were changing the planet.
After a 2018 New York Times Magazine assignment that sent him to every continent to document climate change, Steinmetz decided to put together a book, collecting images spanning his whole career.
"Human Planet" chronicles our impact on the environment and the solutions we have come up with to try to save it.
The accidental environmentalistThis bird's-eye view of the world allowed Steinmetz to witness -- and document -- the ways humans have changed the planet.
The photographer says he didn't intend to document climate change, but his archive of work made humanity's footprint undeniable.

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-通过吸引人的飞机制服吸引公众注意力时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常为白色，但并非总是如此（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板应用了最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，合并和收购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
