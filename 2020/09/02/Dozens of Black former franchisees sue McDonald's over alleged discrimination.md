New York (CNN Business) A group of 52 former Black franchise operators is suing McDonald's over alleged racial discrimination.

The lawsuit, filed late Monday night, accused McDonald's of systematically discriminating against Black franchise operators by offering better financial support and more favorable locations to their White counterparts. The former franchisees, who together operated about 200 restaurants, operated stores from the 1980s through this year.

According to the complaint, McDonald's "systematically steered" the plaintiffs toward stores in locations that required more security and made less in sales than others, and misled them about how profitable the restaurants could be.

"These allegations fly in the face of everything we stand for as an organization and as a partner to communities and small business owners around the world," McDonald's said in a statement in response to the lawsuit Tuesday. "Not only do we categorically deny the allegations that these franchisees were unable to succeed because of any form of discrimination by McDonald's, we are confident that the facts will show how committed we are to the diversity and equal opportunity of the McDonald's System, including across our franchisees, suppliers and employees," the statement continued.
