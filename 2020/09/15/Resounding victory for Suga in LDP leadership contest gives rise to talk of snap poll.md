TOKYO - Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga resounding win in Monday's (Sept 14) ruling party election to succeed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe fuelled talk of a snap election to allow the new leader to cement his position with a public mandate.

Mr Suga dodged a question about this on Monday but deputy prime minister Taro Aso and defence minister Taro Kono have both said they expect a snap election next month. A general election is due in October next year.
