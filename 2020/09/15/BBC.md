国会议员以340票对263票支持了《内部市场法案》。
部长们说，如果就未来贸易协议的谈判破裂，它包含了保护北爱尔兰和英国其他地区的重要保障措施。
该法案旨在使当2021年1月1日英国离开欧盟单一市场和关税同盟时，商品和服务能够自由流经英格兰，苏格兰，威尔士和北爱尔兰。
在长达五个小时的辩论中，约翰逊先生声称欧盟目前的做法可能导致对从英国到北爱尔兰的商品进行过多的检查甚至征收关税。
下议院也以349票对213票的投票结果否决了一项完全否决该法案的劳工修正案。

MPs backed the Internal Market Bill by 340 votes to 263.
Ministers say it contains vital safeguards to protect Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, if negotiations on a future trade deal break down.
The bill is designed to enable goods and services to flow freely across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland when the UK leaves the EU's single market and customs union on 1 January 2021.
During a five-hour debate, Mr Johnson claimed the EU's current approach could lead to excessive checks and even tariffs on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
The Commons also voted against a Labour amendment to reject the bill entirely by 349 votes to 213.

特朗普先生驳斥了一位官员不要“无视气候变化的科学”的呼吁，他说：“它将开始变得凉爽，你只是看...
气候变化成为政治中心舞台至少在一天之内，气候变化是美国总统竞选活动的重中之重。
他补充说：“当您进入气候变化时，印度会改变方式吗？
“我们认为科学是存在的，观察到的证据是不言而喻的：气候变化是真实的，并且正在加剧这一情况。”
特朗普此前曾将气候变化称为“神话”，“不存在”或“昂贵的骗局”，但也将其描述为“严肃的话题”。

Dismissing one official's plea to not "ignore the science" on climate change, Mr Trump said: "It'll start getting cooler, you just watch...
Climate change takes political centre stageAt least for one day, climate change is front-and-centre in the US presidential campaign.
He added: "When you get into climate change, well is India going to change its ways?
"We submit the science is in and observed evidence is self-evident: that climate change is real and that is exacerbating this."
Mr Trump has previously called climate change "mythical", "non-existent", or "an expensive hoax" - but has also described it as a "serious subject".

越南法院已判处两兄弟死刑，理由是他们在1月份臭名昭著的土地纠纷中杀害了三名警察。
法院裁定，Le Dinh Cong和他的弟弟Le Dinh Chuc帮助策划了对警察的抵抗。
他们的父亲是84岁的退休的当地官员勒丁·金（Le Dinh Kinh），被进入东塔姆村的警察枪杀。
东潭发生了什么事？
但是当地人抗议说，他们没有为被没收的土地获得适当的补偿，并抵制了夺取土地的企图。

A court in Vietnam has sentenced two brothers to death for their role in the killing of three policemen in a notorious land dispute in January.
Le Dinh Cong and his younger brother Le Dinh Chuc helped mastermind resistance against the police, the court ruled.
Their father, retired local official Le Dinh Kinh, 84, was shot dead by police who had entered Dong Tam village.
What happened in Dong Tam?
But locals protested that they had not been properly compensated for the seized land, and resisted the attempt to take it.

他们以卢森堡市的绰号“北方的直布罗陀”而闻名，1994年被联合国教科文组织指定为世界遗产。
尽管这主要是为了解决卢森堡市的交通拥堵问题，但这是该市交通的大胆举措和特征。
诸如免费的全市WiFi和现代环境行动计划等举措标志着卢森堡市21世纪的雄心壮志。
实际上，尽管卢森堡市的人口只有12万左右，但其卢森堡居民中有70％以上是非卢森堡人。
对于一个在地图上很难发现的无聊的城市来说，还不错。

Earning Luxembourg City the nickname “The Gibraltar of the North”, they were designated a World Heritage site by Unesco in 1994.
Though largely a bid to solve Luxembourg City’s traffic congestion problem, it was a bold move and characteristic of the city’s drive.
Initiatives like free city-wide WiFi and a modern environmental action plan have signalled Luxembourg City’s 21st-Century ambition.
In fact, while Luxembourg City only has a population of around 120,000, more than 70% of its residents are non-Luxembourgers.
Not bad for a boring city that’s difficult to spot on a map.

## 女人为什么写男人的名字？

### Why do women write under men’s names?

在某些情况下，这可能是正确的–在不同的时间，不同的国家，对于不同种族，不同阶级背景的女性来说，性别歧视绝对是让人难以抗拒的原因。
“实际上，在小说的兴起中，女性作家的举足轻重，”萨姆·赫斯特（Sam Hirst）博士指出，他是副讲师兼免费在线浪漫歌德课程主持人。
“通过复制这些叙述（女性只有拥有男性化名才能出版），您才能完全消除所有其他女性的存在。
在18世纪末和19世纪初，哥特式小说大受欢迎，并且在很大程度上与女性有关。
女作家主导着整个行业，安·拉德克利夫（Ann Radcliffe）凭借《乌道夫的奥秘》（The Mysteries of Udolpho）取得了创纪录的进步，并多次转载。

There are cases where this may be true – at different times, in different countries, and for women of different races, and different class backgrounds, sexism has absolutely contributed to a struggle to be heard.
“Actually, you have a load of women writers being incredibly important in the rise of the novel,” points out Dr Sam Hirst, an associate lecturer and host of free online Romancing the Gothic classes.
“By reproducing these narratives – that women couldn’t publish unless they had a male pseudonym – you are completely erasing the existence of all of these other women.
In the late 18th and early 19th Centuries, the Gothic novel was wildly popular, and also largely associated with women.
Female writers dominated the industry, with Ann Radcliffe achieving a record-breaking advance with The Mysteries of Udolpho, reprinted multiple times.

拥有梅赛德斯-奔驰的德国汽车制造商戴姆勒（Daimler）已同意支付15亿美元（合12亿英镑），以解决美国政府声称其设计柴油车欺骗空气污染测试的说法。
戴姆勒称该交易是解决柴油诉讼的“重要步骤”，但否认了这一要求。
戴姆勒表示，除了与美国当局达成15亿美元的和解协议外，它还同意支付7亿美元以解决业主提起的集体诉讼。
该公司同意以大约8亿美元的价格和解，以解决1月在美国的民事诉讼。
戴姆勒表示，美国和解协议涉及在欧洲未销售相同配置的车辆。

In addition to the $1.5bn settlement with US authorities, Daimler said it had agreed to pay $700m to settle a class action lawsuit brought by owners.
The firm agreed to an estimated $800m settlement to resolve civil claims in the US in January.

英国媒体PA MediaUK和欧洲汽车制造商警告说，无协议退欧可能会在未来五年内对该地区的汽车业造成1000亿英镑的损失，这将加剧Covid-19已经造成的沉重损失。
但越来越多的人担心，到那时双方将无法达成长期贸易协议。
总干事埃里克·马克·休伊特玛（Eric-Mark Huitema）表示：“否则，我们的部门-已经从Covid危机中解脱-将遭受双重打击。”
这将打击汽车制造商的利润，关税上涨将转嫁给消费者，从而影响需求。
它呼吁达成一项自由贸易协定，该协定也将适用于替代燃料的汽车和汽车零部件，并“涉及零关税或配额”。

Image copyright PA MediaUK and European car makers have warned a no-deal Brexit could put a £100bn dent in the region's car industry in the next five years, adding to heavy losses already caused by Covid-19.
But fears are growing that both sides will be unable to strike a longer-term trade deal by then.
"Otherwise our sector - already reeling from the Covid crisis - will be hit hard by a double whammy," said director general Eric-Mark Huitema.
This would hit car makers' margins and tariff increases would be passed on to consumers, impacting demand.
It called for a free trade deal that would also apply to alternatively fuelled vehicles and car components and "involve zero tariffs or quotas".

当时，软银宣布已同意在法律上具有约束力的承诺，以增加投资，增加员工人数并保留其在英国的总部。
ARM的联合创始人赫尔曼·豪瑟尔（Hermann Hauser）将这笔交易描述为“对剑桥，英国和欧洲来说绝对是一场灾难”。
Nvidia的老板称ARM为“有史以来最伟大的技术公司之一”。
我问过一位前内阁大臣，新政权是否允许将ARM最初出售给软银。
英国技术的皇冠上的明珠已经传遍了国际投资者，但这位新任老板说，尽管所有者发生了变化，但它并没有任何进展。

At that time, Softbank announced it had agreed to legally binding commitments to increase investment, headcount and preserve its headquarters in the UK.
ARM's co-founder Hermann Hauser described the deal as "an absolute disaster for Cambridge, the UK, and Europe".
Nvidia's boss described ARM as "one of the greatest technology companies of all time".
I asked a former cabinet minister if the original sale of ARM to Softbank would have been allowed by the new regime.
The crown jewel of UK technology has been passed around international investors but the new boss says although the owners have changed, it's not going anywhere.
