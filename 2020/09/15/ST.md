东京-日本内阁官房长官须贺喜秀（Hoshihide Suga）在周一（9月14日）执政党大选中大获全胜，以继任安倍晋三首相，这引发了有关举行大选以允许新领导人巩固其职位以公开授权的说法。
须贺真彦周一回避了有关此事的问题，但副首相麻生太郎和国防部长河野太郎均表示，预计下个月将举行大选。
大选将于明年十月举行。

TOKYO - Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga resounding win in Monday's (Sept 14) ruling party election to succeed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe fuelled talk of a snap election to allow the new leader to cement his position with a public mandate.
Mr Suga dodged a question about this on Monday but deputy prime minister Taro Aso and defence minister Taro Kono have both said they expect a snap election next month.
A general election is due in October next year.

自9月20日起，美国总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）禁止美国实体与腾讯的超级应用程序微信打交道，而印度的热门游戏PUBG Mobile和《勇敢的竞技场》则被禁止。
腾讯在一份声明中表示，除了目前在马来西亚，印度尼西亚和泰国的业务，腾讯还将在新加坡开设新的办事处，以“支持我们在东南亚及其他地区不断发展的业务”。
该公司表示，它正在招聘各种职位，包括技术和业务开发，但未提供细节。
到目前为止，腾讯在东南亚的足迹较小。
该公司表示，在2019年最后一个季度，《使命召唤》（Call of Duty Mobile）和《 PUBG Mobile》（PUBG Mobile）等国际游戏占据了腾讯170亿美元游戏帝国的23％。

US President Donald Trump has banned US entities from dealing with Tencent's super-app WeChat from Sept 20, while the company's hit games PUBG Mobile and Arena of Valor are banned in India.
Tencent said in a statement that it will open a new office in Singapore to "support our growing business in South-east Asia and beyond," in addition to current ones in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand.
It's recruiting for various positions including tech and business development, the company said, without offering details.
Tencent thus far has had a smaller footprint in South-east Asia.
In 2019's final quarter, international titles like Call of Duty Mobile and PUBG Mobile accounted for 23 per cent of Tencent's US$17 billion gaming empire, according to the company.

他说：“因此，为了保护公司，香港航空枢纽和尽可能多的人的生计，重组是不可避免的。”
他说，上个月完成的一项390亿港元的资本重组计划给公司带来了一段时间，但“这是我们需要偿还的投资”。
国泰航空（Cathay）正在进行战略审查，该公司上个月公布上半年净亏损99亿港元。
国泰航空和国泰港龙航空在8月份只接待了35,773名乘客，比去年同月下降了98.8％。
国泰股价周一在香港股市下跌了0.3％。

"A restructuring will therefore be inevitable to protect the company, the Hong Kong aviation hub, and the livelihoods of as many people as possible," Mr Lam said.
A HK$39 billion recapitalisation plan completed last month brought the company some time, but "it is an investment that we need to repay", he said.
Cathay, which last month reported a first-half net loss of HK$9.9 billion, is undergoing a strategic review.
Cathay and Cathay Dragon flew only 35,773 passengers in August, a slump of 98.8 per cent from the same month last year.
Cathay's shares slipped 0.3 per cent in Hong Kong trade on Monday.

柔佛州高级官员表示，柔佛州政府正计划在铜锣的马来西亚一侧建设一条覆盖人行道的3.5亿人行道，耗资3000万林吉特（990万新元）。
Mohd Solihan先生在柔佛州议会程序的间隙对记者说，在重新设计人行道后，加上自动扶梯和空调，马来西亚联邦政府已将其最初拨款1500万令吉翻了一番。
他说：“这项工程将涉及内政部和工程部，因为柔佛铜锣由马来西亚公路局负责维护。”
“对于我们这部分路线，建设成本是通过财政部来完成的，而实施是通过工务部来进行的。”
他说，他遇见的新加坡驻新山领事馆官员对该项目表示了兴趣。

ISKANDAR PUTERI - The Johor state government is planning to build a 350m covered walkway for pedestrians on the Malaysian side of the Causeway, at a cost of RM30 million (S$9.9 million), a senior Johor official has said.
Malaysia's federal government has doubled its initial allocation of RM15 million after the walkway was redesigned, with escalators and air-conditioning added in, Mr Mohd Solihan told reporters on the sidelines of the Johor state assembly proceedings.
"The construction will involve the Home Ministry and Works Ministry as the Johor Causeway is maintained by the Malaysian Highway Authority," he said.
"For our part of the route, the construction cost is via the Finance Ministry and its implementation is by the Works Ministry."
He said that Singapore Consulate officials in Johor Baru whom he met had expressed interest in the project, Bernama reported.

首尔（路透社）-韩国检察官周一（9月14日）以欺诈和贪污罪名起诉了日本战时性剥削受害者辩护小组的前领导人。
从那以后，她一直被指控为自己的利益而不是帮助“慰安妇”而使用政府补贴，这对日本人是一种委婉的说法。
今年五月，著名的受害者和激进主义者李永-（Lee Yong-soo）指控Yoon剥削这些妇女以获取政府资金和公共捐款，同时又花了很少的钱。
这场争执有可能破坏由Yoon，Lee和Jungdaehyup领导数十年的战时性暴力运动，二者在有效废除2015年与日本的和解协议中发挥了关键作用。
这个问题仍然是美国两个盟国之间关系紧张的主要因素。

SEOUL (REUTERS) - South Korean prosecutors on Monday (Sept 14) indicted the former leader of an advocacy group for victims of Japanese wartime sexual exploitation on charges of fraud and embezzlement.
Since then, she has been dogged by allegations that she used government subsidies for her own benefit rather than to help the "comfort women" - a Japanese euphemism for those forced to work in Japan's wartime brothels.
In May, Lee Yong-soo, a prominent victim and activist, accused Yoon of exploiting the women to garner government funds and public donations while spending little money on them.
The feud threatens to undermine the wartime sexual violence movement, led for decades by Yoon, Lee and Jungdaehyup, which together played a key role in effectively nullifying a 2015 settlement with Japan.
The issue remains a major factor in fraught relations between the two US allies.

知情人士说，阿里巴巴集团（Alibaba Group Holding）正在商讨向东南亚打车巨头Grab Holdings投资30亿美元（合41亿新元）。
自2016年对Lazada进行首次投资以来，这笔交易可能是阿里巴巴在东南亚最大的赌注之一。
在同意不让对方进入核心市场之前，世界上最大的叫车公司已经在对方的领土上进行了数年的代价高昂的战斗。
孙正义先生的软银集团（SoftBank Group）是全球所有最大的打车公司的投资者，是讨论的重点。
价值100亿美元的Grab和Gojek是激烈的竞争者，其雄心壮志是打造一款多功能的“超级应用程序”。

SINGAPORE (BLOOMBERG) - Alibaba Group Holding is in talks to invest US$3 billion (S$4.1 billion) into South-east Asian ride-hailing giant Grab Holdings, according to people familiar with the matter.
The deal may represent one of Alibaba's biggest bets on South-east Asia since its first investment in Lazada in 2016.
The world's biggest ride-hailing companies have waged years of costly battles in each others' territories before they agreed to stay out of each others' core markets.
Mr Masayoshi Son's SoftBank Group, an investor in all of the world's biggest ride-hailing companies, is at the centre of the discussions.
Grab and Gojek, valued at US$10 billion, are fierce rivals with an ambition to create an all-in-one "super app."

即使非洲大陆的病例激增，死亡人数仍保持相对稳定。
据克鲁格博士说，随着研究的进展，对病毒的了解仍然不完善，这意味着必须以不完整的图片来做出决定。
WHO数据显示，自6月初以来，在WHO欧洲覆盖的国家中，每日死亡人数一直保持在相同水平，每天约有400-500例死亡与Covid-19相关。
克鲁格博士说：“今年2月，我们以社会为目标……现在，我们以病毒为目标。”
克鲁格博士说：“如果我们有一个好的监视系统，我们应该能够在本地进行控制，然后在几周内再放松一次。”

Even though the continent is experiencing a surge of cases, the number of deaths has remained relatively stable.
According to Dr Kluge, as research progresses, knowledge of the virus remains imperfect, meaning that decisions must be made with an incomplete picture.
In countries covered by WHO Europe, the number of daily deaths has remained at around the same level since early June, with around 400-500 deaths per day linked to Covid-19, WHO data showed.
"In February we were targeting society... now we are targeting the virus," Dr Kluge said, adding that measures could now be imposed on a more local level.
"If we have a good surveillance system we should be able to control it locally and then in a couple of weeks, relax again," Dr Kluge said.

尽管一些意大利学校本月初开学，但周一共有800万学生中的约560万学生重返校园，面临着新的限制现实。
总理朱塞佩·孔戴（Giuseppe Conte）周日承认，意大利学校面临困境，包括缺少教师，单座位长椅和手术口罩。
孔戴在Facebook上写道：“尤其是在开始时，会有很多困难和不便。”
由于该国每天有1500例感染病例，孔戴先生对年轻人也有特别的用词。
取得正面结果后，只有在隔一天进行两次负面测试后，才允许学生返回学校。

Although some Italian schools opened earlier this month, roughly 5.6 million students from a total of eight million went back to school on Monday, confronting a new reality of restrictions.
Premier Giuseppe Conte admitted on Sunday that Italian schools faced a difficult situation, including a lack of teachers, single-seat benches and surgical masks.
"There will be difficulties and inconveniences, especially in the beginning," Mr Conte wrote on Facebook.
With the country registering more than 1,500 infections a day, Mr Conte also had particular words for youngsters.
After a positive result, pupils will be allowed back to school only after returning two negative tests, carried out a day apart.

悉尼（路透社）-由于当局开始放宽旨在减缓其传播的限制，澳大利亚周一（9月14日）报告了新颖的冠状病毒感染在过去三个月以来的单日最低涨幅。
在过去的24小时内，有39人感染了该病毒，这是自6月26日（检测到37种感染）以来新病例的最低一日增幅。
尽管如此，挫败感仍然很高，周末有数百人参加了抗议活动，抗议长达数周的冠状病毒封锁。
在一天之内在维多利亚州发现了700多起案件之后，澳大利亚第二大城市在8月初受到严格封锁。
澳大利亚共记录了27,000例新型冠状病毒感染和817例死亡。

SYDNEY (REUTERS) - Australia reported its lowest one-day rise in novel coronavirus infections in nearly three months on Monday (Sept 14) as authorities began to ease restrictions aimed at slowing its spread.
Thirty-nine people were found to be infected with the virus in the past 24 hours, the lowest one-day increase in new cases since June 26, when 37 infections were detected.
Still, frustrations are high, with hundreds of people taking part in protests on the weekend against the weeks-long coronavirus lockdown.
Australia’s second largest city was placed under strict lockdown in early August after more than 700 cases were detected in Victoria state in a single day.
Australia has recorded a total of 27,000 novel coronavirus infections and 817 deaths.
