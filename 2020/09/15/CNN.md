（CNN）根据一个监测小组的数据，美国三大主要城市因大规模野火而冒烟，现在的空气质量是世界上任何大城市中最差的。
根据空气质量指数，西雅图和旧金山的空气充满了烟雾，处于“不健康”的水平。
那里的空气“非常不健康”，这意味着任何吸入空气的人“可能会遭受更严重的健康影响”。
根据追踪全球空气质量的组织IQAir的数据，波特兰，西雅图和旧金山的空气质量是全球任何主要城市中最差的。
但是根据EPA自己的空气质量指数追踪器，大城市以外的情况甚至更糟。

(CNN) Three major US cities being wreathed in smoke from massive wildfires now have the worst air quality of any big cities in the world, according to a monitoring group.
The air is so full of smoke in Seattle and San Francisco, it's at "unhealthy" levels, according to the Air Quality Index.
The air there is "very unhealthy," meaning that anyone breathing it in, "may experience more serious health effects."
According to IQAir, a group which tracks global air quality, Portland, Seattle and San Francisco have the worst air quality of any major cities around the world.
But things are even worse outside of the big cities, according to the EPA's own air quality index trackers.

甲骨文寻求美国批准与短视频应用程序TikTok建立具有里程碑意义的合作伙伴关系时，专家表示，特朗普对甲骨文董事长兼联合创始人拉里·埃里森的政治关系将引发更多质疑。
审查也不限于埃里森；甲骨文CEO Safra Catz也与特朗普保持着密切联系。
根据联邦选举委员会的数据，她已经为特朗普今年的竞选工作捐赠了超过130,000美元。
卡茨于2016年在特朗普的总统过渡小组任职，曾一度被考虑担任政府内部职位。
卡茨（Catz）和埃里森（Ellison）都曾在特朗普致力于经济复兴的行业工作组任职。

As Oracle seeks US approval for a landmark partnership with the short-form video app TikTok, experts say questions will intensify over Trump's political relationship with Oracle chairman and co-founder Larry Ellison.
Nor will the scrutiny be limited to Ellison; Oracle CEO Safra Catz shares close ties with Trump as well.
She has donated more than $130,000 to Trump's reelection efforts this year, according to Federal Election Commission data .
Catz served on Trump's presidential transition team in 2016 and was at one point considered for a position inside the administration.
Both Catz and Ellison have served on Trump's industry working groups devoted to economic revival.

(CNN) An Israeli court sentenced supermodel Bar Refaeli to nine months of community service for tax evasion Sunday, and handed her mother 16 months in prison, concluding a years-long case against the national celebrity.
Refaeli and her mother Zipi, who worked as the star's manager, were convicted in July for failing to report millions of dollars of earnings, nearly five years after the model was first questioned by authorities.
During the hearing, Bar expressed regret for her actions.
"I guarantee you I won't be seen in a court room again after this trial," the 35-year-old said.

（CNN）白俄罗斯总统亚历山大·卢卡申科周一访问了俄罗斯西南部的索契市，与俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京进行了一对一会谈，以寻求俄罗斯在白俄罗斯抗议活动数周后得到支持的保证。
普京在会议上重申，俄罗斯已同意向白俄罗斯提供15亿美元的贷款。
两国总统还讨论了今天在白俄罗斯举行的“斯拉夫兄弟会”联合军事演习，普京说，俄罗斯部队将在训练后返回家园。
而且，普京仅遵守周一的先前承诺，就对白俄罗斯的长期计划了解不多。
对于卢卡申科来说，他的职位固有的弱点意味着他可能需要将对白俄罗斯的更大控制权移交给普京，以换取俄罗斯的支持，使他继续执政。

(CNN) Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko visited Sochi in southwest Russia on Monday for one-on-one talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, seeking reassurances of Russia's support after weeks of protests in Belarus.
In the meeting, Putin reiterated that Russia has agreed to provide Belarus a loan in the region of $1.5 billion.
The two presidents also discussed the "Slavic Brotherhood" joint military drills that kicked off today in Belarus, with Putin saying Russian units will return home after the training.
And by merely sticking to his previous commitments on Monday, Putin has shed little light on his long-term plan for Belarus.
For Lukashenko, the inherent weakness of his position means that he may need to exchange ceding greater control of Belarus to Putin in exchange for Russian support that keeps him in power.

米高梅度假村周一宣布，当米高梅公园和拉斯维加斯NoMad赌场在本月底重新开放时，酒店将组成拉斯维加斯大道上的第一家完全无烟无烟的酒店，包括其赌场。
自拉斯维加斯成立以来，赌场胜地一直是吸烟的代名词，尤其是在游戏场上。
相关内容几家拉斯维加斯酒店正在提供“从维加斯出发的旅行套餐”。“虽然拉斯维加斯以外的许多赌场都是无烟的，但这是拉斯维加斯这种规模的度假胜地的首次开业无烟，”施瓦兹说，他也是拉斯维加斯内华达大学教务副教务长。
斯图兹说，尽管赌场公司在拉斯维加斯大道上尝试了无烟游戏，但他们只是在较小规模上进行了试验。
米高梅国际度假村集团（MGM Resorts International）“对于公园米高梅和NoMad来说，现在由于Covid-19健康和安全准则而出现的时机似乎是正确的，”斯图茨在一封电子邮件中写道。

MGM Resorts announced Monday that when Park MGM and NoMad Las Vegas reopen at the end of the month, the hotels will comprise the first fully smoke- and vape-free -- including its casino -- on the Las Vegas Strip.
Since the early days of Las Vegas, casino resorts have been synonymous with smoking -- especially on the gaming floor.

Stutz said that while casino companies have tried smoke-free gaming on the Las Vegas Strip, they have experimented with it only on a smaller scale.
MGM Resorts International"For Park MGM and NoMad, the timing now due to Covid-19 health and safety guidelines seems right," Stutz wrote in an email.

冠状病毒大流行已经颠覆了传统的跑道形式，取而代之的是虚拟表演，在某些情况下是观众数量有限的物理表演。
纽约时装周（NYFW）首先到达，从9月13日至17日在伦敦，米兰和巴黎举行。
为了广播虚拟事件，美国时装设计师协会（CFDA）创建了Runway360，这是一个数字平台，用于展示新系列或其他创意项目。
数字格式还为新兴设计师提供了在没有所有常规层次结构的情况下闪耀的机会。

The coronavirus pandemic has upended the traditional runway format, and in its place will be a mix of virtual and, in some cases, physical shows with limited audience numbers.
New York Fashion Week (NYFW) arrives first, running from September 13 to 17 ahead of London, Milan and Paris.
To broadcast the virtual events, the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) has created Runway360, a digital platform to show new collections or other creative projects.
The digital format is also giving emerging designers a chance to shine without all the usual hierarchies.

（CNN）去年，凯莉·克拉克森（Kelly Clarkson）的生活似乎过得不错，但现在她在唱另一首歌。
她最近在《今日报》上谈论了事情的进展。
克拉克森说：“我的意思是，我的生活有点像垃圾箱，这已经不是什么秘密了。”
她补充说：“我一直在与经历过离婚的朋友交谈。”
“我不知道人们在没有某种解决方法的情况下如何经历，因为这对所有参与人员来说都是最糟糕的事情。”

(CNN) Life appeared to have been going pretty well for Kelly Clarkson last year, but now she's singing a different tune.
She recently talked to "Today" about how things have been going.
"I mean, it's no secret my life has been a little bit of a dumpster," Clarkson said.
"I've been talking to friends that have been through divorce," she added.
"I don't know how people go through that without having some kind of outlet because it is the worst thing ever for everyone involved."

## 这位享誉世界的冈比亚音乐家正在建立一所学院，以便孩子们可以学习自己的文化-无需离开非洲

“但是为什么非洲人要离开非洲去学习自己的文化呢？
书院的历史乔巴特（Jobarteh）于2015年创立了冈比亚书院（Gambia Academy），向学龄儿童提供与非洲历史，文化和传统音乐一道的主流课程。
该学院从21名学生开始-“象征着科拉的21点，” Jobarteh说-在冈比亚西部乡村小镇法拉托的临时设施中。
该学院还计划邀请国际学生和音乐家进一步提高儿童的教育经验。
该项目已从联合国儿童基金会获得45,000美元，足以在11月开始在青年部的主楼上施工。

"But why should Africans leave Africa to go and study their own culture?
History of the academyJobarteh founded The Gambia Academy in 2015, teaching school-age children a mainstream curriculum alongside African history, culture and traditional music.
The Academy started with 21 students -- "to symbolize the kora's 21-stings," said Jobarteh -- in a makeshift facility in Farato, a rural town in western Gambia.
The academy also plans to invite international students and musicians to further the educational experience of the children.
The project has received $45,000 from UNICEF, enough to begin construction in November on the Junior Department's main building.

## 在为期两年的智能手机睡眠追踪研究中，睡眠不良与体重增加有关

### Poor sleep linked to weight gain in 2-year smartphone sleep tracking study

睡眠与进食之间的联系缺乏睡眠与食欲有科学的道理。
研究表明，当您的睡眠不足时，一种叫做生长素释放肽的激素的水平就会升高，而另一种激素（瘦素）会急剧下降。
达斯古普塔说：“生长素释放肽中的'g'代表增加：这种速效激素会增加饥饿感并导致体重增加。”
我们变胖的另一个原因是由于一个古老的人体系统称为内源性大麻素系统。
在研究中，越来越少与高血压，免疫系统减弱，体重增加，缺乏性欲，情绪波动，妄想症，抑郁症以及罹患糖尿病，中风，心血管疾病，痴呆症和某些癌症的风险较高有关。

Link between sleep and eatingThere is a scientific reason why a lack of sleep is linked to appetite.
When you're sleep deprived, research has shown, levels of a hormone called ghrelin spike while another hormone, leptin, takes a nosedive.
"The 'g' in ghrelin stands for gain: This fast-acting hormone increases hunger and leads to weight gain," Dasgupta said.
Another reason we gain weight is due to an ancient body system called the endocannabinoid system.
Getting less has been linked in studies to high blood pressure, a weakened immune system, weight gain, a lack of libido, mood swings, paranoia, depression and a higher risk of diabetes, stroke, cardiovascular disease, dementia and some cancers.

每个地点都是独一无二的，但斯坦因茨注意到了一个共同的主题-人类正在改变地球。
在2018年《纽约时报》杂志派遣他到各个大洲记录气候变化之后，斯坦因茨决定整理一本书，收集他整个职业生涯的图像。
“人类星球”记载了我们对环境的影响以及为保护环境而提出的解决方案。
偶然的环保主义者这种对世界的鸟瞰图使Steinmetz能够见证并记录人类改变地球的方式。
这位摄影师说他不打算记录气候变化，但是他的作品档案使人类的足迹不可否认。

Each location was unique, but the Steinmetz noticed a common theme -- humans were changing the planet.
After a 2018 New York Times Magazine assignment that sent him to every continent to document climate change, Steinmetz decided to put together a book, collecting images spanning his whole career.
"Human Planet" chronicles our impact on the environment and the solutions we have come up with to try to save it.
The accidental environmentalistThis bird's-eye view of the world allowed Steinmetz to witness -- and document -- the ways humans have changed the planet.
The photographer says he didn't intend to document climate change, but his archive of work made humanity's footprint undeniable.

## 画飞机：为什么每一层都很重要

### Painting an airplane: Why every layer counts

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-当通过吸引人的飞机制服吸引公众注意时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常是白色，但并不总是白色（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板可以应用最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，合并和收购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
