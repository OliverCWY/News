Washington (CNN) Samantha Cohen, the daughter of President Donald Trump's former lawyer, says she was taken aback by his behavior toward her father during a 2012 incident in which her father says Trump leered at her.

"Trump's attention was diverted to another skirt walking off a tennis court. 'Look at that piece of a--,' Cohen recalls Trump saying, as he whistled and pointed," according to Vanity Fair. "'I would love some of that.' It so happened that Trump was referring to Cohen's then 15-year-old daughter, Samantha."

"Cohen informed Trump of his mistake. 'That's your daughter?' Trump responded. 'When did she get so hot?' When Samantha reached her dad, Trump asked her for a kiss on the cheek, before inquiring, 'When did you get such a beautiful figure?' and warning her that in a few years, he would be dating one of her friends," the magazine reported.

Asked about the alleged incident by CNN's Alisyn Camerota on "New Day" on Monday, Samantha Cohen said it's "a little bit less clear to me" because she's become "desensitized to men making these kinds of comments," adding that she remembered "insulting" comments Trump made toward her father during the episode.
