Washington (Cnn Business) President Donald Trump last month used his office to ignite an international business crisis that's plunged into doubt the future of one of the world's most popular social media platforms — a decision that's now led to the apparent benefit of a major political backer.

As Oracle seeks US approval for a landmark partnership with the short-form video app TikTok, experts say questions will intensify over Trump's political relationship with Oracle chairman and co-founder Larry Ellison.

One of the richest men in the world, Ellison has built extensive bridges with Trump. He has vocally expressed support for the President and reportedly hosted a major fundraiser for him this year where donors who paid $100,000 were offered a chance to golf with Trump.

Nor will the scrutiny be limited to Ellison; Oracle CEO Safra Catz shares close ties with Trump as well. She has donated more than $130,000 to Trump's reelection efforts this year, according to Federal Election Commission data . Catz served on Trump's presidential transition team in 2016 and was at one point considered for a position inside the administration. Both Catz and Ellison have served on Trump's industry working groups devoted to economic revival.

Oracle didn't respond to requests for comment. The White House declined to comment.
