但是，在这种重演中丢失的是，人们普遍认为武汉的湿货市场对该流行病为零。
“这确实是中国领先武汉的湿润市场引发这场危机的唯一出路。”
甚至上班的好处值得怀疑。”现年51岁的易新华女士说。她在武汉湿市场的摊位上卖豆腐。

Lost in this retelling, however, is that a wet market in Wuhan is widely believed to be ground zero for the pandemic.
"That's really the only way China can come out ahead of the idea that a wet market in Wuhan started this crisis."
The benefit of even coming to work is questionable," said Madam Yi Xinhua, 51, who sells tofu from her stall at a Wuhan wet market.

彭亨州劳布-在马来西亚彭亨州内部深处的山麓小丘上，痛苦的争斗使一大批无牌农民和彭亨皇室拥有的一家新公司陷入了该国著名的Musang King榴莲的困境。

RAUB, PAHANG - At foothills deep in the interior of Malaysia's Pahang state, a bitter tussle is pitting a large group of unlicensed farmers and a new company owned by Pahang royalty over the country's famous Musang King durians.
A key RPD proposal is a promise to buy Musang King durians at a fixed price of RM30 (S$9.85) per kilo from the farmers.
The hills beyond Sungai Klau where the Musang King durians are planted at high altitude.
In the 1990s, they discovered the Musang King variant, which can sell today for as much as RM55 a kilo.
This area now accounts for 60 per cent of all Musang King exports from Malaysia.

北京（路透社）-该公司首席执行官周日（9月6日）说，约有90％的Sinovac Biotech员工及其家人已经服用了该公司根据该国紧急使用计划开发的一种实验性冠状病毒疫苗。
该计划针对特定人群，包括医务人员以及在食品市场以及运输和服务部门工作的人员。
殷先生在北京举行的一次国际贸易展览会期间说：“作为疫苗的开发者和制造商，新的爆发可能直接影响我们的疫苗生产。”他解释了为何将他的公司包括在紧急计划中。
他说，那些选择接种疫苗的人，包括他的妻子和父母，在拍摄之前已被告知可能的副作用。
没有一种疫苗通过最终的大规模试验来证明它是有效和安全的，足以保护人们免受这种病毒的感染，该病毒在全球已导致870,000多人死亡。

BEIJING (REUTERS) - About 90 per cent of Sinovac Biotech employees and their families have taken an experimental coronavirus vaccine developed by the Chinese firm under the country's emergency use programme, its chief executive said on Sunday (Sept 6).
The programme is intended for specific groups, including medical staff and those who work at food markets and in the transportation and service sectors.
"As a vaccine developer and manufacturer, a new outbreak could directly impact our vaccine production," Mr Yin said on the sidelines of an international trade fair in Beijing, explaining why his company was included in the emergency programme.
He said those who chose to be inoculated, including his wife and parents, had been informed of the potential side effects prior to taking the shot.
No vaccine has passed final, large-scale trials to prove it is effective and safe enough to protect people against the virus that has led to over 870,000 deaths globally.

彭博社周日报道说，特朗普随后利用空闲时间选择艺术品，将其从美国大使官邸中移走并送回白宫。
白宫代表没有对彭博社的报道立即发表评论，彭博社的报道援引了几位熟悉这一事件的人的话。
民主党前副总统乔·拜登（Joe Biden）在11月3日的总统大选中向特朗普提出挑战，他称特朗普对阵亡士兵的评论“真可耻”。
财政部长史蒂文·姆努钦（Steven Mnuchin）也支持特朗普对军方的支持。
姆努钦在白宫对记者说：“总统一直100％支持军队。”

Bloomberg reported on Sunday that Mr Trump subsequently spent the free time selecting artwork to remove from the US ambassador's residence and send back to the White House.
Representatives for the White House had no immediate comment on the Bloomberg report, which cited several people familiar with the episode.
Democratic former vice-president Joe Biden, who is challenging Mr Trump in the Nov 3 presidential election, called Mr Trump's comments about the fallen soldiers "a disgrace" if true.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also backed Mr Trump's support of the military.
"The President has always been 100 per cent supportive of the military," Mr Mnuchin told reporters at the White House.
