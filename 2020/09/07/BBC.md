约翰逊先生将说，在没有贸易协议的情况下完成英国从欧盟的退出仍然是一个“好结果”。
尽管英国于1月31日离开欧盟，但在谈判贸易协定时，英国仍遵循一些欧盟规定。
预计约翰逊会说：“我们现在正在进入与欧盟谈判的最后阶段。”
但是约翰逊先生会说，无交易意味着要使用世界贸易组织（WTO）制定的贸易协议，与澳大利亚达成与欧盟的贸易安排。
约翰逊先生将说：“随时准备谈谈。”“我们将完全控制我们的法律，我们的规则和我们的捕鱼水域。”

Mr Johnson will say completing the UK's exit from the EU without a trade deal would still be a "good outcome".
Although the UK left the EU on 31 January, it continues to follow some EU rules while the trade agreement is being negotiated.
"We are now entering the final phase of our negotiations with the EU," Mr Johnson is expected to say.
But Mr Johnson will say no-deal means having a "trading arrangement with the EU like Australia's", using trade protocols set by the World Trade Organisation.
'Always ready to talk'"We will have full control over our laws, our rules, and our fishing waters," Mr Johnson will say.

## 薇薇安·迈耶（Vivian Maier）：把自己藏起来的难以捉摸的天才

即使是在摆姿势的照片中，Maier的表情也始终无法被破译：她似乎在敢于让我们准确猜出她在想什么-也许是敢于自己。
1978年7月，她在芝加哥的车站平台上拍摄了一张特别吸引人的照片，面对粘贴在墙上的一系列电影海报。
我们所看到的只是在框架左侧隐约可见的戴着帽子，手抓包的影子：比附近的大白鲨的广告更具威胁性。
研究人员对她的档案进行梳理表明，考虑到那些了解她的人记忆犹新，她比我们想象的要世俗得多，而且在政治上参与度更高。
是的，从这个故事中出现的Maier有点古怪-她似乎在以后的生活中患有精神疾病-但也强烈地意识到自己的才华。

Even in the posed pictures, Maier’s expression is invariably impossible to decipher: she seems to be daring us to guess exactly what she’s thinking – or, perhaps, daring herself.
She took one particularly droll photograph on a station platform in Chicago in July 1978, facing towards a line of movie posters pasted to the wall.
All we see of her is a hat-wearing, hand-bag-clutching shadow looming at the left of the frame: far more menacing than the advert for Jaws nearby.
Researchers combing through her archive have demonstrated that she was a far worldlier – and more politically engaged – person than we might expect, given how reclusive those who knew her remember.
Yes, the Maier who emerges from this account was somewhat eccentric – she appears to have struggled with mental illness later in life – but was also powerfully aware of her own talent.
