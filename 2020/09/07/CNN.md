周日，他以线击中线裁判时拖欠1分。
在对阵西班牙的巴勃罗·卡雷诺·布斯塔（Pablo Carreno Busta）的第一场比赛中，塞尔维亚人就被打破，以6-5落后，当时他在球场上击中了身后的一球。
德约科维奇本来不会瞄准任何人，但它击中了巡线裁判-似乎靠近他的脸-她倒在了地上。
随后，德约科维奇与弗里梅尔（Friemel）进行了广泛的对话，之后他被正式拖欠。
塞尔维亚的诺瓦克·德约科维奇（Novak Djokovic）倾向于一名线下裁判，他在9月6日星期日的2020年美国公开赛与西班牙选手巴勃罗·卡雷诺·布斯塔（Pablo Carreno Busta）的男单比赛中被击中。

1 was defaulted Sunday when he struck a line judge with a ball.
The Serb had just been broken to trail 6-5 in the first set against Spain's Pablo Carreno Busta when he hit a ball behind him on the court.
Djokovic wouldn't have been aiming at anyone but it hit the line judge -- seemingly near the face -- and she fell to the ground.
Djokovic then had an extended conversation with Friemel before he was officially defaulted.
Novak Djokovic of Serbia tends to a line judge who was hit with the ball during his men's singles match against Pablo Carreno Busta of Spain at the 2020 US Open on Sunday, September 6.

（CNN）根据白俄罗斯协调委员会的声明，一名白俄罗斯激进分子已被安全部队从东欧国家驱逐出境。
该组织的一份声明说，白俄罗斯主要反对派候选人斯维特兰娜·蒂哈诺夫斯卡娅（Svetlana Tikhanovskaya）的知己奥尔加·科尔瓦科娃（Olga Kolvakova）于星期六晚上被从该国撤职。
声明说：“ 9月5日晚上，白俄罗斯特种部队将斯维特兰娜·蒂哈诺夫斯卡娅（Svetlana Tikhanovskaya）的知己奥尔加·科尔瓦科娃（Olga Kolvakova）带到白俄罗斯-波兰边境，并将其释放到无人区。”
奥尔加·科瓦尔科娃（Olga Kovalkova）被安全服务人员掩盖，坐在汽车上，开车去了波兰边境，并在那里被释放。
根据理事会，向科尔瓦科娃提供了两种选择：可以将她带出该国，或者将她拘留在白俄罗斯，并进一步增加其刑期。

(CNN) A Belarusian activist has been ejected from the eastern European country by security forces, according to a statement from the Belarusian Coordination Council.
Olga Kolvakova, a confidant of the main Belarusian opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, was removed from the country on Saturday night, according to a statement from the organization.
"On the night of September 5, the Belarusian special services took Olga Kolvakova, a confidant of Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, to the Belarusian-Polish border and released her to a no-man's land," the statement said.
Olga Kovalkova was masked by security service members, placed in a car and driven to the Polish border, where she was released.
According to the council, Kolvakova was offered two choices: She could be taken out of the country or she would be kept in custody in Belarus, with further terms of imprisonment constantly added to her sentence.

（CNN）成千上万人已经撤离了一场强大的台风，预计该台风将在周日登陆日本西南部。
这是一周内第二次袭击该地区的风暴。
台风迈萨克（Maysak）-相当于时速至少130英里/小时的四级飓风-沿着与海神相似的路径走。
周日，海神袭击了日本西南沿海的琉球群岛，给该地区带来了狂风和大雨，并给数千家房屋供电。
预计风暴将继续向北移动，并在接下来的36小时内影响朝鲜半岛。

(CNN) Hundreds of thousands of people have been evacuated out of the path of a powerful typhoon that's expected to make landfall in southwestern Japan on Sunday.
It's the second powerful storm to hit the region in a week.
Typhoon Maysak -- the equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane with winds of at least 130 mph -- followed a similar path to Haishen.
Haishen hit the Ryukyu Islands off Japan's southwestern coast on Sunday, bringing strong winds and heavy rain to the region and knocking out power to thousands of homes.
The storm is then expected to continue on its path north and impact the Korean Peninsula in the next 36 hours.

黎巴嫩贝鲁特（CNN）经过三天的搜寻后，救援人员未能在贝鲁特的瓦砾山下找到幸存者，扑灭了在爆炸摧毁该市一个月后找到失踪人员的希望。
周六晚上，当地人称赞搜救工作完成了95％，并排除了生命迹象，在智利搜救队的带领下，为救援人员鼓掌。
智利救援队Topos负责人Francisco Lermanda在新闻发布会上对记者说：“不幸的是，今天，我们可以说建筑物内没有生命迹象。”
智利团队Topos周四表示，他们的搜寻犬和传感器在贝鲁特东部一栋被毁建筑物的废墟中发现了生命迹象。
救援人员返回搜查一栋被摧毁的建筑物，目的是在2020年9月4日黎巴嫩贝鲁特爆炸发生后寻找潜在的幸存者。

Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) Rescuers have failed to find a survivor under a mountain of rubble in Beirut after a three-day search, extinguishing hopes of locating a missing person a month after a blast devastated the city.
On Saturday evening, locals applauded the rescue workers, led by a Chilean search and rescue team, after they announced that the search was 95% complete and that they were ruling out signs of life.
"Unfortunately, today, we can say there's no sign of life inside of the building," Francisco Lermanda, the head of Topos, a Chilean rescue team, told reporters at a news conference.
The Chilean team, Topos, on Thursday said their search dog and sensors had detected signs of life in the rubble of a destroyed building in eastern Beirut.
Rescue workers return to search a destroyed building with the aim of finding a potential survivor in the aftermath of the Beirut blast on September 4, 2020 in Beirut, Lebanon.

（CNN）-星期六，一名奥地利男子在装满冰块的水箱中呆了两个多小时-都是以创造新的世界纪录的名义。
Koeberl说，他承担了这项挑战，这项挑战使用了1800公斤冰，以提高人们对气候变化的认识。
当我在高山高地上进行大量训练时，我想提高人们对冰川融化的认识，”他告诉CNN。
这位现年43岁的奥地利人告诉CNN，这次他持续了两个小时，三十分钟和53秒，并希望在未来的几天里，他的尝试将获得世界纪录。
Koeberl告诉CNN，如果他能找到合适的位置应对挑战，他希望明年能再创纪录。

(CNN) — An Austrian man spent more than two hours in a tank packed to the brim with ice cubes on Saturday -- all in the name of setting a new world record.
Koeberl said he undertook the challenge, which used 1800kg of ice, to raise awareness of climate change.
As I train a lot in high alpine terrain, I want to raise awareness on the melting of the glaciers," he told CNN.
The 43-year-old Austrian told CNN that this time, he lasted for two hours, 30 minutes and 53 seconds, and hopes that in the coming days his attempt will be approved as a world record.
Koeberl told CNN he hopes to attempt to push the record further next year, if he could find a suitable location for the challenge.

拉德纳和他的朋友德里克·斯蒂格莱特（Derek Stiglet）于8月29日追逐一只7英尺长的鳄鱼，但没想到会发现更大的东西。
但是，当他们在沼泽的裂隙中迷路时，他们开始追逐其他东西。
“我的朋友在船的前部……只看到鳄鱼的眼睛说：'它在那边！'

Ladner and his friend, Derek Stiglet, were chasing a seven-foot alligator on August 29 and didn't expect to find something much bigger.
However, when they lost the trail at a split in the marsh, they started chasing something else.
"My buddy was on the front of the boat ... and just saw a gator eye and said, 'It's over there\!'
... when we hooked it we thought it was a log because it wasn't moving like an alligator would."

Big Lots BIG是一家在美国拥有1400多家门店的零售商，近年来销售额停滞不前，但在最近一个季度实现了创纪录的销售额增长，赢得了竞争对手的市场份额。
家具是Big Lots最大的业务。
分析师说，这些种类繁多的物品有助于Big Lots与传统的家居装饰和家具销售商以及杂货商区分开。
Big Lots还提供清仓商品，当制造商生产过多的物品或中断生产线时，便会从制造商那里获取这些商品。
Big Lots商店的平均面积为25,000平方英尺，比典型的超市要小一些。

Big Lots BIG , a retailer with more than 1,400 US stores, saw sales stagnate in recent years but experienced record sales growth during its most recent quarter, gaining market share from rivals.
Furniture is Big Lots' biggest business.
This broad range of items helps Big Lots distinguish itself from traditional home decor and furniture sellers, as well as grocers, analysts say.
Big Lots also offers closeout merchandise, which it scoops up from manufacturers when they produce too much of an item or discontinue a line.
At an average of 25,000 square feet, Big Lots stores are a little smaller than a typical supermarket.

（CNN）-研究人员已经成功进行了飞行V型首飞，这是一种未来派且省油的飞机，有一天可以在机翼上载运乘客。
专家测试了由荷兰代尔夫特理工大学的研究人员和合作伙伴荷兰航空公司KLM开发的22.5公斤，3米比例的未来飞机模型，以将备受期待的飞机用于下一步的开发步骤。
“该小组优化了比例飞行模型，以防止出现这种情况，但布丁的证明来自饮食。
他们指出，研究人员通过远程控制飞机，以80 kmh的速度起飞，而飞机的飞行速度，角度和推力均按计划进行。
专家们努力优化飞机：为了改善遥测，团队被迫改变飞机的重心并调整其天线。

(CNN) — Researchers have conducted a successful maiden flight of the Flying-V , a futuristic and fuel efficient airplane that could one day carry passengers in its wings.
Experts tested a 22.5 kg and 3-meter scale model of the futuristic airplane, developed by researchers at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands and partner Dutch airline KLM, to take the highly anticipated aircraft along its next developmental steps.
"The team optimized the scaled flight model to prevent the issue but the proof of the pudding is in the eating.
Remotely controlling the aircraft, researchers managed take off at a speed of 80 kmh, while the aircraft's flight speeds, angles and thrust were as planned, they noted.
Experts worked hard to optimize the plane: in order to improve telemetry, the team was forced to change the aircraft's center of gravity and adjust its antenna.

亚马尔陨石坑是该地区发现的第一个大洞。
爆炸全部喷出了地冰，在某些情况下，这还留下了孔，巨大的冰冻块落在了表面上。
Bogoyavlensky不相信这些火山口的主要原因是与气候变化有关的温度升高。
同样，纳塔利（Natali）说，她相信气候变化会发挥作用-尽管还需要更多数据来明确说明。
这些漏洞很少，因此可以肯定地说，这很棘手，但我非常相信气候变化在其中发挥了作用。”

The Yamal Crater was the first of these massive holes to be discovered in the region.
The explosions all ejected ground ice, which in some cases leaves holes where huge frozen blocks have fallen on the surface.
Bogoyavlensky isn't convinced that the primary cause of these craters is warming temperatures linked to climate change.
Likewise, Natali said she believed climate change plays a role -- although more data is needed to say definitively.
There's so few of these holes so it might be tricky to say for certain, but I'm pretty confident climate change is playing a role in this."

每个地点都是独一无二的，但斯坦因茨注意到了一个共同的主题-人类正在改变地球。
在2018年《纽约时报》（New York Times）杂志派遣他到各个大洲记录气候变化之后，斯坦梅茨决定整理一本书，收集他整个职业生涯的图像。
“人类星球”记载了我们对环境的影响以及为保护环境而提出的解决方案。
偶然的环保主义者这种对世界的鸟瞰图使Steinmetz能够见证并记录人类改变地球的方式。
这位摄影师说他不打算记录气候变化，但他的工作档案使人类的足迹不可否认。

Each location was unique, but the Steinmetz noticed a common theme -- humans were changing the planet.
After a 2018 New York Times Magazine assignment that sent him to every continent to document climate change, Steinmetz decided to put together a book, collecting images spanning his whole career.
"Human Planet" chronicles our impact on the environment and the solutions we have come up with to try to save it.
The accidental environmentalistThis bird's-eye view of the world allowed Steinmetz to witness -- and document -- the ways humans have changed the planet.
The photographer says he didn't intend to document climate change, but his archive of work made humanity's footprint undeniable.

## 画飞机：为什么每一层都很重要

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-通过吸引人的飞机制服吸引公众注意力时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常为白色，但并非总是如此（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板应用了最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，合并和收购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
