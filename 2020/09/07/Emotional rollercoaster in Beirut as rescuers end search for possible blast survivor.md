Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) Rescuers have failed to find a survivor under a mountain of rubble in Beirut after a three-day search, extinguishing hopes of locating a missing person a month after a blast devastated the city.

On Saturday evening, locals applauded the rescue workers, led by a Chilean search and rescue team, after they announced that the search was 95% complete and that they were ruling out signs of life. "Unfortunately, today, we can say there's no sign of life inside of the building," Francisco Lermanda, the head of Topos, a Chilean rescue team, told reporters at a news conference.

For three days, people across Lebanon were glued to their TV screens, anticipating news of a possible survivor in the Mar Mikhaeal near the epicenter of the August 4 blast. The Chilean team, Topos, on Thursday said their search dog and sensors had detected signs of life in the rubble of a destroyed building in eastern Beirut. It was an announcement that drew crowds of volunteers, solidarity demonstrators as well as local and international press coverage.

Rescue workers return to search a destroyed building with the aim of finding a potential survivor in the aftermath of the Beirut blast on September 4, 2020 in Beirut, Lebanon.

Many said it was not the happy ending they were hoping for, but others argued that the outcome was ideal. "It was a happy ending," said Melissa Fathallah, an activist and founder of Baytna Baytak, an initiative to house Lebanese health workers during the Covid-19 crisis. "Did we really want to add another name to the list of people who unfortunately died in this? I look at it as a positive thing because we didn't have to add one more name. We didn't have to find another missing person."

Fathallah initially went to the site of the search operation on Thursday to protest against a Lebanese military decision to temporarily suspend the mission. She later became a volunteer in the rescue effort after the military later retracted the decision and invited some of the protesters, including Fathallah, to join the operation.
