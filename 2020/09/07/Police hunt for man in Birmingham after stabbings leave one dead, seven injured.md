BIRMINGHAM (REUTERS, AFP) - Police said they were searching for a man in relation to a two-hour stabbing spree in the city of Birmingham, central England, early on Sunday (Sept 6), that left one man dead and seven people injured, two of them critically.

The knife attacks happened in four locations in the city centre starting from 00:30 (7:30am Singapore time), police said.

“We are treating all four of those incidents as a linked series,” West Midlands Police Chief Superintendent Steve Graham said. “We are searching for one suspect and inquiries to identify and then trace that suspect are ongoing.”

He said there was no suggestion that the attacks were targeted at any section of the community or were gang related.

“At this stage we can’t find a particular motive, but it does appear to be random in terms of the selection of people who were attacked,” he said.

Britain’s Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he had no information to indicate the incidents were terrorism related but the public should stay “very vigilant”.

The first stabbing was in Constitution Hill, police said, and the suspect then moved from north to south, to Livery Street, Irving Street and ending at Hurst Street.

The final location is an area known as the city’s Gay Village, where people had been seated at outdoor tables eating and drinking.

A knife was visible to a Reuters witness beside a drain in Edmund Street, near to the second location. Graham said it was “way too early” to say if the knife was connected to the incident.

The incident comes after several previous mass casualty stabbings, including one in the Scottish city of Glasgow on June 26, in which six people were injured, including a police officer.

A man was charged with murder after three people were killed in a park in Reading, west of London, the previous week in an attack investigated by counter-terrorism police.

Britain has been on high alert after two mass stabbings in London in the past year, which saw both perpetrators – convicted extremists released early from prison – shot dead by armed officers.

Knife crime in England and Wales increased six per cent in the year to the end of March, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Birmingham, one of Britain’s most ethnically diverse cities with a population of more than one million, has had an explosive recent history of gang violence.

In January 2003, one gang opened fire with an illegal semi-automatic sub-machine gun at a rival group. Two teenage girls who were bystanders were killed in the hail of bullets.

‘GROUPS UPON GROUPS’

Cara Curran, a nightclub promoter who was working at the Arcadian Centre on Saturday night said she saw “groups upon groups” of people fighting in and around the venue and heard the use of “racial slurs”.

“I had seen a lot of tensions building through the night, which wasn’t quite like what I’ve seen before,” she told Agence France-Presse.

“I had left with my boyfriend. I heard a commotion and saw multiple police coming towards our direction. I headed towards where I saw them coming and it all just unfurled in front of me.

“It was quite a street fight. It didn’t really look like fighting. It was just multiple people on top of each other, not one on one.”

She added: “There was every ethnicity there, there was Asian, Black, White. It wasn’t just this ethnicity against this ethnicity, it was a group of ethnicities with another group, and they sort of just went at it.”

Passers-by fled the violence, as police and other emergency services arrived quickly and cordoned off the area. Forensic specialists were poring over the scene mid-morning.

SOCIAL EXCLUSION

Shabana Mahmood, who represents the area in the UK parliament for the main opposition Labour Party, described the events as “deeply concerning”.

Local councillor Yvonne Mosquito, also of Labour, said the violence was “traumatic” for everyone involved. Mosquito, a former city lord mayor, praised police for tackling so-called “black on black” violence in Birmingham in the early 2000s.

But she said there remained a real issue with social exclusion among younger people, including “county lines” drug dealing.

The Arcadian centre, where Birmingham Gay Village and Chinese Quarter meet, was vibrant and popular although there had been “a bit of trouble” previously, she told AFP.

“Work is still going on to establish what has happened, and could take some time before we are in a position to confirm anything,” West Midlands Police added. “At this early stage it would not be appropriate to speculate on the causes of the incident.”
