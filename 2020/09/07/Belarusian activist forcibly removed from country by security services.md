(CNN) A Belarusian activist has been ejected from the eastern European country by security forces, according to a statement from the Belarusian Coordination Council.

Olga Kolvakova, a confidant of the main Belarusian opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, was removed from the country on Saturday night, according to a statement from the organization.

The council is a body aimed at coordinating a peaceful and orderly transition of power and was established by Tikhanovskaya following Belarus' disputed August elections.

"On the night of September 5, the Belarusian special services took Olga Kolvakova, a confidant of Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, to the Belarusian-Polish border and released her to a no-man's land," the statement said.

Olga Kovalkova was masked by security service members, placed in a car and driven to the Polish border, where she was released.

According to the council, Kolvakova was offered two choices: She could be taken out of the country or she would be kept in custody in Belarus, with further terms of imprisonment constantly added to her sentence.
