周一，印度新德里（CNN）指责中国军队在喜马拉雅山有争议的边境高处附近采取“挑衅性”行动，违反了此前两个旨在缓解该地区紧张局势的核武对手之间的协议。
印度的指控是在两个半月前发生的。沿边界发生的流血冲突造成至少20名印度士兵死亡。
自拉达克东部加尔万河谷冲突以来，中印军事指挥官之间的高层会议有助于平息事实上的边境线，即所谓的实际控制线（LAC）。
印度国防部在一份声明中说，中国人民解放军“进行挑衅性的军事运动以改变现状”，“违反了在东部拉达克持续僵持期间在军事和外交交战中达成的先前共识。”
声明说，印度军队先发制人地阻止了中国在班公错湖南岸的军事活动，并采取措施加强其立场，并“阻止中国单方面改变实地的意图”。

New Delhi (CNN) India on Monday accused Chinese troops of taking "provocative" actions near a disputed border high in the Himalayas, violating previous deals between the two nuclear-armed rivals intended to ease tensions in the region.
The Indian allegations come two-and-a-half months after a bloody clash along the border left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead.
High-level meetings between Chinese and Indian military commanders since the Galwan Valley clash, in Eastern Ladakh, had helped to calm the situation along the de-facto border, known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC).
A statement by India's Defense Ministry said China's Peoples Liberation Army "carried out provocative military movements to change the status quo" and "violated the previous consensus arrived at during military and diplomatic engagements during the ongoing standoff in Eastern Ladakh."
The statement said that Indian troops preempted Chinese military activity on the southern bank of Pangong Tso Lake and undertook measures to strengthen their positions and "thwart Chinese intentions to unilaterally change facts on the ground."

## 上诉法院否认迈克尔·弗林和司法部为结束他的案件所做的努力

（CNN）联邦上诉法院周一对迈克尔·弗林（Michael Flynn）和司法部（Justice Department）的请求作出了裁决，要求他们迅速结案。
弗林曾与地方法院法官埃米特·沙利文（Emmet Sullivan）做出决定，要求其聘请第三方律师反对司法部对此案的开除，以及他举行听证会的计划，但尚未发生。
以前，华盛顿特区巡回上诉法院的三名法官组成的小组以2-1支持弗林，命令下级法院审理他的案子。
最近几个月，弗林的案件已成为唐纳德·特朗普总统及其支持者对俄罗斯调查的批评的管道。
另外，该案还导致法律界许多人公开反对巴尔对总统之友的宽大处理，称他在弗林案中的决定扭曲了法律，在政治上帮助特朗普。

(CNN) A federal appeals court ruled Monday against Michael Flynn and the Justice Department in their request to quickly shut down his criminal case.
Flynn had fought District Judge Emmet Sullivan's decision to ask a third-party lawyer to argue against the Justice Department's dismissal in the case, and his plans to hold a hearing, which has not yet happened.
Previously, a group of three judges on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals court sided 2-1 with Flynn in ordering the lower court to toss his case.
In recent months, Flynn's case has become a conduit for President Donald Trump and his supporters' criticism of the Russia investigation.
Separately, the case has led many in the legal industry to publicly oppose Barr's leniency toward friends of the President, saying his decision in the Flynn case twisted the law to help Trump politically.

（CNN）-一名27岁的法国妇女因在印度恒河上的一座圣桥上制作自己的裸体视频而被捕。
该名女子仅为玛丽·海伦（Marie-Helene），8月27日在印度北部的北阿坎德邦被当地印度警察逮捕。
高级警官萨克拉尼（R. K. Saklani）告诉美国有线电视新闻网（CNN），被告拍摄了该材料，以促进其珠宝业务。
“她在拉克什曼·朱拉（Lakshman Jhula）拍摄了视频-这被认为是圣洁的桥梁。
Saklani告诉CNN，该视频中的女人从披肩开始，但在拍摄过程中掉下了披肩，并裸体回到了相机。

(CNN) — A 27-year-old Frenchwoman has been arrested for making a nude video of herself on a holy bridge over India's Ganges River.
The woman, identified only as Marie-Helene, was apprehended on August 27 by local Indian police in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand.
Senior police officer R. K. Saklani told CNN that the accused filmed the material in order to promote her jewelry business.
"She shot the video at Lakshman Jhula -- it is considered a holy bridge.
Saklani told CNN that in the video the woman begins by wearing a shawl, but drops it midway through filming, and appears nude with her back to the camera.

（CNN）这只狗会唱歌...或者至少会唱歌。
新几内亚唱歌犬是一种极为稀有的犬种，以其独特的吠声和how叫声而闻名-它能够发出与座头鲸的叫声相提并论的谐音。
只有大约200只圈养唱歌的狗生活在保护中心或动物园，这是1970年代捕获的一些野狗的后代。
直到2016年，在他们的自然栖息地中都没有发现任何动物，直到2016年，一次探险队在印度尼西亚的新几内亚西部偏远的高地，即巴布亚，发现并研究了15只野狗。
一项新的探险队于2018年返回研究地点，以收集详细的生物学样本，以确认这些高地野狗是否真的是唱歌狗的前身。

(CNN) This dog can sing ... or at least it can yodel.
The New Guinea singing dog, an extremely rare breed, is best known for its unique barks and howls -- it's able to make harmonic sounds that have been compared to the calls of a humpback whale.
Only around 200 captive singing dogs live in conservation centers or zoos, the descendants of a few wild dogs captured in the 1970s.
None had been seen in their natural habitat for half a century until 2016, when an expedition located and studied 15 wild dogs in the remote highlands of the western side of New Guinea, known as Papua, in Indonesia.
A new expedition returned to the study site in 2018 to collect detailed biological samples to confirm whether these highland wild dogs truly are the predecessors of the singing dogs.

（CNN）约翰·汤普森（John Thompson Jr.）是第一位赢得NCAA全国冠军的黑人篮球主教练，据他的家人说，他于周日晚上在弗吉尼亚州阿灵顿的家中去世。

汤普森（Thompson）在乔治敦大学（Georgetown University）执教了27年，带领霍亚人（Hoyas）在1984年获得了唯一的头衔。
后来他谈到要被选为第一个赢得国家冠军的非洲裔美国主教练。

Thompson coached at Georgetown University for 27 years, leading the Hoyas to their lone title in 1984.
He later spoke about being singled out as the first African American head coach to win the National Championship.

（CNN）纽约市已经与Layleen Cubilette-Polanco的家人达成和解，金额为590万美元，因为她在2019年6月在Rikers Island拘留期间去世。
她的家人此前告诉美国有线电视新闻网，该变性妇女于2019年4月被捕并因无法负担500美元的保释金而被送往监狱。
民权组织说，波兰尼科（Polanco）的死代表了一系列因素，可以将有色人种困在司法系统中，尤其是有色人种的变性妇女，其后果是毁灭性的。
她的去世也使人们对现金保释和审前拘留的危险性重新开始了讨论，引发了人们对纽约最近的保释改革法律是否可以挽救她的疑问。
该解决方案最初由The City报告。

(CNN) The City of New York has reached a settlement with the family of Layleen Cubilette-Polanco for $5.9 million following her June 2019 death while in custody on Rikers Island.
The transgender woman was arrested in April 2019 and sent to the jail complex because she could not afford $500 bail, her family previously told CNN.
Civil rights groups say Polanco's death represents a web of factors that can trap people of color in the justice system -- especially transgender women of color -- with devastating outcomes.
Her death also renewed conversation about the perils of cash bail and pretrial detention , raising questions about whether New York's recent bail reform laws could have saved her.
The settlement was first reported by The City.

纽约（CNN商业）不久前，航空公司每年就带来数十亿美元的变更费，每趟航班的最高收费可能高达每人200美元。
两家公司都在周一下午宣布，他们还将永久性地降低大部分变更费。
美国第四大航空公司西南航空公司（LUV）从未收取过零钱。
在整个行业范围内，2019年的变更费为航空公司带来了28亿美元的收入。
“现在，（变更费用的结束）这使人们有信心可以预订，取消和重新预订。”

New York (CNN Business) It wasn't long ago that airlines were bringing in billions of dollars a year in change fees that could range up to $200 per person per flight.
Both announced Monday afternoon that they would permanently drop most change fees as well.
Southwest LUV , the fourth largest US airline, has never had change fees.
Industrywide, change fees netted airlines $2.8 billion in 2019.
"Now, [the end of change fees] this gives people confidence they can book, cancel and rebook."

The event would have taken place August 30 and 31, but is entirely virtual this year because of the coronavirus pandemicThe singer was quickly accused of cultural appropriation by some users for the hairstyle and top.

纽约（CNN商业版）麦当劳（McDonald's）并没有从其前首席执行官史蒂夫·伊斯特布鲁克（Steve Easterbrook）那里收回数百万美元的遣散费的努力中退缩。
这家快餐业巨头周一在一份法庭文件中表示，伊斯特布鲁克驳回该公司针对他的诉讼的动议应予以拒绝。
该公司在周一通过电子邮件发送给CNN Business的一份声明中说：“当麦当劳接受调查时，史蒂夫·伊斯特布鲁克就说谎了。”
“他的论点是道德上已经破产，并且依法行事。
伊斯特布鲁克的律师没有立即回应置评请求。

New York (CNN Business) McDonald's isn't backing down from its push to claw back millions of dollars in severance pay from its former CEO, Steve Easterbrook.
The fast-food giant said in a court filing Monday that Easterbrook's motion to dismiss the company's lawsuit against him should be denied.
"When McDonald's investigated, Steve Easterbrook lied," the company said in a statement emailed to CNN Business Monday.
"His argument that he should not be held responsible for even repeated bad acts is morally bankrupt and fails under the law."
Easterbrook's lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-通过吸引人的飞机制服吸引公众注意力时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常为白色，但并非总是如此（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板应用了最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，合并和收购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
