New Delhi (CNN) India on Monday accused Chinese troops of taking "provocative" actions near a disputed border high in the Himalayas, violating previous deals between the two nuclear-armed rivals intended to ease tensions in the region.

The Indian allegations come two-and-a-half months after a bloody clash along the border left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead. China has never acknowledged any casualties from the hand-to-hand combat on June 15 in the Galwan Valley, north of where India says the latest tensions flared overnight Saturday into Sunday.

High-level meetings between Chinese and Indian military commanders since the Galwan Valley clash, in Eastern Ladakh, had helped to calm the situation along the de-facto border, known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC).

A statement by India's Defense Ministry said China's Peoples Liberation Army "carried out provocative military movements to change the status quo" and "violated the previous consensus arrived at during military and diplomatic engagements during the ongoing standoff in Eastern Ladakh."

The statement said that Indian troops preempted Chinese military activity on the southern bank of Pangong Tso Lake and undertook measures to strengthen their positions and "thwart Chinese intentions to unilaterally change facts on the ground."
