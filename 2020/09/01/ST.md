白宫高级顾问贾里德·库什纳（Jared Kushner）也在抵达美国时表示，华盛顿可以维持以色列的军事优势，同时增进与阿拉伯世界第二大经济体和地区大国阿联酋的联系。
在看似无关的事件中，当天早些时候在阿布扎比和迪拜的餐馆发生两起爆炸，造成三人死亡，当局称这是天然气故障的结果。
阿布扎比政府告诉居民“避免散布有关爆炸的谣言”，并“使用官方新闻来源”。
以色列外交部发言人在抵达阿布扎比后对阿拉伯电视台说，两国之间的直航也将列入议程。
警方和当地媒体说，飞机降落前几个小时，在阿布扎比和阿联酋旅游中心迪拜的两次爆炸中，三人丧生，数人受伤。

White House senior adviser Jared Kushner also said on arrival that Washington could maintain Israel’s military edge while advancing its ties to the UAE, the Arab world’s second largest economy and a regional power.
In apparently unrelated incidents, two blasts at restaurants in Abu Dhabi and Dubai killed three people earlier in the day in what authorities said were the result of gas malfunctions.
The Abu Dhabi government told residents “to avoid spreading rumours” about the blasts, and “use official news sources”.
Direct flights between the two countries will also be on the agenda, an Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman told al Arabiya television after landing in Abu Dhabi.
Hours before the plane landed, three people were killed and several others were injured in two separate explosions in Abu Dhabi and UAE tourism hub Dubai, police and local media said.

路透社的官方数据显示，周日，印度共有78,761例新病例，超过了7月16日美国先前的全球纪录77,299例。
自8月7日以来，这个世界第二人口大国的单日工作量一直是全球最高的。
印度的总病例数为362万，正在迅速赶上美国和巴西，但死亡率却较低。
印度卫生部表示，过去24小时内，印度的冠状病毒死亡人数增加了971，总数达到64,469。
阿萨姆邦（Assam）首席秘书库马尔·桑贾伊·克里希纳（Kumar Sanjay Krishna）是受灾最严重的州之一，他将案件的增加归因于更多的考验，经济的开放和自满。

On Sunday, India’s total of 78,761 new cases exceeded the previous global record of 77,299 in the United States on July 16, a Reuters tally of official data showed.
The world’s second-most populous country has been posting the highest single-day caseload in the world since Aug 7.
At 3.62 million cases, India is fast catching up to the United States and Brazil in terms of total cases but it has a lower death rate.
India’s coronavirus deaths went up by 971 in the past 24 hours, taking the tally to 64,469, the health ministry said.
Mr Kumar Sanjay Krishna, the chief secretary of Assam, one of the worst-hit states, attributed the increasing cases to more testing, the opening of the economy and complacency.

新加坡-Bellagraph Nova（BN）集团以可疑的营销手段越过越位之后，收购纽卡斯尔联合足球俱乐部（NUFC）的命运不佳，看来可能以失败告终。
报道称，英超俱乐部“仍在出售中，但迈克·阿什利（Mike Ashley）对两个想购买NUFC的团体失去了耐心”。
“据报道，当迈克·阿什利（Mike Ashley）已经接受并接受了3亿英镑的报价时，该集团的出价为2.8亿英镑。
“纽卡斯尔联队的球迷想要改变-他们迫切希望-但必须变得更好。

SINGAPORE - After straying offside with their questionable marketing material, Bellagraph Nova (BN) Group's ill-fated bid to take over Newcastle United Football Club (NUFC) looks likely to end in defeat.
It said the Premier League club "is still up for sale but Mike Ashley has lost patience with two groups who say they want to buy NUFC".
"The group's reported bid was £280 million, when Mike Ashley already had and accepted a £300 million offer.
"Newcastle United fans want change - they're desperate for it - but it has to be for the better.
"Mike Ashley is not even entertaining it - and that speaks volumes, given he is so desperate to sell the football club."

如果将社会距离提高到最高级别3，则对经济和社会影响保持警惕，卫生当局将重点放在阻止20岁至40岁年轻人的社交聚会上，这些年轻人占上周确诊病例的近40％。
星巴克和A Twosome Place等因闲逛而广受欢迎的咖啡馆连锁店已被勒令仅按外卖订单经营。
也已告知关闭此年龄段最受欢迎的室内运动设施，包括台球和室内高尔夫。
他补充说：“只有当我们的隔离系统被认为已经恢复了控制病毒状况的能力时，严格的措施才能放宽。”
他说：“当然，我担心收入，但我也希望冠状病毒的情况能很快消退。”

Wary of economic and social repercussions if social distancing is raised to the highest Level 3, health authorities focused efforts on discouraging social gatherings of young people aged between 20 and 40, who accounted for nearly 40 per cent of confirmed cases last week.
Cafe chains popular for hanging out, such as Starbucks and A Twosome Place, have been ordered to operate on takeout orders only.
Indoor sports facilities popular with this age group, including billiard and indoor golf, have also been told to close.
"Tightened measures can be eased only if our quarantine system is deemed to have recovered its ability to control the virus situation," he added.
"Of course, I worry about income, but I also hope the coronavirus situation will subside soon," he said.

吉隆坡-前总理马哈蒂尔·穆罕默德（Mahathir Mohamad）的新政党有望在周六的斯利姆（Slim）补选中失败，但令反对派感到极大关注的是先前热心的非马来支持将消失。
这是巫统自2月推翻马哈迪领导的Pakatan Harapan（PH）以来的第三次直选补选胜利，但这显然是第一次获得非土著选民的支持-这个名词通常指马来穆斯林多数部落和土著部落。

KUALA LUMPUR - Defeat for former premier Mahathir Mohamad's new party at Saturday's Slim by-election was expected, but of great concern to the opposition will be the evaporation of previously fervent non-Malay support.
This was Umno's third straight by-election win since the Mahathir-led Pakatan Harapan (PH) was toppled in February, but significantly the first where it gained the support of voters who are not bumiputeras - a term used to jointly refer to the Malay Muslim majority and indigenous tribes.

东京（路透社，彭博社）-当地媒体周一（8月31日）报道，日本执政的自民党（LDP）计划于9月14日举行领导人投票，以接替因身体不佳而卸任的首相安倍晋三。

TOKYO (REUTERS, BLOOMBERG) - Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) plans to hold a leadership vote on Sept 14 to replace Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is stepping down due to ill health, local media reported on Monday (Aug 31).
The new party leader will become the country’s next prime minister, due to the party’s parliamentary majority.
Suga declined to comment on Monday when asked about the LDP leadership race at his regular news conference as the government’s top spokesman.
His long-running battle with ulcerative colitis ended his tenure as Japan’s longest-serving prime minister.
Under the country’s parliamentary political system, lawmakers elect a prime minister.

芝加哥（路透社）-在俄罗斯和中国开发的备受瞩目的Covid-19疫苗存在一个潜在的缺陷：一些专家说，它们基于许多人都接触过的普通感冒病毒，有可能限制其有效性。
数十年来，研究人员一直在试验基于Ad5的疫苗来抵抗多种感染，但没有一种被广泛使用。
他的研究小组正在研发吸入型Ad5 Covid-19疫苗，从理论上讲，它可以规避先前存在的免疫问题。
但是他们警告说，在高危人群中对所有基于Ad5的疫苗进行试验期间和试验之后，应监测HIV的发生率。
“证明疫苗的安全性和有效性非常重要，”帮助设计强生公司Covid-19疫苗的哈佛大学疫苗研究员Dan Barouch博士说。

CHICAGO (REUTERS) - High-profile Covid-19 vaccines developed in Russia and China share a potential shortcoming: They are based on a common cold virus that many people have been exposed to, potentially limiting their effectiveness, some experts say.
Researchers have experimented with Ad5-based vaccines against a variety of infections for decades, but none are widely used.
His team is developing an inhaled Ad5 Covid-19 vaccine, theorising it could circumvent pre-existing immunity issues.
But they cautioned that HIV incidence should be monitored during and after trials of all Ad5-based vaccines in at-risk populations.
"Demonstrating safety and efficacy of a vaccine is very important," said Dr Dan Barouch, a Harvard vaccine researcher who helped design J&J's Covid-19 vaccine.

首尔（路透社）-美国驻韩国军事司令部周一（8月31日）表示，在周日晚些时候，四名韩国平民在一次撞车事故中丧生后，将在一定范围内暂停训练。

SEOUL (REUTERS) - The US military command in South Korea said on Monday (Aug 31) it would suspend training at a range after four South Korean civilians were killed in a crash with an armoured vehicle late on Sunday.
US Forces Korea (USFK) said the vehicle belonged to the 2nd Infantry Division-ROK/US Combined Division, which was the first division to include both South Korean and US troops, lead by an American commander with a South Korean deputy.
The two US soldiers in the armoured vehicle were "evaluated and returned to duty", USFK said.
About 28,500 US troops are stationed in South Korea, where the US has maintained a military presence since the 1950-53 Korean War.
The allies are in the midst of a dispute over how much South Korea should pay towards maintaining the troops, and South Korea has been pushing for the US to grant it the right to control all troops in the country in the event of a war.

雅加达（雅加达邮报/亚洲新闻网）-Covid-19不仅使许多幸存者的身体紧张，而且也使他们与朋友和邻居的关系紧张。

一些专家表示，印度尼西亚的Covid-19耻辱与艾滋病毒/艾滋病一样严重。
希斯卡女士说，误导和对Covid-19的不完全了解加剧了这种污名，因为人们常常对自己的症状不诚实，这种污名破坏了追踪和测试工作。
“ Covid-19是我们共同的敌人，这是真实的，应该有好的叙述。” Siska女士说。

JAKARTA (THE JAKARTA POST/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Covid-19 has not only strained the health of many survivors but also their relationships with friends and neighbours.
Ayu tested positive in mid-June, after she lost her uncle to Covid-19.
Some experts have said that the stigma of Covid-19 in Indonesia is as bad as that of HIV/Aids.
Amplified by misinformation and an incomplete understanding of Covid-19, Ms Siska said, the stigma had disrupted tracing and testing efforts because people were often dishonest about their symptoms.
There should be good narratives that Covid-19 is our common enemy and that it's real," Ms Siska said.
