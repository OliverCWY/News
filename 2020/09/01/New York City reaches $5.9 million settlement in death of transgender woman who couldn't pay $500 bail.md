(CNN) The City of New York has reached a settlement with the family of Layleen Cubilette-Polanco for $5.9 million following her June 2019 death while in custody on Rikers Island.

The transgender woman was arrested in April 2019 and sent to the jail complex because she could not afford $500 bail, her family previously told CNN. She was found unresponsive in her cell on June 7, 2019, and later pronounced dead.

Civil rights groups say Polanco's death represents a web of factors that can trap people of color in the justice system -- especially transgender women of color -- with devastating outcomes.

Her death also renewed conversation about the perils of cash bail and pretrial detention , raising questions about whether New York's recent bail reform laws could have saved her.

The settlement was first reported by The City. The family lawyer, David Shanies, confirmed it to CNN on Monday.
