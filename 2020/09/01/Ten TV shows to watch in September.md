The Third Day



Sky have embarked on an ambitious project starring Jude Law (The New Pope) and Naomie Harris (Moonlight), which incorporates a live epic theatrical event between regular episode broadcasts. A psychological thriller told over three interconnected stories, with episodes ‘Summer’ and ‘Winter’ bookending a live event, ‘Autumn’, to be broadcast on Sky Arts and online, produced in partnership with immersive theatre company Punchdrunk.

Set on a mysterious British island, we meet Sam (Law), who is drawn into the locals’ ritualistic way of life. As reality and fantasy begins to blur, Sam finds himself immersed in an emotional quest which puts him at odds with the islanders. On a mission to seek the truth, Helen (Harris) arrives to find her family caught between deeply entrenched forces on the island, which sparks a battle to decide its fate. Watch the trailer here. Premieres 14 September on HBO and 15 September on Sky Atlantic/Now TV.
