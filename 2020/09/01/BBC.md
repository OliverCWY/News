堡垒老板说，刻有符号的6世纪基督教圣杯碎片是英国有史以来最古老的碎片，堡垒老板说，在一个罗马要塞中发现了一个拥有1400年历史的基督教圣杯的碎片-最古老的人工制品在英国发现过的同类产品。
在赫克瑟姆附近的温多兰达罗马堡的一座六世纪教堂的废墟中发现了铅杯的碎片。
从周二开始，圣杯碎片将在哈德良长城附近的堡垒上展出。
他还说，罗马人当时很早就离开了堡垒，但圣杯表明，定居点在基督教崇拜中继续蓬勃发展。
“发现一个被基督教符号笼罩的圣杯，为英国北部的第五和第六世纪打开了新的篇章。

Fragments of the lead cup were found in the rubble of a 6th Century church at Vindolanda Roman Fort near Hexham.
The chalice pieces will be on display at the fort near Hadrian's Wall from Tuesday.
He also said the Romans had long since left the fort at that time, but the chalice showed the settlement continued to thrive in Christian worship.
"Finding a chalice smothered in Christian symbols opens up a new chapter for the 5th and 6th Centuries in northern Britain.

近几个月来，引入数字豁免护照的想法已开始流传，成为快速启动国际休闲旅行的潜在生命线。
“免疫护照是对Covid-19免疫的一种有力证明，”总部位于伦敦的专门从事面部生物识别认证的技术公司Onfido的联合创始人兼首席执行官Husayn Kassai说。
豁免护照是对Covid-19豁免的一种有力证明。4月，昂菲多（Onfido）受邀向英国议会科学技术委员会提交有关数字健康证书的提案。
在他们的提案中，翁菲多将豁免护照视为“新常态的关键”。
非接触式在线预订平台Sidehide于5月宣布，它将与Onfido合作，提供使用豁免护照的非接触式预订系统。

In recent months, the idea of introducing digital immunity passports has begun to circulate as a potential lifeline to jumpstart international leisure travel.
“An immunity passport is a presentable proof of immunity to Covid-19,” said Husayn Kassai, co-founder and CEO of Onfido, a London-based technology company specialising in facial biometric certification.
An immunity passport is a presentable proof of immunity to Covid-19In April, Onfido was invited to submit a proposal for digital health certificates to the UK Parliament’s Science and Technology Committee.
In their proposal, Onfido casts immunity passports as “the linchpin of a new normality”.
Sidehide, a contactless online reservations platform, announced in May it would partner with Onfido to deliver a contactless booking system using immunity passports.

早在2015年，近90万移民来到了希腊，但一些希腊人所表现出的同情和欢迎如今已烟消云散。
政府决心不让该国被视为通往欧洲的门户，并积极阻止新来者。
从土耳其通过陆路进入希腊，再经过巴尔干半岛再到西欧的人数仍然远低于五年前的特殊水平，但人数已经开始再次上升。
英国广播公司的Lyse Doucet听到了从希腊北部和南部的阿富汗和叙利亚旅行的人的消息。

Almost 900,000 migrants arrived in Greece back in 2015, but the sympathy and welcome shown by some Greeks has now largely evaporated.
The government is determined not to allow the country to be seen as a gateway to Europe and is actively deterring new arrivals.
The numbers of people coming from Turkey into Greece over land and then through the Balkans towards Western Europe remain well below the exceptional levels seen five years ago, but they have begun to rise again.
The BBC's Lyse Doucet heard from people who had travelled from Afghanistan and Syria, in northern and southern Greece.

亚航的创始人托尼·费尔南德斯（Tony Fernandes）正在建立他希望将成为该地区下一个“超级应用”的产品，因为他将应对冠状病毒旅行的低迷。
他希望通过一款用于食品配送，购物，付款，娱乐和旅行的多功能应用程序来与Grab，GoJek和WeChat等竞争对手竞争。
费尔南德斯在接受英国广播公司（BBC）采访时说，他在出差期间花了很多时间来改善亚航应用程序和该公司的支付平台BigPay。
亚航应用程序还向用户提供消息服务，它已将目光投向了超级应用程序，例如总部位于新加坡的Grab，印度尼西亚的GoJek和中国的美团。
“我知道超级应用程序听起来像是一个崇高的目标，但Grab和GoJek最初也只是食品或移动应用程序。

He wants to rival the likes of Grab, GoJek and WeChat with an all-in-one app for food delivery, shopping, payments, entertainment and travel.
In an interview with the BBC, Mr Fernandes said he has spent his time during the travel slump improving the AirAsia app and the company's payments platform BigPay.
The AirAsia app, which also offers users a messaging service, has set its sights on super apps like Singapore-based Grab, Indonesia’s GoJek and China’s Meituan.
"I know a super app sounds like a lofty target but Grab and GoJek also started out small as food or mobility apps.

## 冠状病毒：“外出就餐”折扣的最后一天

商家表示，该计划可为食客提供50％的折扣，最高可达10英镑。该计划成功地诱使更多的人在解除封锁后再次进餐。
这项折扣计划于今天结束，已在整个月的周一至周三适用于静坐餐和软饮，而使用次数没有限制。
OpenTable数据显示，上周二就餐的就餐人数比2019年同期多106％。
外出就餐帮助他弥补了部分损失。
不过他说，酒店业公司对秋天的忧虑重重，要求在今年晚些时候恢复“外出就餐”的补贴。

Businesses say the scheme - which gives diners 50% off, up to £10 - has successfully tempted more people to eat out again after lockdown was eased.
The discount scheme - which finishes today - has applied to sit-in meals and soft drinks, Monday to Wednesday throughout the month, with no limit to the number of times it could be used.
OpenTable data indicates there were 106% more seated diners last Tuesday than the same day in 2019.
Eat Out to Help Out has helped him recoup some of his losses.
However he said there was anxiety among hospitality firms about the autumn, calling for the Eat Out to Help Out subsidy to be revived later in the year.

中国科技公司的几位内部人士说，乔·拜登担任总统职位比特朗普总统再任四年更具吸引力-这将被视为“不可预测的”。
特朗普总统及其政府在有关中国的推文和新闻声明中谈到了这一点。
共和党海外游说团体副主席兼首席执行官所罗门·岳（Solomon Yue）表示，毫无疑问，在特朗普政府执政期间，“脱钩将加速进行”。
随着中美之间的紧张局势恶化，其他中国公司也将越来越多地效仿。
但这正是特朗普总统所说的需要改变的：他的政府认为中国已经变得更富裕，而美国却变得更穷。

Several insiders at Chinese technology firms say have told me that a Joe Biden presidency would be more appealing than another four more years of President Trump - which would be seen as "unpredictable".
President Trump and his administration talk about it in tweets and in press statements in relation to China.
Make no mistake, under a Trump administration "decoupling will be accelerated", according to Solomon Yue, vice chairman and chief executive of the Republicans Overseas lobby group.
Increasingly other Chinese companies are likely to follow suit, as tensions between the US and China get worse.
But that's precisely what President Trump says needs to change: his administration argues that China has become richer while the US has become poorer.
