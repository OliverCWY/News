Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who leaves office this week, has failed to make good on many of his promises.

He vowed to revive his country's economy; for a while, "Abenomics" was quite a global trend, with some touting it as a new management philosophy. Yet, last year, Japan's gross domestic product stood at 553 trillion yen (S$7 trillion), well below the 600 trillion yen economy that Mr Abe promised to achieve by last year under his "Japan Revitalisation Plan".
