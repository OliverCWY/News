新德里-印度各州报告说，由于最近几周冠状病毒病例空前增加，供不应求，印度的氧气不足以治疗Covid-19患者。
“在我们不确定氧气供应之前，我们无法重新接受ICU入学。”
此举影响了中央邦的一些医院，这些医院依赖于马哈拉施特拉邦的氧气供应。
同时，联邦政府于9月11日向所有州发布了一项指令，“以确保不限制医用氧气的流动”。
虽然各州已开始建立更多的医用制氧厂，但提高产量是一个漫长的过程。

NEW DELHI - States in India are reporting a shortage of medical oxygen, which is needed to treat Covid-19 patients, as demand outstrips supply amid an unprecedented increase in coronavirus cases in recent weeks.
"We are not in a position to take fresh ICU admissions until we are not assured of oxygen supply."
The move affected some hospitals in Madhya Pradesh that depend on oxygen supply from Maharashtra.
The federal government, meanwhile, issued a directive to all states on Sept 11 "to ensure no restriction is imposed on the movement of medical oxygen".
While states have begun setting up additional medical oxygen plants, ramping up production is a long drawn process.

即将离任的首相安倍晋三（Shinzo Abe）似乎证明了政治朝代在日本长期根深蒂固。
他已故的外祖父Nobusuke Kishi于1957年至1960年担任总理。
紧随其后的是叔叔佐藤荣作（Eisaku Sato），他在1964年至1972年间担任领军人物。

Look no further than outgoing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for proof that political dynasties have long been entrenched in Japan.
His late maternal grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, was prime minister from 1957 to 1960.
This was followed by great-uncle Eisaku Sato, who led from 1964 to 1972.

由于自民党在下议院的多数席位，自民党竞选的获胜者几乎肯定会在周三的议会投票中当选总理。
他将在2021年9月之前担任安倍晋三的党魁。
日本任职时间最长的首相安倍晋三上月表示，由于身体欠佳，他将辞职，任期将近八年。
外界猜测苏加将在下个月尽快召开议会下议院的大选，以增加他明年赢得连任三年的自民党首长的机会。
他赢得了大多数自民党派的支持，超过了他的对手，前防卫大臣石场繁和前外交大臣岸田文雄。

The winner of the LDP race is virtually certain to be elected prime minister in a parliamentary vote on Wednesday because of the LDP's majority in the lower house.
He will serve out Abe's term as party leader through September 2021.
Abe, Japan's longest serving premier, said last month he would quit due to ill health, ending a nearly eight-year term.
Speculation is simmering that Suga will call a snap election for parliament's lower house as soon as next month to boost his chances of winning a full three-year term as LDP chief next year.
He won support from most LDP factions, outpacing his rivals, former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba and ex-foreign minister Fumio Kishida.

日本首相安倍晋三（Shinzo Abe）本周卸任，未能兑现其许诺。
他发誓要振兴他的国家的经济。一段时间以来，“安倍经济学”已成为一种全球趋势，有人称其为一种新的管理理念。
然而，去年日本的国内生产总值（GDP）为553万亿日元（合7万亿新元），远低于安倍晋三在其“日本振兴计划”下承诺到去年实现的600万亿日元经济。

Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who leaves office this week, has failed to make good on many of his promises.
He vowed to revive his country's economy; for a while, "Abenomics" was quite a global trend, with some touting it as a new management philosophy.
Yet, last year, Japan's gross domestic product stood at 553 trillion yen (S$7 trillion), well below the 600 trillion yen economy that Mr Abe promised to achieve by last year under his "Japan Revitalisation Plan".

新加坡-世界末日的橙色天空充满了窒息的烟雾和灰烬，在异常炎热和大风的天气驱动下，社区逃离熊熊的大火，成千上万的房屋和生计沦为废墟。
贯穿美国西海岸的野火与去年年底和今年初烧焦澳大利亚东海岸的丛林大火非常相似。

SINGAPORE - Apocalyptic orange-coloured skies filled with choking smoke and ash, communities fleeing raging firestorms driven by freakishly hot and windy weather, thousands of homes and livelihoods reduced to ruins.
The wild fires tearing through the US West Coast are eerily similar to the bush fires that scorched Australia's east coast late last year and earlier this year.

（路透社）-一群两党美国国会议员敦促沃尔特·迪斯尼公司首席执行官鲍勃·查佩克（Bob Chapek）解释该公司与真人战争史诗《花木兰》制作过程中中国新疆地区“安全与宣传”当局的关系。
到晚上8点，该片票房达到4600万元人民币（920万新元），与其他大片相比开局缓慢。
花木兰（Mulan）因其明星刘亦菲（Liu Yifei）对香港警察的支持以及部分在新疆地区的拍摄而在海外社交媒体上引起强烈反响。
在中国流行的社交媒体网站豆瓣上，它的评分为4.7，满分10。
其他人指出了历史上的不准确性，包括使用电影拍摄背景仅几百年后出现的建筑物。

(REUTERS) - A group of bipartisan United States lawmakers has urged Walt Disney Co chief executive officer Bob Chapek to explain the company's connection with "security and propaganda" authorities of China's Xinjiang region during the production of live-action war epic Mulan.
It earned 46 million yuan (S$9.2 million) at the box office by 8pm - a slow start compared with other blockbusters.
Mulan has provoked a backlash on overseas social media over its star Liu Yifei's support of Hong Kong police and for being partly filmed in the Xinjiang region.
It was rated 4.7 out of 10 on China's popular social media site Douban.
Others pointed out historical inaccuracies, including the use of buildings that appeared only hundreds of years after the film's setting.

曼谷（法新社）-由于大流行使全球数以百万计的人呆在家里，泰国的“飞机咖啡厅”为顾客提供了假装他们在空中的机会-这个想法似乎已经普及。
26岁的Thipsuda Faksaithong说：“有了这间咖啡馆，我既可以坐在头等舱，也可以在装成飞机机长的驾驶舱里乱逛。”
她说：“坐在头等舱……在这里，确实给我一种实际上是坐飞机，在空中巡航的感觉。”
出行限制仍然使依赖旅游的经济内化，而泰国人由于其他国家的检疫要求而陷入困境。
政府目前正在与通行费较低的特定国家一起考虑旅行泡沫。

BANGKOK (AFP) - With millions around the world stuck at home due to the pandemic, "plane cafes" in Thailand are offering customers the chance to pretend they are in the sky - and the idea seems to have taken off.
"With this cafe, I can sit in first class and also mess around in the cockpit pretending to be the captain of the plane," 26-year-old Thipsuda Faksaithong said.
"Sitting right here in the first-class section... really gives me the feeling of actually being on a plane, cruising through the air," she said.
Travel restrictions have nevertheless eviscerated the tourism-reliant economy, while Thais have founded themselves stuck due to quarantine requirements in other countries.
The government is currently mulling over travel bubbles with select countries that also have low tolls.

德马尔勒特说，在手工艺品盆景中流行的食肉猪笼草和班蒂格树是其中的抢手货。
一个成熟的Monstera deliciosa或瑞士奶酪厂现在至少可以卖到3000比索（合85新元），而以前只有800比索。
想要在公寓中居住的东西的需求推动了其他面临封锁的城市的自用植物的销售。
甚至在大流行之前，千禧一代中就有一种在纽约和伦敦等城市养育“植物婴儿”的趋势。
首都的需求已经扩散到马尼拉广阔的城市周边郊区的小型运营商。

Carnivorous pitcher plants and bantigue trees, popular in crafting bonsai, are among those sought after, Mr Demallete said.
A mature Monstera deliciosa, or swiss cheese plant, now fetches at least 3,000 pesos (S$85), compared with as little as 800 pesos before.
The desire to have something living to care for in an apartment has boosted sales of house plants in other cities facing lockdowns.
Even before the pandemic there had been a growing trend among millennials to raise "plant babies" in cities such as New York and London.
Demand from the capital has spread to small operators in the suburbs around Manila's vast urban sprawl.

东京（法新社）-前日产汽车公司总裁卡洛斯·戈恩（Carlos Ghosn）漫长的传奇故事下周发生了新变化，汽车巨人转变为逃亡者的前助手格雷格·凯利（Greg Kelly）在东京接受审判。
多个消息人士告诉法新社，将与凯利一起接受审判的日产汽车表示同意，并计划认罪。
他坚持说：“卡洛斯·戈恩从未得到任何报酬，也没有向他承诺任何事情。”
尽管存在障碍，凯利的日本律师北村洋一先生表示，他“相信我们可以胜诉”。
戈恩为自己逃离日本的决定进行辩护，声称他不会受到公正审判。

TOKYO (AFP) - The lengthy saga of ex-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn takes a new turn next week when the auto titan-turned-fugitive's former assistant, Greg Kelly, goes on trial in Tokyo.
Nissan, which will be on trial alongside Kelly, says yes, and plans to plead guilty, multiple sources told AFP.
"Carlos Ghosn never got paid anything and he wasn't promised anything," he insisted.
Despite the obstacles, Kelly's Japanese lawyer, Mr Yoichi Kitamura, said he is "confident we can win the case".
Ghosn has defended his decision to flee Japan by claiming he would not have received a fair trial.

首尔（新华社路透社）-韩国周日（9月13日）放宽了人口稠密的首尔市区未来两周严格的社会隔离政策，每天新出现的新型冠状病毒病例顽固地徘徊在三位数以内。
总理郑锡均在电视会议上说：“在对最新情况和专家意见进行全面审查后，政府打算将首尔地区的社会隔离调整到第二阶段，为期两周。”
政府在8月下旬实施了空前的社会隔离措施后，感染人数稳定地下降到了100岁以下，但上周随着小集群的出现而激增。
截至周六午夜，韩国疾病预防控制中心报告了121例新的冠状病毒新型感染病例，使总感染数达到22,176，死亡358。
每天的案件量连续11天保持在200以下，但自8月14日以来继续以三位数的速度增长。

SEOUL (REUTERS, XINHUA) – South Korea on Sunday (Sept 13) eased its tough social distancing policy for the next two weeks in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, with new daily novel coronavirus cases hovering stubbornly within triple digits.
“After a comprehensive review of the recent situation and expert opinion, the government intends to adjust social distancing to phase two in the Seoul area for two weeks,” Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun told a televised meeting of government officials.
Infection numbers fell steadily to the low 100s after the government imposed unprecedented social distancing curbs in late August, but surged last week as small clusters emerged.
The Korea Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported 121 new cases of novel coronavirus infection as of midnight on Saturday, bringing total infections to 22,176, with 358 deaths.
The daily caseload stayed below 200 for 11 straight days, but continued to grow in triple digits since Aug 14.

新加坡-美国队长明星克里斯·埃文斯（Chris Evans）似乎在周日早上（9月13日）在互联网上溜走了，当时他在Instagram故事中发布了私人照片-包括一张清晰的照片。
这位39岁的演员分享了他的朋友玩琐事游戏Heads Up！的屏幕录像，但是当视频结束时，屏幕上显示了带有显式图像的胶卷。
“克里斯·埃文斯”也在Twitter上流行。
他们还在Twitter上充斥有益健康的内容，例如Evans和他的狗Dodger的照片，以淹没这些照片。
目前尚不清楚相机胶卷是否是克里斯·埃文斯（Chris Evans），他尚未公开解决泄漏问题。

SINGAPORE - Captain America star Chris Evans appeared to have slipped up on the Internet on Sunday morning (Sept 13), when he posted private photos onto his Instagram stories - including an explicit picture.
The 39-year-old actor shared a screen recording of his friends playing the trivia game Heads Up\!, but when the video ended, the camera roll with the explicit image was displayed on the screen.
"Chris Evans" is also trending on Twitter.
They are also flooding Twitter with wholesome content - such as pictures of Evans and his dog Dodger - to drown out the explicit pictures.
It is unclear if the camera roll is Chris Evans' or not, and he has yet to address the leak publicly.
