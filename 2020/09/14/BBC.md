## 失业：计划裁员率是上次衰退的两倍

### Unemployment: Planned redundancies twice the rate of last recession

计划从2009年1月至3月裁员18万，而计划从今年5月至7月裁员38万。
HR1的裁员数字不会减少少于20个工作岗位的雇主，因此最终裁员通常更高。
该数据总是在数据收集后的几个月才发布，因此尚未出现裁员或失业的大幅上升。
但是，劳动力调查的冗余数据近年来比HR1数据高出约20％。
但是，在衰退期间，实际的裁员比通知的裁员高80％，这可能导致在冠状病毒危机最严重时削减多达735,000个职位。

About 180,000 job cuts were planned from January to March 2009, while 380,000 were planned from May to July this year.
The HR1 redundancy figures don't pick up employers cutting fewer than 20 jobs, so the final total of redundancies is usually higher.
This is always published a few months after the data is gathered, so it hasn't yet picked up a big spike in redundancies or unemployment.
However, Labour Force Survey redundancy figures have been around 20% higher than HR1 figures in recent years.
During that recession, however, actual redundancies were 80% higher than notified redundancies - which could lead to as many as 735,000 positions being cut at the height of the coronavirus crisis.

"When the internet first emerged, we used to be worried about how children used the internet, said Mr McCann.

在政府为减轻冠状病毒而进行的巨额支出的推动下，美国的预算赤字已超过30亿美元（2.3亿英镑），创下历史新高。
甚至在大流行之前，美国今年的赤字就有望超过1千亿美元，按历史标准计算，这是很大的。
美国国会预算办公室本月预测，美国全年赤字可能达到33亿美元，是去年缺口的三倍多。
联邦政府的财政年度在9月结束。
该计划未能推进，民主党人表示，该计划与他们支持的逾3千亿美元的救济金相差甚远。

Even before the pandemic, the US was on track to run a deficit of more than $1tn this year - large by historic standards.
The Congressional Budget Office this month predicted that the US was likely to run a full-year deficit of $3.3tn, more than triple the shortfall recorded last year.
The federal government's financial year ends in September.
The plan failed to advance, with Democrats saying it fell far short of the more than $3tn in relief they support.
