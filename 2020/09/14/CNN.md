因为……根据我们的对待方式，在那之后我们可能还有资格再获得四个。”
而且，即使他在这个过程中进一步分裂了国家，他似乎也愿意使用一切必要的手段来使他们屈服。

There's never been anything like this," Trump said during the rally where he claimed he was "probably entitled" to a third term because he's been so poorly treated.
"The Democrats are trying to rig this election, because it's the only way they're gonna win," he said.
Undermining US institutionsAnd while political polarization in Washington pre-dated Trump, the intransigence has grown during his presidency.
Because ...based on the way we were treated, we're probably entitled to another four after that," he said.
And he seems willing to use whatever means necessary to bend them even if he further divides the nation in the process.

有迹象表明，特朗普政府正在采取措施来对抗俄罗斯的努力。
总检察长威廉·巴尔（William Barr）和国家安全顾问罗伯特·奥布赖恩（Robert O'Brien）也声称中国构成了最大的选举干预威胁，这模糊了来自中国的更广泛的国家安全问题与莫斯科出台的具体选举干预措施之间的界线。
一位前美国高级官员被告知入侵事件时说，伍德沃德的报告提到了2016年大选最令人震惊的事件之一。
财政部表示，代尔卡赫（Derkach）是“十多年来活跃的俄罗斯特工”，与俄罗斯情报部门关系密切。
在私营部门，随着选举日越来越近，社交媒体公司在2016年被俄罗斯为散布选举虚假信息的努力而措手不及。

There are signs the Trump administration is taking steps to counter Russian efforts.
Attorney General William Barr and national security adviser Robert O'Brien have also claimed China poses the biggest election interference threat, blurring the line between broader national security concerns from China and specific election interference efforts coming out of Moscow.
A former senior US official who was briefed on the intrusions said the Woodward report referred to one of the most alarming incidents from the 2016 election.
Treasury said Derkach was an "active Russian agent for over a decade" with close connections to Russian intelligence services.
In the private sector, social media companies who were caught flat-footed in 2016 by Russian efforts to spread election disinformation are seeking to be more proactive as Election Day gets closer.

重要事项：并非所有民意调查都是平等创建的，并且我们并未将所有民意调查都纳入平均值。
好的民意测验者几乎没有什么可隐藏的，而那些透明的民意测验者则平均而言更为准确。
投票者使用从现场采访民意调查到互联网民意调查到文本民意调查的一系列方法。
ENTEN：有零证明，特朗普选民对民意调查的回答率低于拜登选民。

(CNN) We've reached the portion of the 2020 presidential election where you're going to start seeing a lot of polls.
WHAT MATTERS: Not all polls are created equal and we don't include all polls in our average.
Good pollsters have little to hide, and those who are transparent are on average more accurate.
Pollsters use an array of methods from live interview polls to internet polls to text polls.
ENTEN: There is ZERO proof that Trump voters are answering the polls at a lower rate than Biden voters.

2020年9月6日，警察在香港巡逻，抗议政府因冠状病毒和国家安全法推迟举行选举的决定。
北京在今年早些时候对香港实施了一项新的国家安全法，该法禁止分裂国家，颠覆，恐怖主义和与外国势力勾结，引发了愤怒。
“在整个旅途中，香港，维吾尔人的困境，中国人对该病毒的宣传不断增加。

Beijing sparked outrage earlier this year when it imposed a new national security law on Hong Kong that bans secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.
"Throughout the trip, Hong Kong, the plight of the Uyghurs, Chinese propaganda over the virus kept coming up.
"The Commission does like to engage with issues and make strong statements, as they have done on Hong Kong lately.
But in my experience, it is rarely backed up with firm action," said Benedict Rogers, chairman of Hong Kong Watch, a London-based human rights group.

谁想要贸易协议？
但是，故意违反国际法会使其他国家的政府不太可能与英国接触。
上周五，英国与日本达成了一项贸易协议，并在很大程度上复制了该国与欧盟的协议，从而取得了胜利。
假设欧盟与英国的谈判破裂，包括日本协议在内的协议仅涵盖了英国贸易的10％。
仅剩几周的时间达成新的贸易协议，并避免新的关税和其他壁垒。

Who wants a trade deal?
But intentionally breaking international law makes other governments less likely to engage with the United Kingdom.
On Friday, the United Kingdom scored a victory when it clinched a trade agreement with Japan , largely replicating the agreement that country has with the European Union.
Assuming the EU-UK talks collapse, only 10% of UK trade is covered by agreements, including the Japan deal.
There are only weeks remaining in which to reach a new trade deal and avoid new tariffs and other barriers.

“哦，在这里看着我的非洲裔美国人。”特朗普笑着回应，指着奇德尔，人群中有些人在欢呼。
一些民意调查显示，特朗普在黑人选民方面的表现实际上要比四年前更好。
希德尔说：“他死了，这让他感到难过，但是共和党没有给他任何荣誉，就更让人难过。”
他说：“如果他（在黑人选民中）表现得和上次一样好，我会感到惊讶。”
与此同时，希德尔（Cheadle）终于与2016年特朗普的集会有足够的距离，可以开始撰写他的回忆录。

"Oh, look at my African American over here," Trump responded with a smile, pointing at Cheadle as some people in the crowd cheered.
Some polls suggest that Trump is actually performing better with Black voters than he did four years ago.
"It was sad that he died, but even more sad that he was not given any honor by the Republican Party," Cheadle says.
"I would be surprised if he did as well (with Black voters) as he did last time," he says.
In the meantime, Cheadle has finally got enough distance from that Trump rally in 2016 to start working on his memoir.

However, after a while Sharea looked over at her husband, snapped a photo and thought, "Man, he really looks like he is passed out in the driver's seat."
Sharea, a part-time photographer, decided to pass the time in the car by pulling a fun prank on her husband.
So, I decided to post the photo and asked people to photoshop some fun backgrounds into the photo.

记录说，六名工人中有四名后来也呈阳性-包括蒙哥马利和怀孕的巴顿。
亲商业团体已对“诉讼流行”发出警报。工人权益保护组织说，诉讼通常是要求问责制的最佳方法。
每个人都提供一个令人印象深刻的快照，说明在冠状病毒时代，工作场所变得多么紧张。
但是，针对工人的拥护者表示，由于难以证明某人在某个位置感染了病毒，因此这将给原告增加举证负担。
莫妮卡·蒙哥马利（Monica Montgomery）在4月24日测试为阳性；投诉称，她的女儿Nya Patton两天前检测出阳性。

Four of the six workers, the records say, later also tested positive -- including both Montgomery and Patton, who was pregnant.
Pro-business groups have sounded alarms about an "epidemic of lawsuits"; worker advocacy groups say the suits are often the best way to demand accountability.
Each one offers a telling snapshot of just how fraught the workplace has become in the age of the coronavirus.
But advocates for workers say this would raise an already high burden of proof for plaintiffs, due to the difficulty of proving that a person contracted a virus at a certain location.
Monica Montgomery tested positive on April 24; her daughter, Nya Patton, had tested positive two days earlier, according to the complaint.

（纽约国王）”王冠，这将作为苏富比嘻哈音乐拍卖的一部分进行拍卖。信用：经典的嘻哈文化对苏富比很重要的想法似乎有些讽刺。
我是那个年轻一代的一员，从第一次听到“说唱歌手的喜悦”开始，我就喜欢嘻哈音乐。
作为充满韵律之争的竞争领域，嘻哈时代已经一去不复返了。在这个嘻哈企业时代，这种激情已成为过去。
但是，苏富比的众多艺术品提醒我的是，并不是说嘻哈变得很棒，而是它一直如此。
苏富比首次拍卖嘻哈音乐，包括近代和传统物品，将于9月15日在纽约举行。

(King of New York)" crown, which is set to be auctioned off as part of Sotheby's hip hop sale Credit: Barron ClairebornYoung AmericansThe idea that classic hip hop culture could be significant to Sotheby's seems somewhat ironic.
I was a part of that young generation, and I loved hip hop from the first time I heard "Rapper's Delight."
Gone are the days of hip hop as a competitive field filled with rhyme battles; in this corporate era of hip hop, such passion is a thing of the past.
But what Sotheby's trove of artifacts does remind me is, it's not that hip hop has become great, it's that it always was.
Sotheby's first hip hop auction, of recent and legacy items, will be held in New York on September 15.

它被归类为“ D色”，是白色钻石的最高等级，并且在内部和外部都被认为是“无瑕疵”，从而跻身于世界上化学性质最纯净，透明和对称的钻石之中。
根据苏富比拍卖行的说法，这颗钻石将只是在拍卖会上出售的大小和质量可比的第八颗白钻。
据苏富比拍卖行称，此前仅有七枚D级无瑕（或内部无瑕）钻石重达100克拉以上。
竞标将从9月15日开始在线拍卖，最终拍卖将于10月5日在香港进行现场拍卖。
虽然白色钻石可以在拍卖会上吸引巨大的竞标，但近年来，粉色和蓝色品种的成交额甚至更高。

It has been classified as "D color," the highest grading for a white diamond, and is considered to be internally and externally "flawless," placing it among the world's most chemically pure, transparent and symmetrical diamonds.
The stone will be only the eighth white diamond of comparable size and quality to sell at auction, according to Sotheby's.
Credit: Sotheby'sOnly seven D color flawless (or internally flawless) diamonds weighing more than 100 carats have ever appeared at auction before, according to Sotheby's.
Bidding will open online from September 15, with the sale concluding at a live auction in Hong Kong on October 5.
While white diamonds can attract huge bids at auction, pink and blue varieties have achieved even larger sums in recent years.

在2018年《纽约时报》（New York Times）杂志派遣他到各个大洲记录气候变化之后，斯坦梅茨决定整理一本书，收集他整个职业生涯的图像。
“人类星球”记载了我们对环境的影响以及为保护环境而提出的解决方案。

Each location was unique, but the Steinmetz noticed a common theme -- humans were changing the planet.
After a 2018 New York Times Magazine assignment that sent him to every continent to document climate change, Steinmetz decided to put together a book, collecting images spanning his whole career.
"Human Planet" chronicles our impact on the environment and the solutions we have come up with to try to save it.
The accidental environmentalistThis bird's-eye view of the world allowed Steinmetz to witness -- and document -- the ways humans have changed the planet.
The photographer says he didn't intend to document climate change, but his archive of work made humanity's footprint undeniable.

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-当通过吸引人的飞机制服寻求公众的关注时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常是白色，但并不总是白色（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板可以应用最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，合并和收购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
