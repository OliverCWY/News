雅加达-雅加达州长安妮丝·巴斯维丹（Anies Baswedan）周三（9月9日）表示，随着Covid-19案件继续激增，印尼首都将采取严格的限制性措施。
阿尼斯先生补充说，雅加达市政府管理的所有娱乐中心将关闭。
雅加达（Jakarta）是一个拥有1000万人口的城市，它是该国Covid-19疫情的第一个震中，因此具有可疑之处。
它在周三报告了1004例新病例，使该市的总数达到49397例。
雅加达省长说：“面对紧急情况，雅加达除了尽快拉动紧急刹车外别无选择。”

JAKARTA - Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan on Wednesday (Sept 9) said that strict restrictive measures would be reimposed in the Indonesian capital as Covid-19 cases continued to surge.
Mr Anies added that all entertainment centres managed by the Jakarta city administration would be closed.
A city of 10 million, Jakarta has the dubious distinction of being the first epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak in the country.
It reported 1,004 fresh cases on Wednesday, bringing the total number of cases in the city to 49,397.
“Faced with the emergency situation, Jakarta doesn’t have any choice other than pulling the emergency brake as soon as possible,” the governor said.

悉尼/北京9月9日，中国指责澳大利亚对中国记者进行野蛮骚扰，原因是澳大利亚当局针对北京方面试图影响新南威尔士州国会议员肖格特·莫泽尔曼（Shaoquett Moselmane）的目的，针对了几名中国记者和学者。
中国媒体说，另外两名中国记者也成为袭击目标。
自1973年以来，澳大利亚媒体首次在其最大的贸易伙伴中国没有记者。
中国现在似乎表明，对两名澳大利亚记者的待遇是对在澳大利亚对中国记者待遇的报复。
中国媒体报道说，澳大利亚情报人员于6月26日突袭了中国新闻工作者的住所，就在同一周，情报人员对与Moselmane先生有关的调查进行了突袭。

SYDNEY/BEIJING - China accused Australia on Wednesday (Sept 9) of brutal harassment of Chinese journalists as it emerged that Australian authorities had targeted several Chinese journalists and academics over an alleged attempt by Beijing to influence a New South Wales MP, Mr Shaoquett Moselmane.
Chinese media said two other Chinese journalists were also targeted.
For the first time since 1973, Australian media has no journalists in China, its largest trading partner.
China now appears to be indicating that the treatment of the two Australian journalists was retaliation for the treatment of Chinese reporters in Australia.
Chinese media reported that Australian intelligence officers raided the homes of Chinese journalists on June 26, the same week that officers conducted raids related to an investigation linked to Mr Moselmane.

新加坡-所有来自印度的，不是新加坡人和永久居民的旅行者，在出发前往新加坡之前都必须参加Covid-19考试。
从下周四（9月17日）开始，他们将必须提供有效的阴性结果，该结果来自聚合酶链反应测试，必须在他们飞往这里之前72小时内进行。
卫生部（MOH）在周三（9月9日）宣布这一消息时，注意到有报道称印度感染再次流行。
它说，新加坡也有“大量”进口病例也有最近到印度的旅行历史。
周一，三宗进口案件中有两宗来自印度。

SINGAPORE - All travellers from India who are not Singaporeans and permanent residents will have to take a Covid-19 test before departing for Singapore.
From next Thursday (Sept 17), they will have to present a valid negative test result from a polymerase chain reaction test that has to be taken within 72 hours before their flight here.
Announcing this on Wednesday (Sept 9), the Ministry of Health (MOH) noted reports of a resurgence of infections in India.

哥打基纳巴卢州-马来西亚政治分歧双方的政党在星期三（9月9日）晚上仍在争吵中，争夺由沙巴州民意测验的候选人，而提名前几天就受到内部竞争的刺激。
同时，由丹斯里·穆希丁（Tan Sri Muhyiddin）领导的马来西亚Parti Pribumi Bersatu任命拿督斯里·哈吉吉·诺尔（Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor）为州政府的候选人。
与PN结盟的另一派别，即团结党Tanah Airku Rakyat Sabah（明星）也参与了激烈的谈判。
穆萨（Musa）将叛逃的集会人员带到他的营地，从而使拿督斯里·沙菲（Datuk Seri Shafie）的政府没有多数席位，引发了沙巴州的民意调查。
穆萨曾希望在不参加民意测验的情况下，与与他结盟的议员们领导州政府。

KOTA KINABALU - Parties from both sides of Malaysia's political divide remained at loggerheads on Wednesday (Sept 9) night over who to field for the Sabah state polls, spurred by internal rivalries just days ahead of nominations.
Meanwhile, Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia, which is led by Tan Sri Muhyiddin, has put up Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor as its candidate to lead the state government.
Another faction allied to PN, Parti Solidariti Tanah Airku Rakyat Sabah (Star), was also involved in the heated negotiations.
The Sabah state poll was triggered after Mr Musa drew defecting assemblymen to his camp, leaving Datuk Seri Shafie's administration without a majority.
Mr Musa had hoped to helm the state government with the assemblymen aligned to him without going to the polls.

他不在教职人员中，在校园中以及在对该病毒呈阳性之后，没有出现任何症状。
卫生部说，所有从印度回来的进口病人都是在8月24日至8月28日之间到达的。
周三宣布的剩余60名新的冠状病毒患者中，住在宿舍的民工占了总数的57,166名。

雅加达-印度尼西亚下一届总统大选距离现在已经四年了，但几位知名人士正在加紧努力，宣布可能的候选人姓名，包括在佐科·维多多总统内阁中任职的候选人。
观察家说，2024年大选对潜在竞争者具有吸引力，因为他们不会面对现任总统，而后者通常会比挑战者拥有更大的政治优势。

JAKARTA- Indonesia's next presidential election is four years away, but several prominent figures have been gearing up to put out their names as possible candidates, including those serving in the Cabinet of President Joko Widodo.
The 2024 election is attractive to potential contenders because they would not face an incumbent president who would typically have a big political advantage over challengers, observers say.

Rizal先生本人最初被指控在同一项目中向Rosmah索取和收受贿赂共计2.18亿令吉的四项罪名。
他曾在马来西亚大型媒体集团Media Prima担任过传播执行官，并为总理的妻子处理媒体关系。
他说他一直在罗斯玛工作直到2018年中，当时国阵政府被罢免。
他对法庭说：“我感到恐慌，决定逃往印度尼西亚雅加达。”
里扎尔先生说，罗斯玛被视为可能影响纳吉决定和行动的配偶。

Mr Rizal himself was initially charged with four counts of soliciting and receiving bribes involving RM218 million for Rosmah over the same project.
He had worked as a communications executive at giant Malaysian media group Media Prima and was to handle media relations for the prime minister's wife.
He said he worked for Rosmah until the middle of 2018, when the Barisan Nasional government was ousted from power.
"I panicked and decided to flee to Jakarta, Indonesia," he told the court, as quoted by Malaysiakini.
Mr Rizal said Rosmah was seen as the spouse who could influence the decision and action of Najib.

但是，其叙述中的细节符合包括目睹罗兴亚难民，若开邦居民，塔达玛多士兵和当地政客在内的数十名目击者和观察者的描述。
尽管罗兴亚人来自缅甸若开邦，但该国政府声称他们是外国闯入者。
缅甸官员建议罗兴亚人烧毁自己的村庄，以获得国际同情。
国际刑事法院通常起诉那些被指控犯有种族灭绝或危害人类罪等严重罪行的高级人物，而不是普通士兵。
但是他呼吁追究责任，以防止对仍留在缅甸的60万罗兴亚人进一步暴行。

But details in their narratives conform to descriptions provided by dozens of witnesses and observers, including Rohingya refugees, Rakhine residents, Tatmadaw soldiers and local politicians.
Although the Rohingya are from Rakhine state in Myanmar, the country's government claims that they are foreign interlopers.
Myanmar officials have suggested that the Rohingya burned down their own villages to garner international sympathy.
The International Criminal Court normally pursues prosecutions of high-level figures accused of grave offences such as genocide or crimes against humanity, not rank-and-file soldiers.
But he called for accountability to prevent further atrocities against the 600,000 Rohingya who remain in Myanmar.

《内部市场法案》明确指出，某些规定“尽管与国际或其他国内法不一致或不兼容，但仍具有效力”。
政府表示，国际法将“以非常具体和有限的方式”被打破。
“这将违反国际法并破坏信任。
拉丁词意为“必须遵守协议”，是国际法的一项基本原则。
但是可能被忽略的具体协议清单不仅包括《北爱尔兰议定书》的规定，还包括“《欧盟退出协定》的任何其他规定”和“任何其他欧盟法律或国际法”。

The Internal Market Bill spells out that certain provisions are “to have effect notwithstanding inconsistency or incompatibility with international or other domestic law”.
The government has said international law would be broken “in a very specific and limited way”.
“This would break international law and undermines trust.
The Latin phrase, meaning “agreements must be kept”, is a basic principle of international law.
But the list of specific agreements that might be ignored includes not only provisions of the Northern Ireland Protocol but also “any other provision of the EU Withdrawal Agreement” and “any other EU law or international law”.

华盛顿（AFP）-根据对3,000名18至34岁住院患者的研究，患有病态肥胖，糖尿病和高血压等潜在疾病的年轻成年人置于呼吸机上或死于Covid-19的风险最高。
这项分析于9月9日（星期三）发表在《 Jama Internal Medicine》杂志上，重点研究了美国4月至6月之间住院的患者。
正如在其他年龄组中看到的那样，男性比女性面临更大的危险-占年轻人住院病例的58％，以及死亡或使用呼吸机的年轻人的65％。
具有这三种潜在疾病的年轻人与没有疾病的中年（35-64）患者有相同的死亡或插管风险。
这项研究与其他许多研究一起进行，表明肥胖的人患Covid-19并发症的风险更高。

WASHINGTON (AFP) - Young adults with underlying conditions such as morbid obesity, diabetes and hypertension are at the highest risk of being placed on a ventilator or dying from Covid-19, according to a study of 3,000 hospitalised patients aged 18 to 34.
The analysis, published on Wednesday (Sept 9) in the journal Jama Internal Medicine, focused on patients hospitalised between April and June in the United States.
As has been seen in other age groups, males are at greater risk than females - representing 58 per cent of hospitalised cases among young people and 65 per cent of young people who died or were placed on ventilators.
Young people with all three of these underlying conditions had the same risk for death or intubation as middle-aged (35-64) patients without the conditions.
The study joins multiple others indicating that obese people are at a higher risk of complications from Covid-19.
