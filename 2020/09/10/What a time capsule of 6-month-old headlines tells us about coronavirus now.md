New York (CNN Business) I was walking through one of the empty newsrooms at CNN's New York City office the other day when I noticed a newspaper front page, like a dinosaur fossil frozen in time.

"WORLD TURNED UPSIDE DOWN," the NYPost front page said. Next to the Post there was another stack of newspapers, equally out of date, carrying the news that the coronavirus has been "DECLARED A PANDEMIC."

Those front pages were printed six months ago this week. It was around that time when most CNN staffers began to work from home. Newspapers stopped being delivered. Almost everything else changed, too. The front pages are a little bit like a clock that stopped ticking at the moment of the blast. A reminder of when, as the Post put it, the world turned upside down.

I was grateful for the reminder. I was equally grateful on Tuesday, when, on a visit to my three-year-old's school—my first time there since March—one of the teachers handed me a bag filled with all the clothes and belongings we left there six months ago, when school suddenly turned into a Zoom session. It was another artifact from the pre-coronavirus past.

I bet we're going to hear a lot about "six months ago" as we approach September 12 and 13—six months since the slow-motion shutdowns sped up and much of American life went on pause. It's helpful to remember what those anxiety-ridden days and weeks were like—to examine what's changed, what hasn't changed, and what should have changed since then.
