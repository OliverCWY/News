(CNN) Maserati unveiled its first supercar in 15 years Wednesday. With a body made largely from lightweight carbon fiber and aluminum, the new MC20 can hit a top speed of 202 miles an hour and go from 0 to 60 in under three seconds.

Prices for the car will start at about $210,000.

Unlike Maserati's last supercar, the MC12, which cost almost $800,000 and stopped being produced in 2005, the new MC20 was entirely developed by Maserati, including its unusual 630-horsepower turbocharged V6 engine.

The Maserati MC20's aerodynamics were tested in a wind tunnel at the Italian racing car manufacturer Dallara.

In the MC20's engine, a spark plug ignites gasoline in a small separate chamber attached to each of the six cylinders instead of just igniting the fuel inside the cylinder itself, as in most gasoline engines. This creates a flame that enters the cylinder through a series of small holes and heats the rest of the fuel and air in there. There is another spark plug inside the cylinder that then ignites fuel in the normal way. Depending on the car's power requirements at any given moment, the pre-ignition chamber can be used or not. The result is an engine that, according to Maserati, has extremely high power for its size, but that can run smoothly and quietly during day-to-day driving. A similar system is used in Formula 1 racing engines.

The company also plans to introduce a fully electric version of the MC20 in 2022. Ultimately, Maserati plans to offer gasoline and electric versions of all its models, Maserati CEO Davide Grasso said.
