特朗普在2月7日对伍德沃德说：“这是致命的东西。”
特朗普对伍德沃德说：“太令人惊讶了。”他补充说，冠状病毒可能比流感“致命”五倍。
特朗普在七月份的最后一次采访中对伍德沃德说：“该病毒与我无关。”
到3月19日，特朗普告诉伍德沃德，他故意低估了危险以避免引起恐慌，他还承认对年轻人的威胁。
在整本书中，特朗普都提供了他对总统职位的见解。

"This is deadly stuff," Trump told Woodward on February 7.
"Pretty amazing," Trump told Woodward, adding that the coronavirus was maybe five times "more deadly" than the flu.
"The virus has nothing to do with me," Trump told Woodward in their final interview in July.
By March 19, when Trump told Woodward he was purposely downplaying the dangers to avoid creating a panic, he also acknowledged the threat to young people.
Throughout the book, Trump provides insights into his view of the presidency.

## 鲍里斯·约翰逊（Boris Johnson）的政府威胁要违反国际法。它可能适得其反

伯明翰大学民主教授尼基·希斯曼（Nic Cheeseman）指出，约翰逊政府承认自己愿意违反国际法，因此直接违背了自己的既定目标，即在脱欧后成为世界强国的力量。
“当你自己的政府承认会破坏国际法时，你如何与全球领导人就遵守其他国家的法治进行对话？”
尽管他承认英国违反国际法的案件“并不是那么引人注目……但这仍然是自己不必要的目标”。
显然，约翰逊的所作所为还远远没有达到这个规模，但为人们创造更便利的环境以使人们触犯法律最终使独裁者胆怯。”
爱尔兰副总理里奥·瓦拉德卡（Leo Varadkar）周三对RTE电台说，英国“ kamikaze”威胁要违反法律，将“适得其反”。

Nic Cheeseman, professor of democracy at the University of Birmingham, points out that by admitting it is willing to breach international law, Johnson's government is directly contradicting its own stated aims to be a force for good in the world post-Brexit.
"How can you have conversations with global leaders about obeying the rule of law with other countries when your own government is admitting it will break international law?"
And while he acknowledges that the case in the UK's breach of international law "is not so dramatic ... it is still an unnecessary own goal."
Obviously what Johnson is doing is nowhere near this scale, but creating a more facilitative environment for people to break law ultimately does embolden dictators."
And Irish Deputy Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told RTE Radio on Wednesday that Britain's "kamikaze" threat to break the law would "backfire."

在标准普尔（Standard＆Poor's）拒绝将特斯拉纳入其500只美国主要股票指数之后，特斯拉股价下跌了21％。
最近几个月特斯拉股价上涨的部分原因是，预计特斯拉股价将被添加到这一享有盛誉的指数中。
两家公司周二表示，此次合作使通用汽车获得了这家初创公司11％的股份，获得了20亿美元的股权。
标普500指数暴跌标普道琼斯指数9月4日宣布，它将增加三家新公司，其中没有一家是特斯拉，这是全球最有价值的汽车制造商。
尽管此后市值蒸发了约1000亿美元，但特斯拉的市值仍超过丰田，迪士尼和可口可乐。

Shares of Tesla lost 21% of their value after Standard & Poor's declined to add it to its index of 500 major US stocks.
Part of the rise in Tesla shares in recent months was on anticipation that it would get added to the prestigious index.
The partnership gives General Motors an 11% stake in the startup, receiving $2 billion in equity, the companies said Tuesday.
S&P 500 snubS&P Dow Jones Indices announced on September 4 it's adding three new companies — none of which were Tesla, the most valuable automaker on the planet.
Despite losing about $100 billion in market cap since then, Tesla is still worth more than Toyota, Disney and Coca-Cola.

斯里兰卡科伦坡（CNN）周二，一名死刑犯被判有罪，他是一名斯里兰卡议员，此前法院裁定他不得被禁止加入该国由225名议员组成的议会。
虽然他被判处死刑，但斯里兰卡自1976年以来就没有执行过处决，尽管去年，上届政府宣布了恢复这种做法的计划。
在针对他的案件尚待审理期间，贾亚塞切拉被斯里兰卡人民阵线（SLPF）提名为议会候选人。
SLPF由Rajapaksa兄弟Gotabaya和Mahinda经营，他们分别担任斯里兰卡总统和总理职位。
人民解放阵线领导人阿努拉·库马拉（Anura Kumara）表示，判处死刑的人成为国会议员是“不公正的”。

Colombo, Sri Lanka (CNN) A convicted murderer on death row was sworn in as a Sri Lankan lawmaker Tuesday, after a court ruled that he could not be barred from the country's 225-member Parliament.
While he was sentenced to death, Sri Lanka has not carried out an execution since 1976, though last year the previous government announced plans to resume the practice.
While the case against him was pending, Jayasekera was nominated by the Sri Lanka People's Front (SLPF) as a parliamentary candidate.
SLPF is run by the Rajapaksa brothers, Gotabaya and Mahinda , who hold the positions of President and Prime Minister of Sri Lanka respectively.
People's Liberation Front leader Anura Kumara said it was "unjust" for someone given a death sentence to be a member of Parliament.

（CNN）世界玩家协会（WPA）呼吁伊朗司法机构负责人立即将执行死刑的伊朗冠军摔跤手Navid Afkari处决。
伊朗官方媒体Mizan称，阿富汗人因涉嫌在2018年8月设拉子抗议活动中谋杀伊朗政府水和污水处理部门的安全特工Hasan Turkman而被判处死刑。
但是，WPA是有组织的运动员在世界体育治理中的领导声音，它呼吁伊朗随着Afkari的死刑迫在眉睫而受到国际体育驱逐的威胁。
WPA的一份声明说：“ Navid是当年参加反对伊朗经济困难和政治镇压的自发游行示威的数千名伊朗公民之一。”
“但是，伊朗当局不公正地将他作为攻击目标，他们想从一个受欢迎的，备受瞩目的运动员中树立榜样，并恐吓其他可能敢于行使人权参加和平抗议活动的人。”

(CNN) The World Players Association (WPA) has called for the head of the Iranian judiciary to grant an immediate stay of execution to Iranian champion wrestler Navid Afkari, who faces the death penalty.
Afkari has been sentenced to death in relation to the murder of the Iranian government's water and sewage department's security agent Hasan Turkman during the August 2018 protests in Shiraz, according to Iran's state media Mizan.
But the WPA, the leading voice of organized players in the governance of world sport, has called for Iran to be threatened with expulsion from international sport with Afkari's death sentence looming.
"Navid was one of thousands of Iranian citizens who took part in spontaneous demonstrations that year against economic hardship and political repression in Iran," said a statement from the WPA.
"However, he has been unjustly targeted by the Iranian authorities who want to make an example out of a popular, high-profile athlete and intimidate others who might dare exercise their human right to participate in peaceful protest."

来自美国空军的飞机出现了四足的机械狗，突袭了莫哈韦沙漠中的一个机场，为战争的未来提供了可能的预览。
但是上周进行的演习不是美国电影的背景，这是美军有史以来规模最大的高科技实验之一。
空军9月3日发布的新闻稿称，这只狗飞到空军C-130机上可能有敌意的简易机场后，被送往飞机外侦察威胁，然后内部人员才能受到威胁。
电子犬只只是美军称之为“高级战斗管理系统”（ABMS）的一个环节。
它使用人工智能和快速数据分析来检测和应对太空中对美国军事资产的威胁，以及通过导弹或其他手段对美国本土的可能袭击。

Emerging from United States Air Force planes, four-legged robot dogs scampered onto an airfield in the Mojave Desert, offering a possible preview into the future of warfare.
But the exercise conducted last week, one of the US military's largest ever high-tech experiments, wasn't a movie set.
Flying into a possibly hostile airstrip aboard an Air Force C-130, the robot dogs were sent outside the aircraft to scout for threats before the humans inside would be exposed to them, according to an Air Force news release dated September 3.
The electronic canines are just one link in what the US military calls the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS).
It uses artificial intelligence and rapid data analytics to detect and counter threats to US military assets in space and possible attacks on the US homeland with missiles or other means.

（CNN）周二宣布，曾两次获得奥运冠军的Caster Semenya因限制女性运动员使用睾丸激素而失去上诉。
根据去年推出的世界田径指南，为了在从4亿英里到1英里的比赛中竞争，Semenya必须服用降低睾丸激素的药物，而这位29岁的年轻人选择不参加比赛。
瑞士联邦最高法院驳回了Semenya的上诉，维持了体育仲裁法院（CAS）去年针对诸如Semenya等具有性发育差异（DSD）的女运动员的裁决。
宣布这项裁决后，塞梅尼亚在推特上写道：“让我的人民感到寒冷，一个人可以改变规则，但同一个人不能统治我的生活。”

(CNN) Two-time Olympic champion Caster Semenya has lost an appeal against the restriction of testosterone in female athletes, it was announced Tuesday.
Under World Athletics guidelines introduced last year, Semenya would have to take testosterone-reducing drugs in order to compete in races from 400m to a mile, which the 29-year-old has chosen not to do.
Switzerland's Federal Supreme Court dismissed Semenya's appeal, upholding the ruling made by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) last year regarding female runners, like Semenya, with differences of sexual development (DSD).
"Chills my people, a man can change the rules but the very same man cannot rule my life," Semenya wrote on Twitter after the ruling was announced.

这些头版是本周六个月前印制的。
就像《邮报》所说的那样，提醒人们世界何时颠倒了。
我敢打赌，随着9月12日和13日的到来，我们将听到很多关于“六个月前”的信息，这距离慢动作关闭加速了六个月，而美国人的生活却停滞了六个月。
记住那些充满焦虑的日子和几周是什么样的，以检查发生了什么变化，什么没有变化以及此后应该发生什么变化是很有帮助的。

"WORLD TURNED UPSIDE DOWN," the NYPost front page said.
Those front pages were printed six months ago this week.
A reminder of when, as the Post put it, the world turned upside down.
I bet we're going to hear a lot about "six months ago" as we approach September 12 and 13—six months since the slow-motion shutdowns sped up and much of American life went on pause.
It's helpful to remember what those anxiety-ridden days and weeks were like—to examine what's changed, what hasn't changed, and what should have changed since then.

母狮队典型的一天可能是凌晨5点，开始跑步和早餐，然后进行简报和早上巡逻，通常需要四个小时。
甚至被提名为“母狮队”（Lioness）的妇女（社区的八个氏族中的每个氏族中的一个）也有疑虑。
艰苦的工作在正常情况下，母狮队游侠通常在OCWR的六个营地和机动部队周围旋转三个星期，然后休息一周。
我们需要女士们接受教育，以便她们能够加入我们的母狮队。”南金依说。
他说：“一旦无线电设备投入使用，社区护林员之间的交流将得到极大的促进。”

A typical day for Team Lioness might begin at 5 a.m. with a run and breakfast, followed by a briefing and morning patrol, which typically takes four hours.
Even the women nominated for Team Lioness, one by each of the community's eight clans, had their doubts.
Grueling workUnder normal conditions, Team Lioness rangers typically work three weeks on, when they rotate around the OCWR's six camps and mobile unit, and one week off.
We need the ladies to get the education so that they can join us in Team Lioness," says Nankinyi.
"Once the radio equipment is operationalized, communication amongst the community rangers will be boosted in a big way," he says.

（CNN）玛莎拉蒂周三推出了15年来的首款超级跑车。
与玛莎拉蒂的最后一辆超级跑车MC12售价近80万美元并于2005年停止生产不同，新的MC20完全由玛莎拉蒂开发，包括不寻常的630马力涡轮增压V6发动机。
玛莎拉蒂MC20的空气动力学性能在意大利赛车制造商Dallara的风洞中进行了测试。
根据玛莎拉蒂的说法，其结果是该发动机在其尺寸方面具有极高的功率，但在日常驾驶中可以平稳，安静地运转。
玛莎拉蒂首席执行官戴维德·格拉索说，最终，玛莎拉蒂计划提供所有车型的汽油和电动版本。

(CNN) Maserati unveiled its first supercar in 15 years Wednesday.
Unlike Maserati's last supercar, the MC12, which cost almost $800,000 and stopped being produced in 2005, the new MC20 was entirely developed by Maserati, including its unusual 630-horsepower turbocharged V6 engine.
The Maserati MC20's aerodynamics were tested in a wind tunnel at the Italian racing car manufacturer Dallara.
The result is an engine that, according to Maserati, has extremely high power for its size, but that can run smoothly and quietly during day-to-day driving.
Ultimately, Maserati plans to offer gasoline and electric versions of all its models, Maserati CEO Davide Grasso said.

策展人爱德华·布莱伯格（Edward Bleiberg）向布鲁克林博物馆的埃及美术馆的参观者提出的最常见问题是一个直截了当但很突出的问题：为什么雕像的鼻子被打断了？
图片来源：纽约大都会艺术博物馆布莱伯格的研究现在是令人发指的展览“打击力量：古埃及的偶像破坏”的基础。
他承认，在三维雕像上突出的鼻子很容易折断，但是当平坦的浮雕也打碎鼻子时，情节就会变厚。
纳芙蒂蒂（Nefertiti）的丈夫Akhenaten在阿玛纳（Amarna）时期为埃及艺术带来了罕见的文体转变（ca.
布莱伯格说：“古代神庙在某种程度上被视为采石场。”他指出，“当您漫步在中世纪的开罗附近时，您会看到一堵古埃及物件，被修建在墙上。”

Credit: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New YorkBleiberg's research is now the basis of the poignant exhibition " Striking Power: Iconoclasm in Ancient Egypt ."
A protruding nose on a three-dimensional statue is easily broken, he conceded, but the plot thickens when flat reliefs also sport smashed noses.
Nefertiti's husband Akhenaten brought a rare stylistic shift to Egyptian art in the Amarna period (ca.
"Ancient temples were somewhat seen as quarries," Bleiberg said, noting that "when you walk around medieval Cairo, you can see a much more ancient Egyptian object built into a wall."

（CNN）时代的终结临近了。
14年后，“与Kardashians同行”将结束其在E上的表现！
真人秀电视巨星在2007年轰动一时，毫无疑问，它已经吸引了数以百万计的观众，同时为粉丝提供了在卡戴珊兄弟姐妹（Kourtney，Kim，Khloé和Rob）的生活中排在前列的席位，他们的母亲“妈妈” Kris Jenner和他们的同父异母的妹妹肯德尔（Kendall）和凯莉（Kylie Jenner）。
通过实拍镜头，美国真人秀电视的第一个家庭分享了“好时光，坏时光，幸福，眼泪以及许多人际关系和孩子”。
换句话说：足够丰富的戏剧性和感性的时刻可以让许多观众终生难忘。

(CNN) The end of an era draws close.
After 14 years, "Keeping Up with the Kardashians" will wrap up its run on E\!
The reality TV juggernaut, which burst upon an unsuspecting world in 2007, has entertained millions while giving fans front row seats to the lives of the Kardashian siblings -- Kourtney, Kim, Khloé and Rob -- their mother, the "momager" Kris Jenner, and their half-sisters, Kendall and Kylie Jenner.
Through the fly-on-the-wall footage, the first family of American reality TV shared "the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children."
In other words: enough dramatic and emotional moments to last many viewers a lifetime.

## 画飞机：为什么每一层都很重要

### Painting an airplane: Why every layer counts

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-通过吸引人的飞机制服吸引公众注意力时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常为白色，但并非总是如此（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板应用了最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，合并和收购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
