客人通过口口相传：当地的爵士乐迷们会参加一次，然后与一群朋友一起返回。
周围的人们亲眼目睹了她通过音乐将陌生人聚在一起的强大方式。
艺术是她的宣泄和创造力的发源地，而爵士沙龙成为艾略特表扬她的孩子们的一种方式。
有时，艾略特（Eliot）承认在周日弹钢琴时会被情绪所打动，但观众们却发现了源源不断的毅力。
每个人离开后，艾略特（Eliot）将椅子放在钢琴前面，使客厅看起来像一个渴望的礼堂。

Guests multiplied through word of mouth: local jazz aficionados would attend once and return later with throngs of friends.
People in the neighbourhood came by to witness the powerful way she brought strangers together in shared communion over music.
Art was her catharsis and her creative outlet, and Parlor Jazz became a way for Eliot to honour her children.
Sometimes, Eliot admits that she’s overcome with emotion while playing the piano on Sundays, but the audience has proven an endless source of fortitude.
After everyone’s left, Eliot keeps the chairs in front of the piano, giving the living room the permanent look of an eager auditorium.

Authorities placed the Moria camp under quarantine last week after a Somali migrant tested positive for the coronavirus.
At the time, there were 8,000 people living in the Moria camp.

美国将在9月底之前从伊拉克撤军2,200人发布时间6小时前图片版权Reuters路透社图片说明自2014年以来，美军已向伊拉克部署，以帮助打击伊斯兰国集团。美国将在几周内从伊拉克撤军三分之一以上，其最高中东司令官曾表示。
上个月，美国总统唐纳德·特朗普重申，他计划尽快将所有部队撤出伊拉克。
2003年，以美国为首的部队入侵伊拉克，推翻了萨达姆·侯赛因总统，并消除了原来不存在的大规模杀伤性武器。
当时的看守总理阿德尔·阿卜杜勒·马赫迪（Adel Abdul Mahdi）谴责了这次袭击，“明显违反了美军的存在条款”。
同时，伊朗作为回应，在容纳美军的两个伊拉克军事基地发射了弹道导弹。

Last month, US President Donald Trump reaffirmed that he planned to pull all troops out of Iraq as soon as possible.
In 2003, US-led forces invaded Iraq to overthrow President Saddam Hussein and eliminate weapons of mass destruction that turned out not to exist.
The attack was condemned by then caretaker Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi as a "clear breach of the terms of the American forces' presence".
Iran meanwhile responded by launching ballistic missiles at two Iraqi military bases hosting US forces.

西蒙房地产集团和布鲁克菲尔德房地产合作伙伴表示，他们将保持彭尼JC商店的大部分营业，从而可能节省7万个工作岗位。
JC Penney于5月宣布破产时，拥有大约850个地点，并雇用了80,000多名员工。
零售业的困境早在1902年在怀俄明州成立的JC Penney的困境也早于大流行。
此前曾警告称救援谈判进展不佳的彭尼表示，它计划在十月份寻求法院对最终协议的批准。
“西蒙，布鲁克菲尔德，贷方以及公司，债权人委员会都致力于迅速推动这一进程，并据我们所知挽救了杰西·彭尼。”

Simon Property Group and Brookfield Property Partners said they would keep the majority of JC Penney's stores open, potentially saving 70,000 jobs.
JC Penney had about 850 sites and employed more than 80,000 people when it declared bankruptcy in May.
Retail strugglesThe woes of JC Penney, founded in 1902 in Wyoming, also predate the pandemic.
JC Penney, which had warned previously that rescue talks were not going well, said it planned to seek court approval of a final deal in October.
"Simon, Brookfield, the lenders and the company, the creditors committee are all committed to moving this forward quickly and saving JC Penney as we know it."

Amazon and other tech firms have faced scrutiny over how much tax they pay in the UK, prompting the government to launch a digital sales tax in April.
In April, the UK launched a 2% tax on digital sales amid concerns that big tech firms we re-routing their profits through low tax jurisdictions.
Amazon is led by world's richest man Jeff Bezos, whose personal fortune rose as high as $200bn (£155bn) in recent weeks as tech firms' stock market valuations soared.

Rio Tinto, one of the biggest companies listed on London's FTSE 100, says it had permission to blow up two caves at Juukan Gorge.

他说，英国隔离区“块状且有缺陷”，英国需要在机场进行检测，以确保国际旅行的安全返回。
O'Leary先生将英国政府的记录描述为“在与Covid交往的几乎所有方面都相当贫穷”。
他说：“这就是为什么我们的隔离系统必须成为我们与Covid打交道的手段，工具箱的重要组成部分。”

He said the UK quarantine was "lumpy and defective" and that the UK needed to use testing at airports to help the safe return of international travel.
Mr O'Leary described the record of the UK government as "pretty poor in almost all respects of dealing with Covid".
"That's why the quarantine system that we have has got to be an important part of our repertoire, of our toolbox, in fighting Covid," he said.
