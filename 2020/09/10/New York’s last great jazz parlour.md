She and her late husband, the percussionist Al Drears, had often hosted readings and rehearsals in their apartment, so having the shows there felt natural. She scheduled them Sundays after church to keep the sorrow from creeping into her home on weekends. “I was so distraught on Sundays because that was the day Philip left,” she said. Guests multiplied through word of mouth: local jazz aficionados would attend once and return later with throngs of friends. People in the neighbourhood came by to witness the powerful way she brought strangers together in shared communion over music.

“Even if someone doesn’t speak the language, they get the emotional weight of it,” Eliot said. “[This event] has kept me from wallowing in sadness.”

The music continued when Eliot’s eldest child, Michael, died from sudden meningitis in 2006, and when her third-born son, Alfie, passed away from heart complications in 2015. Art was her catharsis and her creative outlet, and Parlor Jazz became a way for Eliot to honour her children. She celebrates their memories both through plays she’s written that are inspired by them – which different actors perform selections of in between songs – and music from their childhoods. “Ours was a jazz house. [My sons] could play all kinds of things, but they grew up hearing this music,” she said.

Sometimes, Eliot admits that she’s overcome with emotion while playing the piano on Sundays, but the audience has proven an endless source of fortitude. “They hold me up. They’re like, ‘Do it’,” she said. When her guests burst into applause, she returns the gesture, clapping her hands back at them in an endless loop of gratitude. “I’ll get asked, ‘It’s not gonna slow down, right? You’re not going to stop?’. But what would I do without it?”

Her weekly concerts have created communities of regulars, starting with the band. Though the roster changes, it usually includes saxophonist Sedric Choukroun and trumpet players Nicholas Mauro and Koichi Yoshihara. Eliot often asks friends to pop in: Will Glass, from the Jazz Foundation of America, played drums at a recent performance; and bassist Ben Meigners now fills in for the late bass legend Bob Cunningham. Eliot’s fourth-born son, Rudel Drears, switches between piano and lead vocals, leading the crowd in everything from doo-wop anthems to spirituals. Helga Athineos, a neighbour with white hair and round-rimmed glasses, serves free cups of orange juice and granola bars to the audience. Athineos is also in charge of passing around a donation bucket, though Eliot is adamant that it’s a suggestion – the music is free.

In such a close setting, the musicians don’t need to use microphones. When the sun goes down in the evening, they play under the soft glow of yellow, blue and red lightbulbs that twinkle along the walls. After everyone’s left, Eliot keeps the chairs in front of the piano, giving the living room the permanent look of an eager auditorium. She moved the couch and other living room furniture out 25 years ago and never put it back. “My little Carnegie Hall,” she frequently jokes.
