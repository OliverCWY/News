"People want to remind you about the rules with the implication that they don't believe you're going to do it," says Trager about his experiences with social media shaming.
"When the stakes feel high, people feel justified in shaming and they feel justified in being harsh with their shaming," says Thomason.

亚马尔陨石坑是该地区发现的第一个大洞。

Bogoyavlensky不相信这些火山口的主要原因是与气候变化有关的温度升高。

这些漏洞很少，因此可以肯定地说，这很棘手，但是我非常相信气候变化在其中发挥了作用。”

The Yamal Crater was the first of these massive holes to be discovered in the region.
The explosions all ejected ground ice, which in some cases leaves holes where huge frozen blocks have fallen on the surface.
Bogoyavlensky isn't convinced that the primary cause of these craters is warming temperatures linked to climate change.
Likewise, Natali said she believed climate change plays a role -- although more data is needed to say definitively.
There's so few of these holes so it might be tricky to say for certain, but I'm pretty confident climate change is playing a role in this."

塞巴斯蒂安·维特尔（Sebastian Vettel）未能进入第一轮资格赛，只能排名第17位，而队友查尔斯·勒克莱尔（Charles Leclerc）进入第二轮资格赛，但在周日的比赛之前只能排在第13位。
法拉利（Ferrari）知道要为进入本周末的意大利大奖赛而努力奋斗，但即使他们也无法预测事情会变得如此糟糕。
勒克莱尔以45分排在车手积分榜的第五位，已经落后失控的领先者路易斯·汉密尔顿112分。
对于四届世界冠军维特尔（Vettel）而言，情况甚至更糟，后者仅获得16分并排在第13位。
在车队排名中，法拉利名列第五，落后领先者梅赛德斯（Mercedes）203分。

Sebastian Vettel didn't make it out of the first qualifying round and could only muster a lowly 17th place, while teammate Charles Leclerc made it into the second qualifying round but could only claim 13th on the grid ahead of Sunday's race.
Ferrari knew it would struggle for speed coming into this weekend's Italian Grand Prix, but even they couldn't have predicted things would be this bad.
Leclerc sits in fifth place in the drivers' championship with 45 points, already 112 points behind runaway leader Lewis Hamilton.
Things are even worse for four-time world champion Vettel, who only has 16 points and sits in 13th place.
In the constructors' standings, Ferrari is in 5th place and a whopping 203 points behind leader Mercedes.

关于道德时尚和可持续性的广泛误解有时会阻止消费者在生活方式上采取有意义的行动。
误区：从“环保意识”或“可持续”品牌购买商品是减少时尚足迹的最佳方法真相：减少时尚足迹的最佳方法是少买东西。
研究可持续品牌是有帮助的，但是购买新产品应该是最后的选择，而不是第一个选择。
误解：奢侈时尚比快时尚更具可持续性真相：花钱购买奢侈时尚并不能保证可持续性。
麦肯锡（McKinsey）的萨斯基亚·赫德里奇（Saskia Hedrich）告诉美国有线电视新闻网，“评估可持续时尚的客观标准缺失。

Widespread misconceptions about ethical fashion and sustainability can sometimes keep consumers from taking meaningful action when it comes to their lifestyles.
MYTH: Buying from "eco-conscious" or "sustainable" brands is the best way to reduce your fashion footprintTRUTH: The best way to reduce your fashion footprint is to buy fewer things.
Researching sustainable brands is helpful, but buying something new should be the last option, not the first.
MYTH: Luxury fashion is more sustainable than fast fashionTRUTH: Spending money on luxury fashion does not guarantee sustainability.
"Objective criteria for rating sustainable fashion are missing," McKinsey's Saskia Hedrich told CNN.

Big Lots BIG是一家在美国拥有1400多家商店的零售商，近年来销售额停滞不前，但在最近一个季度中，销售额创下了创纪录的增长，赢得了竞争对手的市场份额。
家具是Big Lots最大的业务。
分析师说，这些种类繁多的商品有助于Big Lots与传统的家居装饰和家具销售商以及杂货商区分开。
Big Lots还提供清仓商品，当制造商生产过多的物品或停产生产线时，会从制造商那里获取。
Big Lots商店的平均面积为25,000平方英尺，比典型的超市要小一些。

Big Lots BIG , a retailer with more than 1,400 US stores, saw sales stagnate in recent years but experienced record sales growth during its most recent quarter, gaining market share from rivals.
Furniture is Big Lots' biggest business.
This broad range of items helps Big Lots distinguish itself from traditional home decor and furniture sellers, as well as grocers, analysts say.
Big Lots also offers closeout merchandise, which it scoops up from manufacturers when they produce too much of an item or discontinue a line.
At an average of 25,000 square feet, Big Lots stores are a little smaller than a typical supermarket.

Video games helped him to overcome life's hardships.
"It's important to know when it's time to come up for air though," he says, adding that video gaming can be problematic when "it becomes an obsession and blocks out other important areas of a person's life."
The global esports market exceeded $1 billion in revenue last year, with tournaments attracting more than 400 million viewers, according to research by online video game retailer Green Man GamingPrize money has rocketed.
Hart believes that video gaming offers an escape -- especially to people like himself who may not fit within the social norm.

不可能-毕竟，月球上没有氧气，这是造成生锈的两个基本要素之一，另一个是水。
印度的月球探测器Chandrayaan-1在2008年绕月飞行，收集了多年来导致许多发现的数据-包括其表面有水分子的信息。
探测器还携带了由美国国家航空航天局（NASA）建造的仪器，可以分析月球的矿物成分。
月球上有很多富含铁的岩石-但是只有当铁暴露于氧气和水中时才会产生生锈。

(CNN) The moon is getting rusty.
It shouldn't be possible -- after all, there's no oxygen on the moon, one of the two essential elements to create rust, the other being water.
India's lunar probe, Chandrayaan-1, orbited the moon in 2008, gathering data that has led to numerous discoveries over the years -- including the revelation that there are water molecules on its surface.
The probe also carried an instrument built by NASA that could analyze the moon's mineral composition.
There are plenty of iron-rich rocks on the moon -- but rust is only produced when iron is exposed to oxygen and water.

## 画飞机：为什么每一层都很重要

### Painting an airplane: Why every layer counts

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-通过吸引人的飞机制服吸引公众注意力时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常为白色，但并非总是如此（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板应用了最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，合并和收购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
