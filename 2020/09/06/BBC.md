退伍军人组织是谴责特朗普的人之一，距离2020年大选不到两个月。
特朗普先生继续袭击了另一位记者，福克斯新闻的珍妮弗·格里芬，通常是总统最喜欢的新闻媒体之一。
特朗普在推特上说：“应该因为这种报道而开除詹妮弗·格里芬。”
在伊拉克丧生的一名美军士兵的父亲克孜尔·汗（Khizr Khan）在电话会议上加入了达克沃斯女士。
特朗普先生表示愤慨，说已故的越南战俘参议员约翰·麦凯恩不是“战争英雄”，他说：“我喜欢未被俘虏的人。”

Veterans' groups are among those condemning Mr Trump, less than two months from the 2020 election.
Mr Trump went on to attack another journalist, Jennifer Griffin of Fox News, normally one of the president's favourite news outlets.
"Jennifer Griffin should be fired for this kind of reporting," Mr Trump tweeted.
Khizr Khan, the father of a US soldier killed in Iraq who criticised Mr Trump during the 2016 Democratic convention, joined Ms Duckworth on the call.
Mr Trump caused outrage by saying the late Senator John McCain, a prisoner of war in Vietnam, was not a "war hero" saying: "I like people who weren't captured."

但是，当我终于鼓起勇气问一个法国朋友时，他吓了一跳：他们不是抱怨者，他说。
在法国，“抱怨”有几个词：“ se plaindre”，用于常规的旧抱怨；有“搬运工抱怨”，因为抱怨更加正式。
您可能对以下内容也感兴趣：•为什么法国人喜欢拒绝••为什么这座城市如此宽容？
法国人对抱怨的态度令许多英语国家的人感到不舒服，其中许多人认为消极情绪会滋生消极情绪。
但是法国流氓很可能避免这种不幸的副作用，部分原因是他们很少抱怨自己的生活，而是抱怨外部问题。

But when I finally got up the courage to ask a French friend, he baulked: they weren’t complainers, he said.
In France, there are several words for “to complain”: there’s “se plaindre”, used for regular old complaining; there’s “porter plainte”, for complaining more officially.
You may also be interested in:• Why the French love to say no• Why is this city so tolerant?
The French attitude towards complaining is uncomfortable for many Anglophones, many of whom argue that negativity breeds negativity.
But French râleurs may well avoid this unfortunate side effect, in part because they rarely complain about their own lives but rather about external issues.
