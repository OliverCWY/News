(CNN) Ferrari's miserable season has gone from bad to worse as the Italian manufacturer failed to get either car into the top 10 at its home grand prix for the first time since 1984.

Sebastian Vettel didn't make it out of the first qualifying round and could only muster a lowly 17th place, while teammate Charles Leclerc made it into the second qualifying round but could only claim 13th on the grid ahead of Sunday's race.

Ferrari knew it would struggle for speed coming into this weekend's Italian Grand Prix, but even they couldn't have predicted things would be this bad.

Leclerc sits in fifth place in the drivers' championship with 45 points, already 112 points behind runaway leader Lewis Hamilton. Things are even worse for four-time world champion Vettel, who only has 16 points and sits in 13th place.

In the constructors' standings, Ferrari is in 5th place and a whopping 203 points behind leader Mercedes.
