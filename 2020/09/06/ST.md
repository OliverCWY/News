新德里（AFP）-印度已成为第三个传播400万例冠状病毒感染的国家，由于大流行没有迹象显示高峰，因此星期六（9月5日）的病例每天创下新高。
新的病例使印度感染了4,023,179，仅次于美国，后者超过630万，仅次于巴西，达到410万。
总理朱塞佩·孔戴（Giuseppe Conte）对这一事件反应冷淡，说：“有274,000多人患病，35,000人死亡。
英国首相鲍里斯·约翰逊（Boris Johnson）的政府试图鼓励人们重返办公室，但这说起来容易做起来难。
同时，他的医生说，意大利华丽的前任总理西尔维奥·贝卢斯科尼（Silvio Berlusconi）在住院两天后的周六“稳定”。

NEW DELHI (AFP) – India has become the third country to pass four million coronavirus infections, setting a new record daily surge in cases on Saturday (Sept 5) as the pandemic showed no sign of peaking.
The new cases took India to 4,023,179 infections, third behind the United States which has more than 6.3 million and just trailing Brazil on 4.1 million.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte reacted frostily to the event, saying: “More than 274,000 ill and 35,000 dead.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government is trying to encourage people to return to the office, but that is easier said than done.
Meanwhile, Italy’s flamboyant former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi was “stable” Saturday, two days after being hospitalised, his doctor said.

香港-最初是在餐巾纸上涂抹文字，现在已成为如何在大流行中经营餐厅的便捷指南，现在世界各地各行各业都在提及这种情况。
长达20页的Covid-19剧本是常识和实用性的完美结合，它是由香港酒店集团“黑羊饭店”（Black Sheep Restaurants）的管理团队于年初年初编写的。
我们只是愚蠢的餐馆人，”侯赛因先生说，将这种经历描述为“相当狂野”和“真正的谦卑”。
尽管冠状病毒大流行给全球经济带来了损失，但鉴于香港去年的动荡，这对香港来说是双重打击。
“我们是使香港光彩照人的因素，如果我们失去了这一点，那当然是我们的损失，这是行业的损失，但这也是城市的损失。”

HONG KONG - What started out as scribbles on napkins have turned into a handy guide on how to run a restaurant in a pandemic that is now referred to by varied sectors around the world.
The 20-page Covid-19 Playbook, a mish-mesh of common sense and practicality, was compiled by the management team at Hong Kong hospitality group Black Sheep Restaurants at the start of the year.
We're just silly restaurant people," Mr Hussain said, describing the experience as "pretty wild" and "really humbling".
While the coronavirus pandemic has taken its toll on global economies, for Hong Kong it is a double whammy given last year's unrest.
"We are what makes Hong Kong glossy and if we lose that, of course it's our loss, it's the industry's loss, but it's also the city's loss."
