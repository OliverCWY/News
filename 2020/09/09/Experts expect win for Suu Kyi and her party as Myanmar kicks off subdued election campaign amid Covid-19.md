BANGKOK - A masked and gloved Myanmar State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi kicked off the ruling National League for Democracy's (NLD) election campaign on Tuesday (Sept 8) by raising its flag in Naypyitaw. In the commercial capital of Yangon, streets that would have been filled with canvassers were relatively quiet, with restaurants forced to shutter dine-in operations.

Like South Korea and Singapore before it, Myanmar is now heading towards national polls, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. The election is set for Nov 8.
