最近几周，加州大火烧毁了创纪录的200万英亩。
总体而言，这些大火的面积比美国特拉华州大。
星期二早些时候，加利福尼亚国民警卫队开始努力接触被塞拉利昂国家森林小溪大火困住的徒步旅行者和露营者。
加州国民警卫队的戴维·霍尔上校周二早些时候表示，“仍有许多人仍在试图营救。”

中国说，目前尚不清楚程磊据称犯下了什么“犯罪活动”。一名在中国被拘留了数周的澳大利亚记者因国家安全原因而被拘留。
中国全球电视网（CGTN）的主持人成磊被怀疑“危害中国国家安全的犯罪活动”。
但是现在外交部发言人赵立建说，政府以“国家安全为由”将她拘留，称当局对她采取了“强制性措施”。
他说，警方没有拘留他，但告诉他，他参与了“国家安全调查”，他无法离开该国。
Birtles先生说，他还被问及他曾经用来报道香港的国家安全法以及澳大利亚与中国的关系的消息来源。

Cheng Lei, a presenter for China Global Television Network (CGTN), is suspected of "criminal activity endangering China's national security".
But now foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the government detained her on "national security grounds", saying authorities had taken "compulsory measures" against her.
He said the police did not detain him, but informed him that he was involved in a "national security investigation," and that he could not leave the country.
Mr Birtles said he was also asked about sources he used to report on Hong Kong's national security law, and on Australia's relations with China.

田鼠喜欢活着的蚂蚁，但蚂蚁是危险的猎物，因为它们在受到威胁时会咬人。
您可能还喜欢：数字提示在成群捕猎猎物时也起着重要作用。
狼经常猎杀大型猎物，例如麋鹿和野牛，但是大型猎物会踢，刺和使狼死。
几乎没有防御能力的动物通常会在大批社交同伴中寻求庇护-数量优势的生存策略几乎不需要解释。
但是，隐藏在大群中并不是唯一涉及数字能力的反捕食策略。

The field mouse loves live ants, but ants are dangerous prey because they bite when threatened.
You might also like:Numerical cues play a significant role when it comes to hunting prey in groups, as well.
Wolves often hunt large prey, such as elk and bison, but large prey can kick, gore, and stomp wolves to death.
Animals that are more or less defenceless often seek shelter among large groups of social companions – the strength-in-numbers survival strategy hardly needs explaining.
But hiding out in large groups is not the only anti-predation strategy involving numerical competence.

霍尔顿说：“如果皇族的养育使皇族显得离那些讨厌傲慢自大且享有正当行为的人们遥远，那将是非常有害的。”
克劳菲感到，莉莉贝特和玛格丽特过着正式的，被隔绝的维多利亚时代的生活，在现代世界中没有地位。
她认为这对他们个人，人民或执政家族成员都不利。
克劳菲引导他们度过了退位，父母意外加冕以及整个第二次世界大战的过程。
拥有30年新闻从业经验的麦克休（McHugh），让自己拥有发明的自由是最难的。

“Royal upbringings can be very damaging if they make royalty seem remote from the people, who hate arrogance and entitled behaviour,” Holden says.
“Crawfie felt that Lilibet and Margaret were living a formal, sequestered, Victorian life which had no place in the modern world.
She thought this wasn’t good for them either personally, as people, or practically, as members of the ruling family.
“Crawfie steered them through the abdication, the unexpected coronation of their parents, and the whole of World War Two.
Allowing herself the freedom to invent was what McHugh, who has behind her a 30-year career in journalism, found hardest.

由于冠状病毒病例激增，从星期一开始，超过六人的社交聚会在英格兰将是非法的，但有一些豁免。
因此，我们正在简化和加强关于社交联系的规则-使它们更易于理解并便于警察执行。
以前，在英格兰的指导下，最多允许来自不同家庭的六人聚会-或来自两个家庭的30人聚会。
大型聚会“最大风险”近年来发生的病例增加已引起部长及其卫生顾问的警觉。
显然，在家庭中，尤其是在室内，当天气变化时更可能发生大型聚会，这是最大的风险。

Image copyright Getty ImagesSocial gatherings of more than six people will be illegal in England from Monday - with some exemptions - amid a steep rise in coronavirus cases.
So we are simplifying and strengthening the rules on social contact - making them easier to understand and for the police to enforce.
Previously, guidance in England allowed gatherings of up to six people from different households - or up to 30 people from two households.
Large gatherings 'greatest risk'The rise in cases seen in recent days has caused alarm among ministers and their health advisers.
Clearly large gatherings in homes - especially indoors which is more likely to happen when the weather turns - present the greatest risk.

北爱尔兰国务卿布兰登·刘易斯（Brandon Lewis）承认，这将以“特定和有限的方式”违反该条约。
据了解，乔纳森爵士是政府最高级的律师，他认为该计划在违反政府根据国际法承担的义务方面走得太远了。
这确实以非常具体和有限的方式违反了国际法。”
这是一个非常不寻常的声明-一位部长站在议会中说，政府正计划违反国际法。
他补充说：“给北爱尔兰的人民和企业以这种确定性和明确性是合理和明智的。”

Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis conceded it would go against the treaty in a "specific and limited way".
Sir Jonathan, who is the government's most senior lawyer, is understood to have believed the plans went too far in breaching the government's obligations under international law.
This does break international law in a very specific and limited way."
This was an extremely unusual statement - a minister standing up in Parliament to say the government is planning to break international law.
He added: "It is reasonable and sensible to give that certainty and clarity to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland."

他们接受了与科列斯尼科娃女士一起离开白俄罗斯的提议，但是当汽车到达边境时，她拒绝越过。
周二早些时候，白俄罗斯官员声称，Kolesnikova女士在试图越境进入乌克兰时被拘留。
周一，目击者看到蒙面男子在明斯克市中心的一条街道上抓住了科列斯尼科娃女士，并将她推入一辆小巴。
官员威胁要起诉他们，直到两人接受与科列斯尼科娃女士一起离开白俄罗斯的要约。
但是卢卡申科先生坚决反对他的统治，现在严重依赖其安全部队。

They accepted an offer to leave Belarus with Ms Kolesnikova but when the car reached the border she refused to cross.
Earlier on Tuesday, officials in Belarus had claimed that Ms Kolesnikova was detained while trying to cross into Ukraine.
On Monday, witnesses saw masked men seize Ms Kolesnikova on a street in central Minsk and push her into a minibus.
Officials threatened to prosecute them until the two men accepted an offer to leave Belarus with Ms Kolesnikova.
But with opposition to his rule strong and persistent, Mr Lukashenko is now heavily reliant on his security forces.

自8月份以来，Fortnite和Apple一直处于法律纠纷之中。Apple强烈反对Fortnite游戏制造商的主张，称其对App Store的控制权使其拥有了垄断地位。
作为回应，苹果公司阻止了Epic通过App Store分发更新或新应用程序的能力，Epic提起诉讼，称苹果的App Store做法违反了反托拉斯法。
两家公司之间的法律之战是在苹果公司对其运行App Store的做法进行越来越严格的审查之际。
欧盟也在调查苹果的App Store行为是否违反了竞争规则。
苹果否认了这些说法，称其App Store使开发人员更容易，更便宜地分发产品。

In response, Apple blocked Epic's ability to distribute updates or new apps through the App Store, and Epic sued, alleging that Apple's App Store practices violate antitrust laws.
The legal battle between the two companies comes as Apple faces increased scrutiny of its practices running the App Store.
The European Union is also investigating whether Apple's App Store practices violate competition rules.
Apple has denied those claims, arguing that its App Store has made it easier and cheaper for developers to distribute products.

该公司表示，将斥资8亿美元（6.14亿英镑）帮助驾驶员改用电动汽车，并与制造商建立合作伙伴关系以确保折扣。
“虽然我们不是第一个在向[电动汽车]过渡时设定宏伟目标的人，但我们打算率先实现这一目标。”
在与监管机构发生冲突的伦敦，优步已经承诺，到2025年，该公司的所有游乐项目都将在电动汽车中实现。
优步周二表示，它正在与雷诺和日产合作，将这一努力扩展到从法国开始的其他欧洲城市。
运动组织运输与环境组织执行董事威廉·托兹（William Todts）表示：“优步（Uber）致力于在欧洲主要城市为其车队快速电气化的承诺是个好消息。

The company said that it would spend $800m (£614m) to help drivers switch to electric cars, creating partnerships with manufacturers to ensure discounts.
"While we're not the first to set ambitious goals in transitioning to [electric vehicles], we intend to be the first to make it happen."
In London, where it has clashed with regulators, Uber had already pledged that all the firm's rides would happen in electric cars by 2025.
On Tuesday, Uber said it was working with Renault and Nissan to expand that effort to other European cities, starting in France.
"Uber's commitment to rapidly electrify its fleet in major European cities is good news," said William Todts, executive director of the campaign group Transport & Environment.

图片说明英国和欧盟对国家援助有不同的看法为什么英国似乎准备牺牲与欧盟在国家援助祭坛上的贸易协定？
戴维·卡梅伦（David Cameron）的前顾问，企业家罗汉·席尔瓦（Rohan Silva）表示，国家援助的确在新的领域而不是旧的领域。
他说，2010年，保守党政府热衷于通过提供慷慨的政府激励措施来鼓励对未来公司的投资，但发现自己受到了欧盟国家援助规则的限制。
欧盟国家援助规则不允许您为了挽救倒闭的公司而捐钱-这被定义为近年来发生经常性亏损的公司。
正如布莱恩·考克斯（Brian Cox）教授今天上午在推特上所说的那样：“英国不能通过国家援助来发展一家与苹果和谷歌抗衡的科技公司吗？

Image caption The UK and the EU have competing visions on state aidWhy is the UK seemingly prepared to sacrifice a trade deal with the EU on the altar of state aid?
Rohan Silva, a former adviser to David Cameron and entrepreneur, says it's in new industries, not old, that state aid is really powerful.
In 2010, he says, the Conservative government was keen to foster investment in the companies of the future by offering generous government incentives, but found itself constrained by EU state aid rules.
EU state aid rules do not allow you to give money to save failing companies - this is defined as companies that made recurrent losses in recent years.
As Prof Brian Cox tweeted this morning: "The UK can't grow a tech company to rival Apple and Google through state aid, surely?
