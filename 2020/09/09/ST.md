新加坡-新加坡单方面重新开放对两国的边界后，来自新西兰和文莱的首批14位游客于周二（9月8日）在樟宜机场降落。
新加坡民航局（CAAS）说，其中五架来自文莱，其余来自新西兰。
它补充说，截至周二下午5点，它已经批准了来自文莱的59名旅客和来自新西兰的77名旅客飞往新加坡。
从文莱到新加坡，每周只有两次航班，总共有500名乘客。
新西兰政府继续劝告所有公民不要出国旅行，尽管它承认新加坡决定开放其边界。

SINGAPORE - The first 14 visitors from New Zealand and Brunei touched down at Changi Airport on Tuesday (Sept 8) following Singapore's unilateral reopening of its borders to the two countries.
Five were from Brunei and the remainder from New Zealand, said the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS).
It added that it had approved 59 travellers from Brunei and 77 from New Zealand to fly to Singapore as of 5pm on Tuesday.
There are only two flights weekly from Brunei to Singapore, flying a total of 500 passengers.
The New Zealand government continues to advise all its citizens not to travel overseas, even as it acknowledged Singapore's decision to open its borders.

## 冠状病毒：进出新加坡的飞机必须设置隔离区以隔离身体不适的乘客

离检疫区最近的厕所也必须留给身体不适的人使用。
新加坡航空（SIA）已在飞机左侧的最后三排座位上设置了此类区域。
CAAS安全监管小组的代理高级主管Alan Foo先生说，当局已于5月在飞机上授权了检疫区。
传染病专家梁和南说，CAAS决定要求隔离区的决定是明智的，这将有效地限制身体不适的乘客对其他人的接触。
强制隔离区超越了国际准则中关于隔离飞行中不适者的步骤。

The lavatory closest to the quarantine area must also be reserved for those who are unwell.
Singapore Airlines (SIA) has set up such zones in the last three rows of seats on the left side of its planes.
Mr Alan Foo, acting senior director of the safety regulation group at CAAS, said the authority had mandated the quarantine area on board planes in May.
Infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam said CAAS' decision to require the quarantine zones is a sensible one that will effectively limit the exposure of an unwell passenger to others.
The mandatory quarantine zone goes a step beyond international guidelines on isolating an unwell person while in flight.

曼谷-蒙面戴手套的缅甸参赞昂山素季（Aung San Suu Kyi）星期二（9月8日）在内比都（Naypyitaw）升旗，拉开了执政的全国民主联盟（NLD）选举的序幕。
在仰光的商业中心，原本充满帆布的街道相对安静，餐馆被迫关闭用餐场所。
像之前的韩国和新加坡一样，缅甸正走向冠状病毒大流行的中期民意调查。
选举定于11月8日。

BANGKOK - A masked and gloved Myanmar State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi kicked off the ruling National League for Democracy's (NLD) election campaign on Tuesday (Sept 8) by raising its flag in Naypyitaw.
In the commercial capital of Yangon, streets that would have been filled with canvassers were relatively quiet, with restaurants forced to shutter dine-in operations.
Like South Korea and Singapore before it, Myanmar is now heading towards national polls, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic.
The election is set for Nov 8.

居住在北京的比勒斯先生随后逃往澳大利亚大使馆，而居住在上海的史密斯先生则在澳大利亚领事馆寻求保护。
比尔特莱斯抵达悉尼后说：“在这种情况下不得不离开，真是令人失望。”
比尔特莱斯和史密斯先生在离开前曾遭到中国当局的讯问，并被问及郑女士。
赵先生说，中国欢迎外国记者，那些遵守法律的人“不需要……担心”。
佩恩女士周二表示，在郑女士被捕后，政府开始关注澳大利亚澳大利亚记者在中国的安全。

Mr Birtles, who is based in Beijing, then took refuge in the Australian embassy, while Mr Smith, who is based in Shanghai, sought protection in the Australian consulate there.
"It's very disappointing to have to leave under those circumstances," Mr Birtles said after arriving in Sydney.
Mr Birtles and Mr Smith were questioned by Chinese authorities before leaving and were asked about Ms Cheng.
Mr Zhao said China welcomes foreign journalists, and those who obey the law have "no need… to worry".
Ms Payne said on Tuesday that the government became concerned about the safety of Australian journalists in China following the arrest of Ms Cheng.

这是特朗普一再做出的承诺。
特朗普说在11月3日大选之前可能会接种冠状病毒疫苗公共卫生专家呼吁保持谨慎。
她写道：“这就是为什么疫苗临床试验通常要持续数月，并且所招募的志愿者远远超过为Covid-19产品招募的志愿者的原因。”
CBS-YouGov在9月2日至9月4日进行的一项调查发现，在最近几周内，对今年开发安全疫苗的怀疑态度有所加深。
三分之二的选民说，如果今年宣布疫苗，他们的第一个想法就是赶紧通过，而不是将其视为科学成就。

This is a promise Mr Trump has made repeatedly.

"This is why vaccine clinical trials usually last for several months and involve far more volunteers than have been recruited for the Covid-19 product," she wrote.
A CBS-YouGov survey conducted between Sept 2 and Sept 4 found that scepticism over development of a safe vaccine this year had deepened in recent weeks.
Two-thirds of voters say that if a vaccine was announced this year, their first thought would be that it was rushed through, rather than viewing it as a scientific achievement.

吉隆坡（路透社）-马来西亚政府周二（9月8日）表示，将寻求重新规划根据中国的``一带一路''贸易倡议在整个半岛建设的一项耗资106亿美元（145亿新元）的铁路项目，并将重新评估成本和与中国承包商的时间表。
在2018年中止该项目后，政府去年恢复了640公里的东海岸铁路线（ECRL），预算削减了三分之一，至440亿令吉（144亿新元）。
它与中国交通建设公司马来西亚分公司CCC-ECRL签约以建造这条线。
哈斯比说：“政府将与中国政府和该项目的总承包商重新谈判，以确定成本和项目实施时间表。”

KUALA LUMPUR (REUTERS) - Malaysia's government on Tuesday (Sept 8) said it will seek to reroute a US$10.6 billion (S$14.5 billion) rail project being built across the peninsula under China's Belt and Road trade initiative, and will reassess the cost and schedule with the Chinese contractor.
The government revived the 640km East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) last year with the budget cut by a third to RM44 billion (S$14.4 billion) after halting the project in 2018.
It contracted the Malaysian unit of China Communications Construction Co, CCC-ECRL, to build the line.
"The government will renegotiate with the Chinese government and the main contractor of the project to ascertain the cost implication and project implementation schedule," Mr Hasbi said.

“现在我的目标是成为总理。
现年71岁的须贺贤一面临最高职位的两个挑战者：现年63岁的前国防部长石芝繁和现年63岁的前外交大臣岸田文雄。
但是，自从2012年12月上任以来一直是安倍晋三可信赖的副官的苏贺先生，如今已成为他的首选继任者，迄今为止，他一直是失控的人选。
同时，长期以来一直对安倍晋三毫不动摇的批评者的石场先生将自己形容为“一个很诚实也很机灵的人”，但发誓要透明。
Suga先生和Kishida先生说，虽然选举只在明年10月举行，但他们表示，当局势得到控制时，他们将考虑进行一次快速选举。

"And now I'm aiming to become prime minister.
Mr Suga, 71, faces two challengers for the top post: former defence chief Shigeru Ishiba, 63, and former foreign minister Fumio Kishida, 63.
But Mr Suga, who has been Mr Abe's trusty lieutenant since coming to power in December 2012 and now his preferred successor, is by far the runaway favourite.
Mr Ishiba, meanwhile, who has long been an unabashed critic of Mr Abe, described himself as someone who is "brutally honest and tactless to a fault" but swears by transparency.
While an election is only due in October next year, Mr Suga and Mr Kishida said they would consider a snap election when the situation is under control.

北京-中国在星期二（9月8日）宣布了一项制定数据安全国际标准的倡议，并呼吁各国政府不要强迫公司交出用户数据。
参加者还应尊重其他成员国的主权，管辖权和数据政策，同时未经其许可不得索取个人数据。
在推出数据安全计划之前不久，中国早些时候已寻求该计划的国际支持，并与多个国家的外交官取得了联系。
根据《海峡时报》看到的一份备忘录，北京表示，该倡议可以为可能的国际标准提供蓝图。
尽管该计划似乎是对美国“清洁网络”计划的立即反应，但分析人士说，中国所反对的可能有些讽刺。

BEIJING - China announced an initiative to develop international standards for data security on Tuesday (Sept 8) and called on governments not to force companies to hand over user data.
Participants should also respect the sovereignty, jurisdiction and data policies of other member nations, while not requesting individual data without their permission.
Shortly before rolling out the data security programme, China had earlier sought international support for the initiative, reaching out to diplomats from several nations.
According to a memo seen by The Straits Times, Beijing said the initiative could provide a blueprint for a possible international standard.
While the initiative appears to be an immediate reaction to the US' "Clean Network" programme, analysts say there could be some level of irony in what China is opposing.

普特拉贾亚（星空/亚洲新闻网）-马来西亚周二（9月8日）宣布了100例新的Covid-19病例，这是自6月10日政府放松运动限制以来的三个月以来最高。
新案件中有62起来自沙巴的Benteng Lahad Datu（LD）团伙，这些团伙来自拘留中心。
努尔·希瑟姆（Noor Hisham）博士说，在劳工组织的62个新案件中，有32人是外国人，而30人是马来西亚人。
在Lahad Datu警察总部对被拘留者进行Covid-19筛查后发现了第一批病例。
在一些有前往拉哈德·达图旅行经历的被拘留者感染那里的其他犯人之后，这些案件传到了约150公里外的斗湖监狱。

PUTRAJAYA (THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Malaysia on Tuesday (Sept 8) announced 100 new Covid-19 cases, the highest in the three months since the government relaxed movement curbs on June 10.
Sixty-two of the new cases came from the Benteng Lahad Datu (LD) cluster in Sabah that originated from detention centres.
Dr Noor Hisham said that of the 62 new cases under the LD cluster, 32 were foreigners while 30 are Malaysians.
The first cases were found following a Covid-19 screening conducted on detainees at the Lahad Datu police headquarters.
The cases spread to Tawau prison some 150km away after some detainees with a travel history to Lahad Datu infected other inmates there.

Mr Xi conferred the Medal of the Republic, the highest national honour, to well-known respiratory disease expert Zhong Nanshan.
China has also helped to save tens of thousands of lives around the world, and showed its sincerity in promoting common good, said Mr Xi in his speech.
Turning to domestic challenges, Mr Xi urged officials and party cadres to develop a long-term strategy to deal with the coronavirus, while the country powers on with its economic recovery.
It has also been the world's largest provider of Covid-19-related medical supplies, exporting 209,000 ventilators, 1.4 billion protective suits and 151.5 billion masks between March 15 and Sept 6, said Mr Xi.
