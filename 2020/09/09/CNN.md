“快乐的劳动-劳动节。”
所以我们打电话给某些人，祝他们劳动节快乐。
拟议的新劳动节口号：“记住我们如何被其他国家剥夺的一天。”
您-您-多少-您要走几英尺？
“我要感谢大家，我只希望祝您劳动节快乐。

"Happy Labors -- Labor Day."
So we called some people, wished them a very happy Labor Day.
Proposed new Labor Day slogan: "A day to remember how we are being ripped off by other countries."
You're -- you're -- how -- how many feet are you away?
"I want to thank you all, and I just want to wish you a very happy Labor Day.

（CNN）毫无疑问，唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）以任何前任总统都没有想到的方式扩大了真相-并打破了真相。
对于许多人来说，这证明了人们没有-也没有-关心特朗普是否诚实。
2016年，特朗普与希拉里·克林顿（Hillary Clinton）竞选，希拉里·克林顿（Hillary Clinton）的数字同样令人沮丧，因为他们“诚实守信”。
因为，选民不信任她。
诚实和守信对选民在2016年无所谓的原因是，他们认为任何一位候选人都没有这些特征。

(CNN) It's beyond debate that Donald Trump has stretched -- and broken -- the truth in ways no past president even contemplated.
Which, for many people, is proof positive that people didn't -- and don't -- care about whether or not Trump is honest.
In 2016, Trump was running against Hillary Clinton, someone who had similarly dismal numbers on being "honest and trustworthy."
Because, well, voters didn't trust her.
The reason honesty and trustworthiness didn't matter to voters in 2016 was that they didn't think either candidate possessed those traits.

伦敦（CNN）内阁大臣在下议院表示，英国正在准备立法，将“以非常具体和有限的方式违反国际法”。
北爱尔兰国务卿布兰登·刘易斯（Brandon Lewis）周二发表评论，以回应有关将于周三发布的立法问题。批评者担心这会改变英国首相鲍里斯·约翰逊（Boris Johnson）上次与欧盟达成协议的脱欧协议的内容。秋季。
这项评论是在政府被迫淡化英国媒体关于它正试图改变《北爱尔兰议定书》的内容的一天后发表的，这是约翰逊政府去年与布鲁塞尔达成的旨在保持开放边界的协议的一部分。在北爱尔兰和爱尔兰共和国之间。
但是，政府试图使国内，布鲁塞尔和世界各地的观众平静下来的努力似乎没有成功。
前总理特蕾莎·梅（Theresa May）谈判了大部分脱欧协议（正式称为“撤出协议”），并在下议院问道：“政府如何才能向未来的国际伙伴保证，可以信任英国遵守英国的法律义务。它签署的协议？”

London (CNN) The UK is preparing legislation which will "break international law in a very specific and limited way," a cabinet minister has said in the House of Commons.
Brandon Lewis, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, made the comment Tuesday in response to a question concerning legislation to be published on Wednesday, which critics fear would alter the contents of the Brexit deal that Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed with the European Union last autumn.
The comment came one day after the government was forced to play down reports in the British media that it was seeking to alter elements of the Northern Ireland Protocol, part of the deal that Johnson's government reached with Brussels last year, designed to keep an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
However, government attempts to calm audiences at home, in Brussels and around the world appear to have failed.
Former Prime Minister Theresa May, who negotiated the bulk of the Brexit deal, formally known as the Withdrawal Agreement, asked in the Commons chamber: "How can the government reassure future international partners that the UK can be trusted to abide by the legal obligations of the agreements it signs?"

（CNN）白俄罗斯获悉总统大选的结果已经过去了五个星期，该国中央选举委员会宣布白俄罗斯总统卢卡申科（Alexander Lukashenko）以80.23％的选票获胜，后者通常被称为欧洲的最后独裁者。
在随后的几周内，该国发生了大规模民众抗议活动，这些公民认为投票是被操纵的，警察严厉镇压了这些抗议者，而且可能最令人不安的是，三个着名的反对派人物-所有都是妇女-从公众视野中消失或逃离白俄罗斯。
白俄罗斯官方媒体周二表示，关键反对派人物玛丽亚·科列斯尼科娃已被拘留在乌克兰和白俄罗斯边界的白俄罗斯一侧。
该声明是由白俄罗斯边境管制局发表的，并在国家电视台播出。
几名反对派候选人被禁止参选或入狱后，科列斯尼科娃与反对派候选人斯维特拉娜·蒂卡诺夫斯卡娅（Svetlana Tikhanovskaya）和维罗妮卡·谢普卡洛（Veronika Tsepkalo）联手在卢卡申科举行大选。

(CNN) Five weeks have passed since Belarus learned the results of its presidential election, in which the country's Central Election Commission announced that President Alexander Lukashenko, often described as Europe's last dictator, had won with 80.23% of the vote.
In the weeks that have followed, the country has seen mass protests from citizens who believe the vote was rigged, violent police crackdowns on those protestors and, possibly most disturbingly, three high-profile opposition figures -- all of whom are women -- have disappeared from public view or fled Belarus.
Belarusian state media said on Tuesday that Maria Kolesnikova, a key opposition figure, had been detained on the Belarusian side of the border between Ukraine and Belarus.
The statement was made by Belarusian Border Control, and aired on state TV.
Kolesnikova joined forces with fellow opposition candidates Svetlana Tikhanovskaya and Veronika Tsepkalo to take on Lukashenko in the election after several opposition candidates were either barred from running or jailed.

“卖单的雪崩”石油市场的最新动荡发生在股票市场的动荡期间。
疲弱的航空旅行正在压低需求。大流行，再加上俄罗斯和沙特阿拉伯之间的价格战，导致今年春天油价暴跌。
美国石油价格甚至有史以来第一次短暂地转为负值，触底至每桶40美元。
这就是为什么美国银行上周晚些时候在一份报告中警告说，全球石油需求“正常化”将需要三年时间。
即使在周二的低点，美国油价仍比4月20日触及的负价高出约75美元。

'Avalanche of sell orders'The latest turmoil in the oil market comes during major turbulence in the stock market.
Weak air travel is depressing demandThe pandemic, along with a price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia, caused oil prices to implode this spring.
US oil prices even briefly turned negative for the first time ever, bottoming at -$40 a barrel.
That's why Bank of America warned in a report late last week that it will take three years for global oil demand to "normalize."
Even at Tuesday's lows, US oil prices are still trading about $75 above the negative prices hit on April 20 .

波音公司认为，水平稳定器问题不构成安全问题，但它将影响未来的交付。

New York (CNN Business) The problems at Boeing continue to mount.
The company disclosed a new problem with the manufacturing of its 787 Dreamliner that will put a further crimp in its aircraft deliveries.
Boeing announced Tuesday a second problem with the 787, this one affecting its horizontal stabilizer on planes that have yet to be delivered.
By contrast, the 787 Dreamliner until recently had been a problem-free aircraft.
The horizontal stabilizer problem is not believed to pose a safety issue, according to Boeing, but it will affect future deliveries.

新德里（CNN）中国和印度周一在喜马拉雅山有争议的边界对峙中指责彼此的部队开火警告，这两个核大国之间的紧张局势明显升级。
据报道，这一事件是四十多年来在中印边界上的第一枪，但双方都指责对方违反了双边协议并采取了“挑衅性”行动。
中国人民解放军西部战区司令部发言人在周一晚间的一份声明中说，印度军队“非法越过”了实际控制线（LAC），这是将两国分开的松散分界线，并进入了神宝山。靠近班公错南岸的区域，这是战略性定位的湖泊，位于2,100英里（3,379公里）长边界的西部。

New Delhi (CNN) China and India have accused each other's troops of firing warning shots during a confrontation Monday on their disputed border in the Himalayas, a marked escalation in tensions between the two nuclear powers.
The incident is reportedly the first time shots have been fired along the Sino-Indian border in more than four decades, but both sides have blamed the other for violating bilateral agreements and taking "provocative" actions.
In a statement on Monday night, a spokesperson for the Chinese People's Liberation Army's Western Theater Command said Indian troops "illegally crossed" the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the loosely defined demarcation line that separates the two countries, and entered the Shenpao mountain region near the southern bank of Pangong Tso, a strategically located lake in the western section of the 2,100 mile (3,379 kilometer) long border.
"The Indian troops brazenly fired warning shots at Chinese border patrols troops who came up to negotiate, and the Chinese border troops were forced to take countermeasures to stabilize the situation," said Senior Colonel Zhang Shuili, the Chinese military spokesperson, without specifying what those "countermeasures" were.
Calling it a "serious military provocation," Zhang asked the India side to "immediately stop dangerous actions ... strictly restrain frontline troops and seriously investigate and punish personnel who fired shots to ensure similar incidents do not occur again."

（CNN）在第二次世界大战期间，一艘由鱼雷击沉的德国军舰在被袭击八十年后，在挪威海床上被发现。
挪威国有电网运营商Statnett惊人地发现了失落的卡尔斯鲁厄巡洋舰在海平面以下1,600英尺（488米）处。
该船长571英尺，仍带有纳粹纳粹记号，在1940年4月入侵挪威南部城市克里斯蒂安桑时发动了攻击。
第二次世界大战爆发七个月前，即1939年9月，挪威宣布保持中立。
希特勒于1940年4月9日下令入侵，德国军队迅速占领了奥斯陆，卑尔根，特隆赫姆和纳尔维克。

(CNN) A German warship sunk by a torpedo during World War II has been found on the seabed off Norway, more than eight decades after it was attacked.
Statnett , the Norwegian state-owned power grid operator, made the astounding discovery of the lost Karlsruhe cruiser around 1,600 feet (488 meters) below sea level.
The vessel, which measures 571 feet long and still bears the Nazi swastika, led an assault on the southern Norwegian city of Kristiansand in the April 1940 invasion of the country.
When World War II had broken out seven months earlier, in September 1939, Norway declared itself neutral.
Hitler ordered its invasion on April 9, 1940, however, and German troops quickly occupied Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim and Narvik.

美国有线电视新闻网首席医学通讯员桑杰·古普塔博士说：“我了解人们对社交距离的渴望，​​但我认为今年也要预防流感也很重要。”
根据医学专家的说法，随着Covid-19大流行在全球迅速蔓延，分发流感疫苗的工作变得更加紧迫。
这就需要前所未有的努力来提高流感疫苗接种率，雷德菲尔德希望将美国的疫苗接种率提高到65％。
为了帮助向有需要的人提供疫苗，疾病预防控制中心购买了930万剂成人流感疫苗和200万剂小儿流感疫苗。
绍尔还说，强制性流感疫苗是一个好兆头，是减少现在和将来流感死亡的重要一步。

"I understand the desire for social distance, but I think it's also important to get a flu shot this year," CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said.
With the Covid-19 pandemic spreading rapidly around the globe, distributing the flu vaccine takes on new urgency, according to medical experts.
That requires an unprecedented effort to boost flu vaccination rates, and Redfield hopes to push US vaccination rates to 65%.
To help get vaccines to those in need, the CDC purchased 9.3 million doses of adult flu vaccine and 2 million doses of pediatric flu vaccine.
Sauer also said the mandatory flu vaccines are a good sign, and an important step in reducing influenza deaths now and in the future.

当维拉·C·鲁宾天文台在2023年开始观测时，其SUV大小的相机将能够每隔几个晚上捕获南方天空的完整全景。
LSST相机项目经理Vincent Riot在一份声明中说：“焦平面将为LSST产生图像，因此它是鲁宾天文台的能力和敏感的眼睛。”
相机的焦平面类似于数码相机中的成像传感器，包括189个传感器，每个传感器提供16兆像素。
捕获第一张图像在LSST相机可以将其眼睛对准天空之前，必须对其进行精密的组装和测试。
接下来是相机的组装：将焦平面和低温恒温器插入相机机身，添加世界上最大的光学镜头，快门和滤镜更换系统。

When the Vera C. Rubin Observatory begins observations in 2023, its SUV-size camera will be able to capture complete panoramas of the southern sky every few nights.
"The focal plane will produce the images for the LSST, so it's the capable and sensitive eye of the Rubin Observatory," said Vincent Riot, LSST camera project manager, in a statement.
The camera's focal plane, similar to an imaging sensor in a digital camera, includes 189 sensors that provide 16 megapixels each.
Capturing the first imagesBefore the LSST camera could point its eye to the sky, it had to undergo delicate assembly as well as testing.
Next comes the assembly of the camera: inserting the focal plane and cryostat into the camera body, adding the world's largest optical lens, shutter and filter exchange system.

2028年，全长39.7英里，耗资66亿美元的隧道系统建成后，它将成为GBT的冠冕，成为世界上最长的铁路隧道。

At its heart is the world's longest railway tunnel -- the 35-mile-long (or 57-kilometer) Gotthard Base Tunnel.
The Ceneri Base Tunnel in southern Switzerland is due to open in December 2020.
SBBA further eight million tonnes has been excavated from the new Ceneri Base Tunnel further south.
As well as the GBT, a second base tunnel is also in operation further west, linking Basel, Bern and Milan.
When the 39.7-mile, $6.6 billion tunnel system is completed in 2028, it will take the GBT's crown as the world's longest rail tunnel.

每个地点都是独一无二的，但斯坦因茨注意到了一个共同的主题-人类正在改变地球。
在2018年《纽约时报》（New York Times）杂志派遣他到各个大洲记录气候变化之后，斯坦梅茨决定整理一本书，收集他整个职业生涯的图像。
“人类星球”记载了我们对环境的影响以及为保护环境而提出的解决方案。
偶然的环保主义者这种对世界的鸟瞰图使Steinmetz能够见证并记录人类改变地球的方式。
这位摄影师说他不打算记录气候变化，但他的工作档案使人类的足迹不可否认。

Each location was unique, but the Steinmetz noticed a common theme -- humans were changing the planet.
After a 2018 New York Times Magazine assignment that sent him to every continent to document climate change, Steinmetz decided to put together a book, collecting images spanning his whole career.
"Human Planet" chronicles our impact on the environment and the solutions we have come up with to try to save it.
The accidental environmentalistThis bird's-eye view of the world allowed Steinmetz to witness -- and document -- the ways humans have changed the planet.
The photographer says he didn't intend to document climate change, but his archive of work made humanity's footprint undeniable.

可爱的动物，卡通超级英雄和艺术杰作-通过吸引人的飞机制服吸引公众注意力时，一切都是公平的游戏。
接下来是一层背景颜色，通常为白色，但并非总是如此（取决于最终的配色方案）。
在此背景层的顶部，借助模板应用了最终的颜色图案。
这些油漆层的厚度非常重要，因为每增加一层油漆都会增加飞机的重量。
所有权变更，航空公司更名，合并和收购也是飞机涂装市场的主要驱动力。

Cute animals, cartoon superheroes and artistic masterpieces -- everything is fair game when it comes to seeking the public's attention through a catchy airline livery.
Next is a layer of background color, which is often white, but not always (it depends on the final color scheme).
It's on top of this background layer that the final color pattern is applied with the help of stencils.
The thickness of these paint layers is very important, since each additional layer of paint adds weight to the aircraft.
Changes of ownership, airline re-brandings, mergers and acquisitions are also major drivers for the aircraft painting market.
